The \u201cfun\u201d element has always been crucial to the game\u2019s dynamics. The battle royale format only makes it more competitive. However, Apex has the edge over others if we compare it with all the other top BR games out there.\n\nThe Gaming Merchant made a recent video where he discussed and showed us few key aspects. He started to list all the legends and segregate them based on who is more \u201cfun\u201d to play with. While it differs from person to person, some features of these characters appeal to everyone. On the other hand, some don\u2019t.\n\nHowever, we can unanimously agree that the list he made depends a lot on how creative we can be. That is also restricted by the abilities vested upon these legends. Some of them do not have any exciting abilities, while others have them in abundance.\n\nMost interesting legends in Apex Legends\n\nThe Gaming Merchant made his list and divided them into five tiers. The top tier (S) was for the Legends, who are the most creative to play with. One may feel differently about this list; however, that does not make it any less fun.\n\nStarting with Loba, he explained how some characters are just blessed with speed. Agility and quick movement, along with ability, automatically make these legends fun to play with. What we are looking for is creative, who can you be most creative with? With respect to that, a player can only get as creative as the character allows.\n\nRead more \u2013 Cheaters To Remain Banned From Valorant\n\nThe legends who spice up the game\n\nDefinitely, on the top tier, there were \u2013 Mirage, Octane, and Pathfinder. Without a doubt, these three deserve the highest spot in this category. Subsequently, they are followed by Loba, Bloodhound, and Caustic. All three of them have one ability that allows the player to exercise creativity.\n\nThe last three tiers had top quality legends, no doubt that they are match winners. However, when the comparison comes down to the \u201cfun\u201d element, they do not qualify. Wraith or Lifeline lack the \u201ccreative abilities\u201d that other legends have.

Campaign signs for President Trump near Wilbur, Wash., in July. President Trump has made accommodating farmers a campaign priority. Credit... Ruth Fremson/The New York Times The Trump administration is expected to announce on Thursday that it will provide $14 billion in additional aid to American farmers, many of whom are suffering economically from the coronavirus, according to a person familiar with the plans. President Trump is expected to mention the aid during a campaign event in Wisconsin on Thursday evening. The details of how the latest tranche of money will be deployed are expected to be announced Friday morning. This would be the second round of aid that the Trump administration delivered to farmers out of the money and borrowing authority that was approved to support the agriculture sector in the economic relief legislation passed by Congress in March. In April, the Agriculture Department announced a $19 billion aid package to help farmers cope with supply chain disruptions and lost business from hotels and restaurants as a result of stay-at-home orders. Farmers were already struggling with the lingering effects of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war with China. After initial concerns about food shortages, many farmers have been dealing with a glut of unused food and crops. Some have resorted to dumping milk in manure pits, burying onions or plowing ripe vegetables back into soil. Mr. Trump has made accommodating farmers a campaign priority, as his most ardent supporters reside in rural America. To help soften the blow of his trade fight with China, Mr. Trump in March approved $23 billion in subsidies to farmers who had lost business as a result of retaliatory tariffs or other trade-related issues. A report from the Government Accountability Office that was released this week raised questions about how some of that aid was distributed. The report from the nonpartisan agency suggested that a disproportionate amount of money went to farmers in southern states and that small farms received less generous payments than big agribusinesses. \u2014\n\nTwo Goldman Sachs employees test positive as workers return to the office.

Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Goldman Sachs is now the latest Wall Street firm to identify coronavirus cases among its ranks. In recent weeks, as more workers have returned to the firm\u2019s downtown Manhattan headquarters, two Goldman employees have tested positive for the virus, according to a company official. One works in one of the firm\u2019s revenue producing businesses and the second is employed in its back-office division, known internally as \u201cthe federation.\u201d The two workers sit on different floors. The cases at Goldman, which company officials believe came from exposure outside the office, come just days after JPMorgan Chase sent workers home after they came in contact with a stock-division employee who was confirmed to have the virus. Like JPMorgan, Goldman has recently encouraged more workers to return to the office this fall. Its tower at 200 West Street, which typically houses about 8,000 workers, is now at about 15 percent capacity, said a company official. More are expected to flow back starting Oct. 5, at which point Goldman will begin a two-team work schedule in which no more than half its returning workers are in the office during any given week to ease social distancing. \u201cOur people\u2019s safety is our first priority and we are taking appropriate precautions to make sure our workplaces remain safe for those who choose to return,\u201d said Leslie Shribman, a Goldman spokeswoman. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnemployment claims fell last week as layoffs persisted. Initial weekly state unemployment claims By Ella Koeze \u00b7 Not seasonally adjusted. Does not include claims made under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. \u00b7 Source: Labor Department New claims for state unemployment insurance fell last week, but layoffs continue to come at an extraordinarily high level by historical standards. Initial claims for state benefits totaled 790,000 before adjusting for seasonal factors, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The weekly tally, down from 866,000 the previous week, is roughly four times what it was before the coronavirus pandemic shut down many businesses in March. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the total was 860,000, down from 893,000 the previous week. \u201cIt\u2019s not a pretty picture,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P Global. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go, and there\u2019s still a risk of a double-dip recession.\u201d The situation has been compounded by the failure of Congress to agree on new federal aid to the jobless. A $600 weekly supplement established in March that had kept many families afloat expired at the end of July. The makeshift replacement mandated by President Trump last month has encountered processing delays in some states and has funds for only a few weeks. \u201cThe labor market continues to heal from the viral recession, but unemployment remains extremely elevated and will remain a problem for at least a couple of years,\u201d said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services. \u201cInitial claims have been roughly flat since early August, suggesting that the pace of improvement in layoffs is slowing.\u201d New claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, an emergency federal program for freelance workers, independent contractors and others not eligible for regular unemployment benefits, totaled 659,000, the Labor Department reported. Federal data suggests that the program now has more beneficiaries than regular unemployment insurance. But there is evidence that both overcounting and fraud may have contributed to a jump in claims. \u2014\n\nBlue Bell is hit with a $17.25 million penalty over 2015 listeria contamination.

Jamie Squire/Getty Image Blue Bell Creameries must pay $17.25 million in criminal penalties for shipments of contaminated products linked to a 2015 listeria outbreak, a federal court in Texas declared on Thursday. The fines constitute the largest-ever criminal penalty following a conviction in a food safety case and are consistent with the terms of a plea agreement filed previously in the case, according to the Department of Justice. Blue Bell, based in Brenham, Texas, pleaded guilty in May to two misdemeanor counts of distributing adulterated ice cream products. Prosecutors in the case charged that the company dispensed products that were manufactured under unsanitary conditions and contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that causes an illness that can be life-threatening. \u201cAmerican consumers must be able to trust that the foods they purchase are safe to eat,\u201d Jeffrey Bossert Clark, an acting assistant attorney general, said in a statement. \u201cThe sentence imposed today sends a clear message to food manufacturers that the Department of Justice will take appropriate actions when contaminated food products endanger consumers.\u201d In April, Chipotle Mexican Grill agreed to pay a $25 million fine \u2014 the largest food safety penalty on record \u2014 to resolve criminal charges accusing the company of serving contaminated food from 2015 to 2018 that made over 1,100 people sick. The agreement allowed the company to avoid conviction if it complied with an enhanced food safety program. \u2014\n\nWalmart will raise wages for 165,000 employees. The pay increase announced by Walmart will affect about 11 percent of the company\u2019s United States employees Credit... Eduardo Munoz/Reuters Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest private employer, said on Thursday that it was raising wages for 165,000 of its workers, as it revamps leadership roles in its stores. The pay increases, which will affect about 11 percent of the company\u2019s United States employees, come as Walmart is undergoing a transformation to be a more digitally focused retailer and seeks to reward and retain its more skilled workers. The starting wages for bakery and deli employees will increase to $15 an hour from $11 an hour, while pay is also being raised by $1 an hour for many employees in the company\u2019s auto car centers. The pay raises do not extend to all of Walmart\u2019s huge work force, but they will no doubt be carefully watched across the broader labor market because the giant retailer sets the benchmark for lower-wage workers. The company also announced that it was replacing certain roles in the stores such as assistant managers and department managers with new management roles with broader responsibilities. Pay for these new \u201cteam leader\u201d roles will range from $18 to $21 an hour and can go up to $30 an hour, Walmart said. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA $300 unemployment supplement is starting to flow, but only retroactively. Filling out paperwork this month at a Mississippi unemployment office. Federal disaster money to supplement other jobless benefits was enough for six weeks. Credit... Rogelio V. Solis/Associated Press A $300 weekly supplement to unemployment payments is starting to reach recipients, but it won\u2019t be any help to the newly jobless. The program, Lost Wages Assistance, was created last month by President Trump with federal disaster funds after Republicans and Democrats were deadlocked on a relief bill. The payments \u2014 half the amount of a federal supplement that expired at the end of July \u2014 are retroactive to the week that ended Aug. 1. But officials said there was money for no more than six weeks, so states have been told that the coverage ended Sept. 5. More than 30 states have begun paying benefits, but \u201cit\u2019s kind of a zombie program,\u201d said Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. \u201cEvery state seems to be doing it differently,\u201d she added, with some paying an $1,800 lump sum to cover six weeks after getting off to a late start. Only South Dakota declined to apply for the funds. People who qualify for at least $100 a week in unemployment benefits \u2014 through regular state programs or a federal pandemic assistance program \u2014 are eligible for the extra funds. According to Federal Emergency Management Agency guidelines, they must certify that disruptions caused by the pandemic made them fully or partly unemployed. Ms. Evermore said that requirement had proved to be a hurdle. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know why they are being asked,\u201d she said, \u201cand there\u2019s a reluctance to answer if they were already getting regular unemployment insurance.\u201d As with the earlier supplement, overwhelmed computer systems have added to delays. Colorado was set to begin making payments this week, but its certification process briefly froze because of demand, news reports said. \u2014\n\nFraud in a federal unemployment program has a new hot spot: Arizona. The Labor Department reported more than 165,000 initial claims in Arizona under the program, an increase from 101,000 the week before. Credit... Ash Ponders for The New York Times The largest surge by far in new claims filed under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program last week was in Arizona, a development that officials there attribute to an increasing problem across the country: fraud. The Labor Department reported more than 165,000 initial claims in Arizona under the program, an increase from 101,000 the week before. Both weeks, only California \u2014 which has also reported widespread fraud \u2014 had a higher tally. \u201cWe are reviewing over one million P.U.A. claims for likely fraudulent activity,\u201d Brett Bezio, deputy press secretary of the Arizona Department of Economic Security, said in an email. To put the number in perspective, he pointed out that the state had received nearly 2.7 million jobless claims, which represents 80 percent of Arizona\u2019s work force. In July, the state\u2019s unemployment rate was 10.6 percent. The pandemic assistance program, part of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act passed in March, was meant to deliver benefits to workers normally ineligible for state unemployment insurance, including freelancers and the self-employed. The program has provided a lifeline to millions, but it has been vulnerable to abuse because it has fewer verification checks than regular state programs. Several states say sophisticated criminal rings are using personal information harvested from wide-scale security breaches. Mr. Bezio said Arizona was working with data analytics companies, financial institutions, as well as state and federal agencies, to review and authenticate applications. By mid-August, he said, the state had approved 90,000 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims, and it is processing an additional 5,000 that it found legitimate. \u2014\n\nWall Street follows global markets lower amid economic concerns. Stocks on Wall Street dropped o n Thursday, a decline led by technology stocks, extending a slump that began the day before after the Federal Reserve said it would need to keep rates near zero for years to ensure an economic recovery, but noted that more immediate action needed to come from Washington.\n\nThe S&P 500 fell nearly 1 percent. Large-cap tech stocks, which have carried the market for much of its recovery since March, lagged on Thursday. Amazon , Apple and Microsoft were all lower.\n\nThe retreat came even as new claims for unemployment benefits in the United States declined last week, government data showed. But at 860,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, the reported number of claims was slightly higher than economists had expected.\n\n\u201cMarket participants have seemingly refocused on the cautious characterization of the economic recovery by the Fed and repeated calls for fiscal stimulus, which, despite a burst of optimism yesterday, does not appear imminent,\u201d analysts with BMO Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Reserve said Wednesday that the economy continued to show weakness, and that policymakers would keep interest rates very low through at least 2023. But with interest rates already near zero, the central bank\u2019s chief again said that the kind of direct spending that only Congress can authorize would be needed to help the economy continue its recovery.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed,\u201d said the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell. Lawmakers have been deadlocked for weeks on any new spending plans.\n\nEuropean indexes were broadly lower , with the FTSE 100 down about half a percent and the Stoxx Europe 600 also lower. Automakers like Volkswagen and Renault dropped after industry data showed European new car sales down more than 17 percent in August compared to a year ago.\n\nIn Asia, nearly every index closed lower. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng lost 1.6 percent, and the Kospi in South Korea fell 1.2 percent. \u2014\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSnowflake\u2019s first day of trading brought investors a blizzard of riches. Snowflake promoted at the Nasdaq MarketSite in Manhattan last month. Credit... Mark Lennihan/Associated Press Shares in Snowflake, the data storage and analytics provider, are poised to fall in their second day of trading today. But they are still set to trade at more than double the price set for its stock-market debut on Wednesday, the latest sign of investors\u2019 insatiable appetite for tech stocks, according to today\u2019s DealBook newsletter. After pricing its stock at $120 apiece in its initial public offering, Snowflake saw its shares open at $245 yesterday, climb to $319 and close at $254. That valued the company at more than $70 billion, which is about the same as Goldman Sachs. (Another tech company that went public yesterday, JFrog, saw its share price jump 50 percent from its I.P.O. level.) Excitement for all things from Silicon Valley has powered a boom in tech investing, especially during the pandemic, which has made people more reliant on the internet for work and life. That means rapidly amassing wealth for executives like Snowflake\u2019s chief executive, Frank Slootman, whose stake is now worth billions, as well as investors like Jack Dorsey of Twitter and Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. But that extreme performance also gives ammunition to critics of traditional I.P.O.s, where investment banks set a stock\u2019s offering price, usually at a slight discount to draw in prospective investors. Some Silicon Valley figures have argued that such deals tend to shortchange companies going public: Bill Gurley, the venture capitalist, asserted yesterday that Snowflake\u2019s stock \u201cpop\u201d shows how \u201cbroken\u201d that process is. And the Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff tweeted: I'm no math whiz, but if $SNOW sold 28 million shares at $120 per share in the IPO and it's now at $275 a few minutes later, then they appear to have left $4.3 billion on the table in the IPO.

Credit... Ting Shen for The New York Times The Federal Reserve\u2019s lending program for state and local governments has drawn scrutiny from a congressional commission tasked with overseeing it, with one Democrat-appointed member of the body calling the limited help states and municipalities are receiving \u201cshameful.\u201d The so-called Municipal Liquidity Facility, which the Fed established with backing from a $454 billion pot that Congress gave to the Treasury Department to support such emergency programs, is meant to buy short-term securities that state and local governments use to finance themselves. The goal is to help those struggling to raise money at reasonable rates on private markets. It is structured to be used only as a backup option, and as of the Fed\u2019s last detailed report, only the state of Illinois and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York had chosen to use it. The lack of use came under fire at the first oversight hearing focused on the municipal program, held Thursday. One of the Fed\u2019s corporate bond buying programs has been more active than the municipal facility, in part because the Fed has used it to proactively buy bonds, rather than waiting for borrowers to tap the program based on preset pricing rules. \u201cIt\u2019s a shameful disparity that reflects this administration\u2019s priorities: taking care of big time executives and wealthy shareholders while abandoning emergency responders, teachers, firefighters, nurses, and all the people who count on their help,\u201d Bharat Ramamurti, a Democrat-appointed commissioner, said at the hearing. \u201cAnd it will further widen the racial income and wealth gaps in this country.\u201d A Republican member of the commission suggested that the program was no longer needed because credit was easily available. \u201cLiquidity in the municipal bond market has been restored, and as such, the MLF, in my view, should wind down,\u201d Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said. While the Fed \u2014 which tries to be independent of politics \u2014 administers emergency lending programs, the Treasury has control of the congressional funds that back up several of them. As a result, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has played a key role in determining credit risk and design in the individual programs. The central bank itself sees many of its market-facing programs as backstops that should avoid crowding out private investors, and which can be successful even if they are lightly used. \u201cThe MLF has contributed to a strong and rapid recovery in municipal securities markets,\u201d Kent Hiteshew, a Fed official who has been instrumental in designing the program, said in remarks prepared for the hearing. \u201cWe are not aware of any cities or counties with populations below the MLF eligibility thresholds that are currently having difficulty accessing capital at affordable rates.\u201d \u2014", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Wed Sep 16 16:57:06 +0000 2020", "id": 1306275931548459009, "id_str": "1306275931548459009", "full_text": "I'm no math whiz, but if $SNOW sold 28 million shares at $120 per share in the IPO and it's now at $275 a few minutes later, then they appear to have left $4.3 billion on the table in the IPO.\nSo on the one hand, congrats on the IPO.

As president of the United States, I have no higher honor than serving as commander-in-chief.\"\n\nTRUMP SAYS PEACE TALKS WITH TALIBAN HAVE RESUMED DURING SURPRISE VISIT TO AFGHANISTAN\n\nBut in order to make the visit, it required intense security and a host of other measures to ensure the news didn\u2019t leak. The journey began Wednesday, where Trump snuck out of Mar-a-Lago.\n\nMany of the details of how he did so are a secret, but the president flew out of an undisclosed airport in Florida on a small, also undisclosed, plane Wednesday evening.\n\nOn that flight was only one Fox News reporter, who was serving as the pool reporter. The plane was bare-bones, except for four blue leather chairs and a port-a-potty that had been brought for the occasion.\n\nAs part of the security measures, phones were taken from all onboard -- including senior White House officials. Trump greeted the crew but remained in the cockpit for takeoff.\n\nWhen the plane landed in Joint Base Andrews later Wednesday evening, Trump switched to Air Force One -- which was not lit up on the tarmac, but was instead hidden in a hangar. It took off from JBA with all interior lights off and the windows drawn.\n\nThe plane landed in Afghanistan on a pitch-black runway, while the pool was only allowed to take pictures of Trump\u2019s arrival from a nearby van. Accompanying Trump was White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere, and Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo.\n\nGrisham said that only a tight circle of White House officials knew about the trip, and the White House even scheduled tweets to be sent out from the president\u2019s account during the Internet blackout that he faced.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous area and he (the President) wants to support the troops,\u201d Grisham said. \u201cHe and Mrs. Trump recognize that there is a lot of people who are away from their families during the holidays and we thought it would be a nice surprise.\u201d\n\nIt certainly was a surprise to the troops, the public and the media -- catching some outlets completely flat-footed.

Trump told them that everyone was working hard to bring them back home.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work tirelessly for the day when all of you can go home to your families\u2026and that day is coming very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nFox News\u2019 Brooke Singman, Andrew O\u2019Reilly and Jenny Buchholz contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.aol.com/article/news/2019/10/26/impeachment-reveals-rifts-as-gop-argues-over-how-to-defend-trump/23847185/", "authors": ["Aol Staff", "Alexander Nazaryan", "Yahoo News"], "title": "Impeachment reveals rifts as GOP argues over how to defend Trump", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Public support for impeachment of President Trump is rising \u2014 and so is anxiety among Republicans who worry that the White House has not done enough to coordinate an aggressive response.\n\nThat lack of uniform messaging has led to freelance efforts to help the president, as well as criticism from supporters of the president over what they deem an insufficient strategy to counter Democrats.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a Senate resolution to condemn House Democrats for the way they have handled the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s attempts to have the Ukrainian government to investigate the family of his political rival, the former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nA co-author of the resolution was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., famous for his ability to count votes and discern shifts in political moods. And yet McConnell was not standing alongside Graham as the South Carolina senator argued his case at a press conference. For that matter, neither were any of the more than 40 other Republicans who endorsed the measure, giving what should have been a show of force the feel of a one-man show.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s office would not say on record why he didn\u2019t attend the resolution\u2019s announcement. Later reports indicated that some Republicans were uneasy with Graham\u2019s original pro-Trump language, which McConnell worked to soften.\n\nImpeachment proceedings against Trump are entering their most consequential stage yet, with a raft of witnesses slated in the coming days and a House vote on articles of impeachment perhaps only a month away. Even so, Republicans \u2014 many of whom face reelection in 2020 \u2014 are still struggling to figure out how to defend Trump. There is little consensus about whether to attack impeachment on substance or on process, which is being led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the House Intelligence Committee chairman who is widely despised by the right.\n\nAnd while somelegislators have been vociferous in standing up for Trump, others have laid low. One top Republican operative in Washington told Yahoo News that it was a mistake to not have a single official coordinating an impeachment response from inside the White House.\n\n\u201cThe president needs to put one person in charge of the impeachment defense,\u201d the operative said. He added that having White House counsel Pat Cipollone or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney working on impeachment in addition to the respective responsibilities each already carries was poor management.\n\n\u201cThey should not be running this,\u201d he said of the two men, who are said to be vying for influence over how to handle impeachment.\n\nThe lack of a central Republican strategy much was in evidence Friday morning, when Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., appeared on \u201cWar Room: Impeachment,\u201d the new impeachment-focused radio show hosted by Steve Bannon, the former White House chief political strategist. Bannon launched the show earlier this week out of frustration with what he saw as a disorganized, unfocused response to what he sees as a grave threat to Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cNo more just taking punches,\u201d Bannon said at the opening of Friday\u2019sepisode, in what could serve as the program\u2019s theme.\n\nBannon showered praise on Gaetz, who earlier this week led a Republican storming of the secure basement room in the U.S. Capitol, where witnesses were testifying in front of the impeachment panel. While the president\u2019s critics saw the move as little more than a disruptive stunt, loyalists like Bannon were thrilled to watchmembers of Congress come so forcefully to Trump\u2019s defense.\n\nTwo days later, Gaetz said he had no regrets. \u201cI thought we worked \u2019em pretty silly,\u201d he said, describing how surprised Democrats were to see a gang of Republicans making its way through the door of a secure facility where intelligence matters are often discussed well out of public view. \u201cIt was almost like watching cockroaches scatter when you turn the lights on,\u201d Gaetz said of his Democratic foes.\n\nNotably absent from the show of force was House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the chamber\u2019s leading Republican \u2014 a fact that was not lost on Bannon. After the Gaetz action was concluded, Bannon criticized McCarthy for a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview in which, according to Bannon, McCarthy came off as a \u201ccomplete and total buffoon\u201d who was unprepared to discuss the details of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nMcCarthy, Bannon added, needed to \u201cjump in here and get engaged.\u201d\n\nOne Republican staffer on Capitol Hill cautioned against drawing conclusions about fractures in the Republican conference.\u201cI\u2019ve rarely seen our caucus this riled up. We\u2019re totally united in fighting Schiff\u2019s secret impeachment,\u201d the staffer added. \u201cAcross the board, members think this whole thing is a farce, and you\u2019ll see little dissent from that view.\u201d\n\nThe staffer acknowledged that \u201cSenate Republicans are quieter,\u201d but so were, in his estimation, Democrats in the upper chamber, with both parties \u201ckeeping their powder dry over there.\u201d\n\nAs for McCarthy, a spokesman said that he supported Gaetz\u2019s effort, even if he wasn\u2019t present for it. \u201cHouse Republicans are speaking with one voice against the undemocratic impeachment process,\u201d the spokesman said, pointing to efforts like a resolution to censure Schiff that was introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and roundly supported by this Republican colleagues.\n\nGOP fractures, however, extend beyond the House. After all, that chamber is controlled by Democrats. The Senate and White House, meanwhile, are in Republican control, making them natural epicenters of pro-Trump impeachment initiatives. But so far, such initiatives have been limited.\n\nGraham acknowledged as much during Thursday\u2019s press conference. \u201cWhat's missing here, I think, is that coordinated effort to put somebody in charge of developing a message and delivering it,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI believe that's about to be corrected, I hope.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to that same point, Gaetz said on Bannon\u2019s show that he disagreed with Mulvaney, who last week told reporters that Trump did not need to institute a concerted, coordinated anti-impeachment effort stemming from the White House. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a war room when you haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201d Mulvaney said, in what has been widely described as a disastrous appearance in the White House press briefing room.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring back the killer class,\u201d Gaetz said, eliciting laughter from Bannon. \u201cWe need the killers, OK? We are not going to win this impeachment at a K Street martini party,\u201d he added, using shorthand for establishment Washington.\n\nAt one point, Bannon\u2019s co-host, Jason Miller, a former top Trump campaign official, referred to the Florida congressman as \u201cSpeaker Gaetz,\u201d suggesting that 37-year-old had become the de facto leader of the Republican conference in the House. Later in the show, Bannon called him \u201cthe future speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nAs Bannon interviewed Gaetz, a CNN screen behind him relayed news that former treasury official Tony Sayegh had been selected by the White House to lead its messaging strategy on impeachment. Sayegh is a favorite of Bannon and his allies, and Bannon speculated that his name had been leaked by powerful detractors within the White House in order to harm the potential hire.\n\nThat same morning, Axios reported that an informal war room was meeting in the White House, though it consisted of extant staff, not new hires. One detail from the report bothered Bannon: the time of the daily war room meetings.\n\n\u201cHey guys, note to self, 10 o\u2019clock, the day is over,\u201d Bannon joked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start meeting at 6 or 7 in the Roosevelt Room? Make it focused over there. Ten o\u2019clock? Isn\u2019t that lunch?\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\nMore from :\n\nKellyanne Conway denies saying WH would probe reporter's life\n\nTrump's 'lynching' tweet draws outrage and some Republican support\n\n\n\n\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/2020/06/18/nfl-free-agent-wide-receivers-deebo-samuel/", "authors": ["Kyle Madson", "Hour Ago"], "title": "Free agent wide receivers 49ers can target while Deebo Samuel is out", "text": "The 49ers on Thursday got some bad injury news.

The sum is expected to grow even larger following Freddie Kitchens\u2019 dismissal on Monday.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe Browns fired Kitchens after just one season as head coach following a disappointing campaign. Cleveland had high expectations after acquiring superstar wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in the offseason, but second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield regressed under Kitchens\u2019 tutelage and the team finished the season with a 6-10 record.\n\nWhile the Browns never publicized the financial details of Kitchens\u2019 contract, most coaches sign multi-year deals when accepting an NFL team\u2019s top job. As a result, Cleveland owner Jimmy Haslam will likely be paying both Kitchens and the coach hired as his successor during the 2020 season.\n\nNFL BLACK MONDAY: WHY HEAD COACH FIRINGS CAN COST TEAMS FOR YEARS\n\nThe Browns did not immediately respond to FOX Business\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe dual financial commitment would be the continuation of a costly trend for Browns management. The team was still paying Kitchens\u2019 predecessor, Hue Jackson, through the 2019 season, despite the fact that he was fired in the early stages of the 2018 season.\n\nThe Browns paid him his full $4.75 million base salary for the 2018 season, even as he worked on the Cincinnati Bengals\u2019 coaching staff, ESPN reported at the time. Jackson\u2019s contract with the team ran through 2019.\n\nJackson was hired in 2016 to replace Mike Pettine, who was fired after amassing a 10-22 record over two seasons. The Browns fired Pettine with two years left on a contract worth $3.5 million per year, according to Crain\u2019s Cleveland Business analysis.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPettine's predecessor, Rob Chudzinski, was fired with more than $10 million left on his contract, while Pat Shurmur had $5.6 million left on his deal.\n\nCrain\u2019s estimated that the Browns owed more than $55 million in dead salary to fired coaches from 1999 through 2012.\n\nWhile the Browns have dealt with a particularly high level of coaching staff turnover in recent years, they are hardly the only NFL franchise dealing with poor investments in the critical leadership role. Since coaching salaries tend to include partial or full guarantees, the decision to fire a head coach is made with the knowledge that teams will owe the balance of the deal.\n\nStandard offset language in coach contracts can lessen the financial impact. In most cases, if a fired coach lands another job in the NFL or college football, their previous employer is only required to cover any difference in salary, rather than the full amount dictated in their original contract.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXBUSINESS.COM", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.mandatory.com/wrestlezone/news/1148538-first-patch-update-for-wwe-2k20-released", "authors": [], "title": "WWE 2K20 Patch 1.02 Update Released; Addresses Gameplay And Graphics, Online Stability, More", "text": "The WWE 2K Games team have released a patch update resolving a list of issues that the initial release of WWE 2K20 had.

It is intended for local use on a trusted network as there is no authentication or verification in place.\n\nCallStranger is now identified as CVE-2020-12695 and can be leveraged remotely without authentication. It was discovered by cybersecurity researcher Yunus \u00c7adirci and reported to the Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF) - the organization currently developing UPnP - on December 12, 2019.\n\nThe flaw is in UPnP\u2019s SUBSCRIBE function. More specifically, it is caused by the Callback header value, which can be controlled by an attacker \u201cand enables an SSRF-like vulnerability,\u201d \u00c7adirci explains.\n\nAccording to the researcher, an attacker exploiting CallStranger can bypass network security devices and data loss prevention solutions designed to prevent sending critical/sensitive information outside the corporate network.\n\n\u201cWe see data exfiltration as the biggest risk of CallStranger. Checking logs is critical if any threat actor used this in the past,\u201d the researcher highlights, adding that it can also serve the following nefarious purposes:\n\n- launch amplified reflected TCP DDoS attacks from millions of UPnP devices reachable over the public web\n\n- scan internal ports from internet-facing UPnP devices\n\n\u00c7adirci wrote a script that can check which devices on the network are susceptible to CallStranger attacks. It essentially finds all UPnP devices, services, and endpoints on the local network.\n\nThe CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon warns that UPnP should not be available over the internet as it opens the door to a host of other vulnerabilities. The recommendation is to implement the latest specifications from the OCF.\n\nA simple search for UPnP on Shodan search engine shows that there are almost 5.5 million devices exposed on the public web.\n\nLong-term fix\n\nDespite a patch being available for almost two months, updating all devices is unlikely to happen any time soon, if ever. It mainly depends on vendors to implement the fix and this takes time when dealing with protocol vulnerabilities. Furthermore, many devices may no longer be supported or are not able to receive updates.\n\n\u00c7adirci says that not all UPnP stacks are vulnerable, though. For instance, miniupnp is not.

Britain has declared the new coronavirus that emerged from China a \"serious and imminent threat to public health'' and announced new measures Monday to combat the spread of the disease. (Steve Parsons/PA via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) \u2014 A businessman from England who contracted the new virus from China and may have spread it through his wide travels thanked Britain\u2019s National Health Service after he recovered.\n\nSteve Walsh issued a statement Tuesday after being the focus of intense media coverage once it became apparent that he may have unwittingly helped to spread the new coronavirus to Europe. Walsh had come into contact with the virus after a business trip to Singapore in January. He then went to a ski resort in the French Alps, potentially infecting other people before he was diagnosed with the virus and hospitalized.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank the NHS for their help and care,\u2019\u2019 Walsh said. \u201cWhilst I have fully recovered, my thoughts are with others who have contracted coronavirus.\u2019\u2019\n\nFive Britons who stayed with Walsh at a chalet in the Alps have been diagnosed with the virus, including a 9-year-old boy. Another man who stayed at the French ski resort was discovered infected after returning home on the Spanish island of Mallorca.\n\nHis case prompted French health authorities to test 61 other children and family members at the resort and temporarily close some schools there, but they all tested negative.\n\nWalsh said as soon as he realized he had been exposed to a confirmed case of the virus, he spoke to his doctor and public health authorities.\n\n\u201cI was advised to attend an isolated room at the hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the diagnosis was confirmed, I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe virus has infected more than 43,000 people globally and killed over 1,000, with the overwhelming majority of cases in China. It is unclear exactly how it is transmitted, but experts think it is spread mostly by droplets when people cough or sneeze. Health officials warn it can take up to 14 days for those who have been exposed to show symptoms.\n\nMost people have only mild symptoms such as a fever and runny nose. But some develop pneumonia. Those who have fallen severely ill have been mostly over 60 with other health problems.\n\nWalsh flew to Singapore for a Jan. 20-22 event sponsored by his employer, Servomex. The company, based in the town of Crowborough, 35 miles south of London, makes industrial sensors sold around the world.\n\nIn a statement, Servomex said it was working with public health authorities \u201cto ensure the welfare of our staff and communities and wish anyone with the virus a quick and full recovery.\u201d\n\nEurope has reported 43 confirmed virus cases.\n\nOne infected woman in Russia has recovered and was discharged from the hospital, local officials said.\n\nRussia has halted most of its air traffic to China, suspended trains to China, closed the Russian border with China and Mongolia and temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens.\n\n___\n\nRead all the AP stories about the coronavirus outbreak that emerged from China at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.salon.com/2019/08/30/after-ignoring-climate-at-g7-trump-gets-back-to-work-killing-the-planet/", "authors": [], "title": "After ignoring climate at G7, Trump gets back to work killing the planet", "text": "President Trump made a show of opposing his fellow G7 leaders on climate change and Russia.

After skipping the G7\u2019s climate meeting and arguing that oil \u201cwealth\u201d trumps any environmental concerns, the Environmental Protection Agency announced that it would gut federal regulation of methane, a greenhouse gas linked to climate change.\n\nThe proposed rule would reverse Obama-era standards requiring oil and gas companies to inspect and prevent methane leaks in drilling wells, pipelines, and storage facilities, The Wall Street Journal reported, and suggests that the federal government does not have the authority to regulate methane.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAccording to EPA data, methane makes up more than 10 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., with about half of that coming from emissions generated by oil and gas companies.\n\nThe Trump administration estimated that gutting the rules would save the oil and gas industry at least $17 million per year.\n\nKassie Siegel, who heads the advocacy group Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Washington Post that the rollback shows \u201ccomplete contempt for our climate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cThe Obama rule was like a Band-Aid on a gaping wound,\u201d she said said. \u201cThe Trump administration is so fanatical that they couldn\u2019t even live with the Band-Aid. They had to rip off the Band-Aid.\u201d\n\nTrump also directed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to gut restrictions preventing logging at Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest, the Post reported, which would allow logging, drilling and mining at the largest national forest in the country.\n\nEnvironmental advocates likened the move to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro opening up the Amazon to logging interests, leading to an alarming increase in rainforest wildfires.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\"President Trump's attack on the Tongass National Forest is like the fires burning in the Amazon \u2014 it's a huge threat to a major climate change buffer and to lands and wildlife that have global significance,\" Eric Jorgensen, the managing attorney for the Alaska-based advocacy group Earthjustice told Newsweek.\n\nIts old growth trees are the greatest carbon sanctuary in the U.S. national forests, helping us all as a counterweight against climate change. This ecologically rich landscape and all the benefits it brings will be lost if roads and chainsaws are allowed to carve it up.

By about the third week of camp, players are pretty tired of going up against the same opponent and same scheme day after day. Joint practices offer players an opportunity to match up against a player with a different skillset in individual periods and against a different scheme in team periods.\n\nThe element of having two NFL teams involved in practice usually increases the tempo and ramps up the competition. It\u2019s a great evaluation tool for coaches to see how their players measure up against another team. It gives them a better gauge of where their team stands at that point in camp.\n\nIt\u2019s also good for the starters, who typically don\u2019t see a lot of game action in the preseason until Week 3. For a player like quarterback Matthew Stafford, he gets a ton out of going against another defense in a controlled environment for two or three days. Those 7-on-7 and team periods are invaluable for him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for us,\u201d Stafford said after a joint practice last year in Oakland. \u201cOur defense is a little bit different style than their defense is here in Oakland, so it\u2019s good for our guys to have to adjust.\n\n\u201cIn the grand scheme of things in a season, you\u2019re going to play defenses that have a bunch of different personalities and a bunch of different styles. It\u2019s nice for us to get a little bit of a taste for that.\u201d\n\nIn these practice settings, coaches can control the situations they want to see or feel they need to work on. Red zone, blitz pickup, third-down situations, 9-on-7 and two-minute situations are all terrific reps to go through in a controlled environment of joint practice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun for us to go out there and compete against other guys,\u201d Stafford said in Oakland last year. \u201cWe have a full spring of competing against each other and then we come in to training camp and compete against each other for a couple weeks.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2475324/people-are-raving-about-spider-man-far-from-homes-post-credits-scenes", "authors": [], "title": "People Are Raving About Spider-Man Far From Home's Post-Credits Scenes", "text": "People Are Raving About Spider-Man Far From Home's Post-Credits Scenes Dirk Libbey Random Article Blend Facebook\n\n\n\n\n\ncinemablend\n\n\n\nEmail While we all go into Marvel Cinematic Universe movies wondering what the film has in store for us, the other question that we're all also wondering is, what's going to happen next? We usually get a tease of the future of the MCU in the form of extra scenes added to the middle or end of the credits, and not only does Spider-Man: Far From Home have such scenes, based on the way people are talking, those scenes are going to be huge. The first social media reactions to Spider-Man: Far From Home dropped this week and while most everybody had good things to say about the film, a lot of curiosity, and a lot of praise, surrounded the post-credits scenes. As our own Sean O'Connell put it... A lot of people have asked. Yes, there are two Spider-Man: Far From Home end-credits sequences. They are VERY important. First one, without hyperbole, made me RIDICULOUSLY excited for the future of Spider-Man in the MCU. AVOID SPOILERS and EXPERIENCE IT fresh, at all cost. Excelsior! Obviously, everybody who has seen the movie is trying to avoid spoilers, so we have zero details about what the scene or scenes that we're getting will be all about. But based on the reactions, it sounds like they will very much set the stage for whatever is to come in the MCU. Inverse says the scenes are going to have fans talking about them not just after the movie is over, but for a long time afterward. [T]he post-credits scenes in Spider-Man Far From Home are some of the most ambitious since the first avengers movie. MCU fans will be talking about these scenes for years While the scenes are clearly a big deal for the entire MCU, JoBlo says that the scenes are really going to resonate specifically with Spider-Man fans. SPIDER-MAN fans will lose their minds during one of the post-credits scenes. Not gonna say anything more, but it's just... so right. There are, of course, a few different theories one could surmise based on what we do know about Spider-Man: Far From Home. The trailers have told us that the movie will deal with Marvel's multiverse and the movie's director has seemingly confirmed this isn't all part of a Mysterio trick. This certainly opens up a lot of potential storytelling opportunities for the MCU going forward, so a post-credits scene that gives us a glimpse of one of these other universes could certainly set things up going forward. Of course, Spider-Man: Far From Home isn't even the first Spider-Man movie to set up the multiverse concept. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse did it first, and that opens up an entirely new set of possibilities. Could we see Far From Home just takes place in another universe adjacent to the ones we saw in the animated film? Could we see other Spider-Man franchises produced by Sony, officially made part of the multiverse, and by extension the MCU? Something like that would certainly make Spider-Man fans lose their minds. Fans will certainly be excited to check out Spider-Man: Far From Home when it debuts in a couple of weeks.

American scientists discovered these youngsters develop healthier diets and eat more fruit as teens than their peers who drank less than half a cup of pure juice a day when they were younger. And, contrary to previous research, the study found drinking more fruit juice, which is naturally high in sugars, does not put children at greater risk of being overweight. Lead researcher, Dr Lynn Moore from Boston University, said: 'We know that whole fruit intake as well as diet quality typically decline from early childhood through adolescence. 'Children who consumed about 1.5 cups of 100 per cent fruit juice a day during the preschool years tended to maintain healthier diets into adolescence than children who drank less than half a cup per day during preschool.'

He\u2019d like to make amends for the old Howard Stern.", "text": "\n\n\u201cI tried to watch some of my old Letterman [appearances],\u201d says Howard Stern, photographed in his New York studio in May. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get through two minutes of it.\u201d (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\nYears ago, when his main source of pleasure came from taunting Kathie Lee Gifford or watching porn stars disrobe in his studio, Howard Stern took his public appearances very seriously. The self-proclaimed \u201cKing of All Media\u201d would storm onto late-night talk shows, all sunglasses and hair-metal locks, and proceed to do whatever he could to take over.\n\nHe mocked Jay. He mocked Dave. He mocked Arsenio. He mocked the size of his own penis. He wore a buttocks-baring \u201cFartman\u201d costume to the MTV Video Music Awards. All of this led to headlines and huge ratings. And yet today, that version of Stern makes him \u201ccringe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried to watch some of my old Letterman [appearances], Stern said on a recent morning during an interview at his SiriusXM radio studio. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get through two minutes of it. It\u2019s just not me. I don\u2019t know who that guy is.\u201d\n\nThat brings us to \u201cHoward Stern Comes Again,\u201d a new 549-page collection of his radio interviews that he hopes marks his evolution from an impatient and often nasty blabbermouth to a master conversationalist. In the foreword, Stern dismisses his previous two bestsellers, 1993\u2019s \u201cPrivate Parts\u201d and 1995\u2019s \u201cMiss America.\u201d He also distances himself from his previous persona. As he sees it, the old Howard was an insecure narcissist so terrified his audience would turn the dial that he bullied his guests to either submit or flee. The new Howard is a kinder, happier and more generous entertainer freed from the constrains of shock jockdom. The beginning of that transformation, he says, is easy to chart: The end of his 23-year marriage to Alison Berns in 2001. Miserable and disappointed, fearing how his three daughters would view him, Stern began seeing a psychotherapist four days a week.\n\n\n\nAn unidentified fan gets in a squeeze of Stern during his \u201cFartman\u201d routine at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1992. (Kevork Djansezian/Associated Press)\n\nNot all of his fans are happy with what he describes as his \u201cpersonal evolution.\u201d Some have gone online to blast this Howard Stern as a celebrity-boot-licking sellout who has lost his way. Stern is not particularly bothered by this.\n\n\u201cI do radio differently now than I did then,\u201d says the 65-year-old host. \u201cHave you ever tried to go back and look at your old photographs or your old anything or articles maybe you wrote and you say, \u2018No, I\u2019m a better writer now, a better performer \u2014 or not even better, but I do things in a different way.\u2019\u201d\n\n[From 2015: Is Howard Stern going soft or just getting sharper?]\n\n\u201cHoward Stern Comes Again\u201d arrived with little warning. A few months ago, the image of the book\u2019s cover, with no details other than its title, appeared on Amazon and promptly shot to No. 1. Only in the past few weeks did Stern reveal what would be inside \u2014 a personally curated collection of transcripts, with meaty introductions in which he offers some context for the interviews. The subjects range from comedians (Amy Poehler, Steve Martin, Bill Murray) to musicians (Paul McCartney, Madonna, Jay-Z) to a pre-scandal Harvey Weinstein, who smugly dismisses the idea anybody could be taken advantage of on the casting couch. There is a chapter devoted to Stern\u2019s most frustrating non-get, Hillary Clinton, as well as 11 excerpts from interviews with Donald Trump, a frequent guest long before he entered the White House. Stern\u2019s relationship with Trump effectively ended during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\u201cDonald asked me to come speak on his behalf at the convention, and I had to be honest with him, and it was not comfortable,\u201d says Stern. \u201cI said, \u2018Donald, that\u2019s not where my heart lies.\u2019 . . . I wanted Hillary Clinton to win. . . . Would she have now been president had she done my show? I\u2019m not saying that, but I am saying the attitude of Joe Biden if he becomes a nominee or Mayor Pete or whoever it is, they better keep in mind. Trump speaks like a dude. I\u2019m talking about his manner of speech, not the intellectual capacity, not the desire to be president, not the policy, but he talks in clips where people understand what he\u2019s saying. Whether you agree with him or not. And it\u2019s a good lesson for Hillary, and this is what I try to point out in the book.\u201d\n\nStern was not always trying to coax presidential candidates into his studio. He began his rise in the 1980s at Washington\u2019s DC101, launching lesbian \u201cDial-A-Date,\u201d doing a bit that made light of the Air Florida crash in the Potomac River and openly dissing station management. He got fired, not for the first time, before landing at New York\u2019s WNBC. Over the next two decades, as he moved to syndication, Stern created his own universe, made up of the competitors he openly taunted and the cadre of regular call-in misfits known as the \u201cwack pack,\u201d and defined by a focus on sex that led to Stern being popularly labeled a \u201cshock jock.\u201d He also racked up millions of dollars in fines from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\n\n\nStern in a prison-style uniform at a rally in Manhattan in April 1987, at a time when he was being censured by the FCC.

(Mark Lennihan/Associated Press)\n\nThat incarnation of Stern did not get to interview former Beatles or Oscar winners. His guests were more likely D-listers, supporting players to whatever scandal-of-the-moment, such as Jessica Hahn or John Wayne Bobbitt.\n\nBecause when Stern did get an actual celebrity in the studio, he often blew it. Listen to him barely coax a chuckle out of Eddie Murphy. Or pester Gilda Radner with lame sex-life questions, oblivious to her discomfort until she cut the interview short and left.\n\nStern\u2019s on-air persona left potential subjects wary.\n\n\u201cHoward was the last guy you wanted to menace,\u201d says Letterman, who first hosted Stern on his NBC \u201cLate Night\u201d show in 1984. \u201cHe said some unpleasant things about my wife and just various little things, and I just thought, \u2018What did I do to this guy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just felt like he would turn on me,\u201d says Ellen DeGeneres, who resisted going on Stern\u2019s show in the 1990s. \u201cThe humor was very aggressive, and I was just scared of that humor. I was scared of him and getting hurt by him or slammed by him, and he had massive fans. And I thought he could influence people to not like somebody if he didn\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\nStern\u2019s power was clear when, in 2004, he announced he would leave terrestrial radio for satellite. SiriusXM\u2019s listener base jumped from about 600,000 subscribers to more than 6 million by the end of Stern\u2019s first year on the service.\n\nBy then, his evolution had begun. Post-divorce, he met and eventually married Beth Ostrosky, a model and animal-rights activist. He also found himself under less pressure at work: The FCC has no oversight of satellite, and SiriusXM does not have ratings. The therapized Stern began to make amends. He even apologized to Letterman for attacking him, violating his confidence and saying nasty things about the late-night host\u2019s wife, Regina Lasko.\n\n\u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Well, this is interesting,\u2019\u201d says Letterman. \u201cIf he\u2019s apologizing to me, and I was never the central target, there is a pretty long list of people Howard must be apologizing to. And then when I would have him on the show, from that point on he was a different guy. You could actually sit and have a conversation, and he was thoughtful and he was smart and he was just empathetic. Not the enemy of humanity that people perceived him to be. And then I realized, well, you know, I really do like this guy.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres decided to go his show in 2015. They talked about her difficult childhood, including how she was molested by her stepfather.\n\n\u201cAnybody who is aggressive and a bully usually is that way because they don\u2019t like themselves and they take it out on other people,\u201d she says. \u201cYou only treat other people the way you would treat yourself. If you have compassion and empathy for yourself, you would have it for other people.\u201d\n\n\n\nStern with SiriusXM CEO Mel Karmazin and Nasdaq President and CEO Robert Greifeld at the NASDAQ opening bell in January 2006. His deal with SiriusXM made Stern rich \u2014 and relieved the worst of his career stress. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nStern never intended to put out a third book. The first two were excruciating to write, particularly because of his obsessive-compulsive disorder. But Simon & Schuster publisher Jonathan Karp, a fan dating back to his high school days in the 1980s, approached Stern two years ago with a proposal.\n\nKarp wanted to focus on Stern\u2019s interviews. He had his staff transcribe dozens of them and presented them in a 256-page galley entitled \u201cHoward Stern: The Interviews.\u201d The idea was that Stern would barely have to do any work.\n\nBut as days passed, Stern realized he couldn\u2019t simply tinker with the prototype. He tore it apart and started from scratch.\n\n\u201cI think their notion was that this could be wrapped up quickly. And even Don [Buchwald], my agent, was kind of like, yeah, I don\u2019t think this is that work-intensive, and I went, \u2018I don\u2019t know about that.\u2019 I would keep finishing the book, quote-unquote, \u2018finishing.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat happened seven times, says Karp, who admits he found the process perplexing. He had been hoping to publish Stern\u2019s book in time for the 2017 Christmas season.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Howard, this is great. Why can\u2019t you let go?\u2019 And he basically said, \u2018It\u2019s just not what I wanted it to be.\u2019 Did I ever fear that he would never let go? Yes. Absolutely.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Karp says the book that emerged was clearly better than the other iterations. And Stern says he feels that it shows his personal growth. In the past, he would badger a guest, hoping to shake his subject to open up. Now, he prepares notes and reviews them with an assistant before going into the interview and tries to be patient. He will also work to make a guest feel comfortable.\n\nFor Sia, the Australian-born singer and songwriter, Stern agreed to turn off the studio cameras, in deference to her tendency to hide her face while performing. He opened the interview by praising her voice and her song, \u201cDiamonds.\u201d Before long, Sia found herself talking about depression, conflicts with her father and alcoholism. She even began to cry on air.\n\n\n\nStern insists he is still irreverent. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve somehow gone through this metamorphosis.\u201d (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cIt was an unusual interview,\u201d says Sia. \u201cMost interviews are exactly the same, and they don\u2019t stand out and they blur into one. But this interview, for some reason, it felt like it was the first time I\u2019d sort of had an opportunity to give a voice to my past and what had happened. I felt valued and just very genuinely appreciated by him. And it was bizarre, because I\u2019ve just never had an emotional outburst during an interview.\u201d\n\nStern says he is still irreverent. The show, which he does three days a week, doesn\u2019t shy away from pranks, inter-staff squabbles or sex talk. But he protects certain relationships, whether with his wife or celebrity friends. He also believes his more patient approach with guests results in revelations that would have been impossible in his WNBC days.\n\nIn 2015, he had actress Gwyneth Paltrow on the show. Rather than pull a Gilda Radner, he talked to her about her relationship with her parents, her choices in movie roles and her approach to divorce \u2014 a process she had been mocked elsewhere for calling \u201cconscious uncoupling.\u201d Paltrow grew comfortable and began to poke fun at herself; she even talked frankly about her philosophy that a certain sex act is the best way to settle an argument with a spouse.\n\n\u201cGwyneth Paltrow would never have touched my show in the old days, because she would have walked in and I would have said, \u2018Hey, Gwyneth you\u2019re really hot\u2019 for 25 minutes, and then I would have said, \u2018Hey, you ever . . .?\u201d says Stern. \u201cAnd she would\u2019ve run out of the studio. . . . It\u2019s not that it\u2019s any less provocative, but it\u2019s done in a way where that person can shine and that person can open up and you get to know that person.\u201d\n\nAnd then Stern mentions, with pride, a sequence from just the day before. Comedian Tracy Morgan, one of his favorite guests, showed up for an interview. But only minutes before the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star walked into the studio, Stern had been interrogating Sal Governale, a staffer known for his willingness to participate in such on-air activities as the \u201cheaviest diaper contest.\u201d Stern pressed Governale about how he was treating a genital infection. During the chat, Governale casually unzipped his pants, in view of the cameras, to demonstrate his cleaning method.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve somehow gone through this metamorphosis where I\u2019m not intrigued by that,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThe fact that he put yogurt on his penis is just as interesting to me as ever.\u201d", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://hardwoodhoudini.com/2020/06/03/boston-celtics-free-agency-options/", "authors": ["Andrew Hughes", "Adam Wells", "Mark Nilon"], "title": "Boston Celtics: 2 realistic free agency options for Cs", "text": "The Boston Celtics will be strapped for cash this offseason and will likely look to the bargain bin in free agency to add more personnel to their rotation.\n\nAt 43-21, it\u2019s no secret that, leading up to the March 11th COVID-19 induced hiatus, the Boston Celtics were one of the best teams the league had to offer in 2019-20.\n\nBy the time of the suspension, the shamrocks found themselves placed in the third seed in the Eastern Conference, the fifth seed in the entire NBA, and, as of March 10th, found themselves clinching their sixth consecutive postseason berth.\n\nThanks in large to the impressive performances of All-Stars Kemba Walker and Jayson Tatum, arguable All-Star snub Jaylen Brown, former All-Star Gordon Hayward, and Swiss Army man Marcus Smart Boston was viewed as a legitimate contender to represent the east in this year\u2019s NBA Finals.\n\nHowever, though the aforementioned players managed to ball out for the most part of the season, it\u2019s not to say that Danny Ainge and co. won\u2019t try everything in their power to upgrade the rest of the roster surrounding this core come the offseason.\n\nFrom the backup point guard position to their center rotation \u2014 regardless of how solid Daniel Theis has been this year \u2014 the team needs to address many areas within their rotation that can legitimately be seen as \u201cweak\u201d if they truly want to better position themselves for a championship run.\n\nRELATED PRODUCT Tailgate Men's Boston Celtics Fleece Hoodie Green S Buy Now!

The state is not informed of how much vaccine to expect in subsequent weeks or months, which makes planning for the next phase of immunization \u2018very, very difficult,\u2019 Shah said.\n\nMaine reported 525 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday. There were three additional deaths.\n\nShah has said Maine would need to receive about 50,000 doses per week, instead of the 15,000 to 20,000 it has been getting, to avoid constraining the immunization program.\n\nFederal Operation Warp Speed officials have told the state it might receive an additional 100 doses of the Moderna vaccine on top of the 17,075 other doses next week, Shah said. The state so far is receiving vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer.\n\nSo far, 38,065 Mainers have received at least the first dose of the vaccine.

It has to be reality based,\u201d Shah said. \u201cThose (other states\u2019) plans are just words on a page without any promise behind them.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Shah said, state officials are in discussions about Phase 1B and are expected to release the plan in the coming weeks.\n\nOverall, Maine has recorded 27,090 cases of COVID-19 and 372 deaths since the pandemic began in March. The seven-day average of daily new cases stood at 513.9 on Wednesday, compared to 429.7 a week ago and 262.9 a month ago.\n\nCurrently, 191 people are hospitalized in Maine with COVID-19, with 54 in intensive care.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Central Maine Healthcare and Northern Light Health systems began administering second doses of vaccine to front-line medical workers who received first doses three weeks ago.

He said 10 to 15 percent of staff members have said they couldn\u2019t be vaccinated at this time, but very few have declined to be vaccinated at all.\n\nJarvis also noted a rise in patients canceling appointments for regular medical care because they fear being exposed to the virus if they enter Northern Light facilities.\n\n\u201cIt is safe to come into our facilities,\u201d Jarvis said. \u201cIf you delay care, it could be detrimental to your health.\u201d\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\u00ab Previous\n\nNext \u00bb\n\nfiled under:", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.sfgate.com/news/local/article/CDC-Coronavirus-virus-patient-released-in-San-15097374.php", "authors": ["Sig Christenson", "Staff Writer"], "title": "CDC: Coronavirus patient released in San Antonio later turned up positive", "text": "CDC: Coronavirus patient released in San Antonio later turned up positive\n\nIn this Feb 7, 2020 photo, people arrive from Wuhan, China, aboard a chartered Boeing 747 at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland.

Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nAs the details of Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s murder and the initial refusal of local authorities to prosecute his killers have come further to light this month, my thoughts have been turning more and more to my grandmother.\n\nAs a child of the Great Depression and the granddaughter of enslaved people, Wanda Crow was born into a family that survived the worst of America. My grandmother\u2019s stories of my family\u2019s survival in the midst of tribulation\u2014including one dating back the late 1800s, describing how my grandfather\u2019s uncle was nearly lynched by the KKK\u2014resonate even more whenever another modern American horror story like that of Arbery\u2019s death is made public.\n\nAnd though my great-uncle narrowly escaped, my grandmother still holds a recollection of stories of how her mother witnessed those who didn\u2019t\u2014throngs of mangled black bodies, hung by the dozen from oak trees in Arkansas.\n\nThese public, celebratory mutilations, which often targeted farmers and landowners, weren\u2019t simple executions. They were warnings\u2014threats of violent torture for any black person who sought equality, or worse, political power. These crimes also revealed the perpetrators\u2019 deep fear of their black neighbors\u2014a uniquely American fear that reduces innocent black people to criminals, so unworthy of life that their death is fit for a stage.\n\nWith the emergence of video footage of Arbery\u2019s killing this month, his murder has been correctly recast as a \u201cmodern lynching.\u201d As with similar tragedies of the recent past, it should force Americans to reckon with their country\u2019s dark past and the broken legal systems that allow such injustices to continue. In Arbery\u2019s case, his killers claimed the protection of a citizen\u2019s arrest statute that, if used as prosecutors originally envisioned, would be tantamount to allowing legalized lynching, and must be repealed.\n\nAs a reminder, here are some of the key details of the 25-year-old Arbery\u2019s death.\n\nOn Feb. 23, Arbery made his way down an ashen stretch of the Satilla Shores neighborhood\u2014a quiet suburb near downtown Brunswick, Georgia\u2014during a routine afternoon run. On his route, he ran past a former Glynn County police officer and detective, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34. The two men, who later claimed that they suspected that Arbery was involved in a recent string of break-ins in their neighborhood, proceeded to grab their guns, jump in their white pickup truck, and trail the former high school athlete for more than four minutes.\n\nAccording to one officer\u2019s interview with Gregory, which became the sole basis of the incident\u2019s initial police report, the McMichaels attempted a \u201ccitizen\u2019s arrest,\u201d which led to a vicious tussle as Arbery \u201cviolently attacked\u201d the father-and-son pair and \u201cstarted fighting over the shotgun, at which point Travis fired a shot and then a second later there was a second shot.\u201d On this basis, prosecutors declined to try the case and the McMichaels appeared to go scot free. Then, earlier this month, video of Arbery\u2019s death was made public. As in other recent similar incidents, such as the deaths of Eric Garner and Stephon Clark at the hands of police, the footage subverted the killers\u2019 claims in graphic detail.\n\nThat footage shows Arbery running around the perimeter of the McMichaels\u2019 vehicle, then grappling with Travis as his father, Gregory, stands in the truck bed like a sniper and fires off three shotgun shells\u2014two of which strike Arbery in the chest. Just two days after the video emerged, and thousands flooded social media with demands for the McMichaels\u2019 arrest, the two men were charged with murder and aggravated assault. It took nearly two full months, though, for Arbery\u2019s killers to face arrest after they cited the \u201ccitizen\u2019s arrest\u201d statute.\n\nIn addition to the initial resistance of the district attorney to hear the pleas of Arbery\u2019s family, the case involved a revolving door of prosecutors\u2014two of whom had previous ties with the McMichaels that led to consecutive recusals\u2014as well as conflicting accounts about the potential involvement in the McMichaels\u2019 pursuit of the man who filmed the video.\n\nSuch concerns have led activists across the state, like Georgia NAACP President James Woodall, to call for an investigation of the initial inquiry. Woodall told me that the local NAACP has also called for the immediate resignation of Brunswick district attorney Jackie Johnson for not issuing an arrest warrant following Arbery\u2019s death, a revision to the state\u2019s use of force statute (the training for which Gregory was penalized for skipping when he was previously on the job), and a complete repeal of the citizen\u2019s arrest statute in Georgia. As the local NAACP has sought justice for Arbery, it has taken particular aim at fighting citizen\u2019s arrest. As Woodall described it, the law has a deep history going back to the era of slavery and was \u201coriginally used to help white slave owners to catch and return enslaved people attempting to escape North.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no accident that such a law was used to try to justify Arbery\u2019s killing. \u201cWe have two decades of research to show that state laws which protect individuals for aggressively protecting their property, like the citizen\u2019s arrest laws, are often used as cover for an increase in racially-biased violence,\u201d New School professor Maya Wiley told me. Wiley, who served as the chair of the New York Civilian Complaint Review Board following Garner\u2019s death, pointed out that white people are also less safe as a result of laws that encourage vigilantism, which have proved to increase homicide rates and emergency room visits across racial groups. The rendering of Arbery\u2019s death as a lynching\u2014as described by a range of local and national leaders from the mayor of Atlanta to Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden\u2014makes sense, Wiley notes, because the killing follows a familiar formula that includes the presumption of guilt placed on an innocent black victim by the killers.\n\nThat presumption of guilt, which was given official credence thanks to the citizen\u2019s arrest statute, extended to the views of local authorities as well. In a letter to the police, George E. Barnhill\u2014the second prosecutor on Arbery\u2019s case who has since recused himself because his son had previously worked with Gregory McMichael\u2014cited Arbery\u2019s engagement with law enforcement as a teenager to \u201chelp explain his apparent aggressive nature and his possible thought pattern to attack an armed man.\u201d\n\nThe depiction of blameless black men like Arbery as aggressors and criminals isn\u2019t just reinforced in popular culture; it\u2019s demonstrated in research, including a recent series of studies by the American Psychological Association, which showed that people have a \u201ctendency to perceive black men as larger and more threatening than similarly sized white men.\u201d And for black men and boys, such damning racial casting begins at a terrifyingly early age. (One need only look at the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice to see this fact.) A separate study from the APA found that black boys as young as 10 years old were \u201cmore likely to be mistaken as older, be perceived as guilty and face police violence if accused of a crime.\u201d\n\nThis presumption of guilt\u2014with its continued use to justify laws like Georgia\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest statute\u2014is the same that contributed to countless lynchings throughout American history. Today, that inescapable comparison is why Arbery\u2019s death has left black people afraid to jog, or why Jordan Davis\u2019 death has made us afraid to play music loudly, or why Stephon Clark\u2019s death has made us afraid to carry cellphones, and more recently, why the death of Breonna Taylor, who was shot eight times in March as Louisville, Kentucky, police raided the wrong home in the middle of the night, has even made us afraid to go to bed at night.\n\nAs long as black lives are threatened by such violence, there is no way for laws like Georgia\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest statute to remain on the books without being used to justify that violence. If we learn anything from Arbery\u2019s killing, it\u2019s that repealing such laws is the best possible way to prevent deaths like his in the future\u2014and better protect people from the dangers of living while black in America.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8451285/8-7-million-Americans-infected-coronavirus-MARCH-80-never-diagnosed.html", "authors": ["Mary Kekatos Senior", "Mary Kekatos Senior Health Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "title": "8.7 million Americans may have been infected with coronavirus in MARCH, but 80% were never diagnosed", "text": "Millions of Americans may have contracted the novel coronavirus at the outset of the pandemic, but the majority were never diagnosed, a new study suggests.\n\nResearchers from Penn State University found that as many as 8.7 million people were infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, in the US in March.\n\nHowever, more than three-quarters of them - 80 percent - were never confirmed to have the virus due to limited test availability and asymptomatic people who never sought medical care.\n\nResearchers saw a surge of influenza-like illnesses across the US (above).

The ID NOW has generated widespread excitement because it can produce results in less than 15 minutes.\n\nBut the ID NOW only detected the virus in 85.2% of the samples, meaning it had a false-negative rate of 14.8 percent, according to Dr. Gary Procop, who heads COVID-19 testing at the Cleveland Clinic and led the study.\n\n\"So that means if you had 100 patients that were positive, 15% of those patients would be falsely called negative. They'd be told that they're negative for COVID when they're really positive,\" Procop told NPR in an interview. \"That's not too good.\"\n\nProcop says a test should be at least 95% reliable.\n\nProcop, who plans to publish the study soon, chairs the Commission of Science, Technology and Policy for the American Society for Clinical Pathology.\n\nAlthough the paper has not yet gone through the traditional peer-review process, Procop says the findings have been carefully reviewed at his hospital and he is confident in the results.\n\nIn a statement, Abbott defended the test's reliability.\n\n\"ID NOW performs as expected and we have confidence in the performance of the test,\" the statement said.\n\nAbbott said any problems with the test could stem from samples being stored in a special solution known as viral transport media before being tested, instead of being inserted directly into the ID NOW testing machine. As a result, the company recently instructed all users to only test samples put directly into the machines.\n\n\"When a direct swab is used, the test is performing as expected,\" according to the company statement.\n\nAbbott did not provide a scientist to discuss Procop's study, but instead referred NPR to a doctor in private practice using the machines.\n\n\"We feel that the test is very accurate because we're using it the way it's supposed to be used\" by placing samples directly into the machine, said Dr. Warren Wollin, senior medical director at Physicians Immediate Care, which operates urgent care clinics in Illinois.\n\n\"So many patients come in and have so much anxiety because they have minor symptoms. And to be able to tell them right away gives them such relief,\" Wollin said.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic's Procop acknowledged that all of the samples in his study were stored in viral transport media before being tested. But Procop argues the company should back up its claim with data that this could affect the test's accuracy, especially if the test is being used in settings where people may not be aware of possible false negatives.\n\n\"They need to prove to us that they can actually deliver a sensitivity greater than 95% [if samples are placed directly in the machine], or else we'll be putting citizens at risk,\" Procop says.\n\nBased on his study, Procop said his hospital has stopped using the test to screen patients being admitted for care. The hospital also stopped using another test, called the DiaSorin Simplexa, because it only detected 89.3% of infections in his study, Procop said.\n\n\"If you have patients coming into hospital and you're going to put them into what has been determined to be a COVID-free ward, you have to have the most sensitive test available,\" Procop says. \"Because once you put somebody with COVID into a COVID-free ward, it's no longer a COVID-free any more. It's your new COVID ward.\"\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic plans to rely on other tests that performed better in the study, Procop said. That includes the test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which detected 100% of positive samples. Another test made by Roche detected 96.5% of positive samples. The fifth test in the study, made by Cepheid, detected 98.2% of infected samples, Procop said. The Cepheid test produces results in less than an hour.\n\nAbbott is shipping 50,000 coronavirus tests every day for use on 18,000 ID NOW testing machines in doctors' offices, clinics and hospitals around the country. The company hopes to boost that to at least 2 million every month by June.\n\nStill Procop, like Wollin, believes the Abbott test can be useful in many settings, especially when results are needed urgently and as long as doctors advise patients about the potential false negatives. And patients, indeed everyone, still need to be counselled to continue taking precautions to avoid infecting other people, he says.\n\n\"It is a risk that if you tell somebody they're negative and they're truly positive that they will relax social distancing, not wear a face mask etc. and could transmit the disease,\" Procop says.\n\n\"If you get back a negative test and think, 'I don't have it and I can go to a mixer,' \" Procop says. \"And now everybody at the mixer has now been exposed to you.\"\n\nOthers agree.\n\n\"A high rate of false negatives would definitely be cause for concern,\" says Dr. Thomas Inglesby, who runs the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\n\n\"If that happens, then they wouldn't be told to isolate themselves, public health wouldn't seek out or quarantine their close contacts, doctors wouldn't know what illness they have. Their family members wouldn't know to protect themselves,\" Inglesby wrote in an email.\n\nOther researchers noted that all tests can produce false-negative results, especially if the samples are not collected properly or at a time when a patient doesn't have readily detectable levels of virus in their bodies.\n\n\"All of the tests do miss a number of patients --anywhere from 5 to 30 percent,\" says Dr. Alan Wells, a professor of pathology at the University of Pittsburgh. \"So this is not unique to ID NOW.\"\n\nAnd just because someone tests negative one day, doesn't mean they might not get infected the next day.\n\n\"So regardless of whether it's ID NOW or other tests, we recognize that we can not say with any assuredness that you are safe or not,\" Wells says.\n\nBut Wells added that \"the ID NOW test seems not to be as effective as\" other tests, based on his own research.\n\nIn Wells' study involving specimens from 50 patients, the ID NOW missed more infections than three other tests, especially in samples containing the lowest levels of virus, Wells says.\n\n\"The ID NOW missed roughly about half those patients,\" Wells told NPR in an interview.\n\n\"We do not use ID NOW to rule out a diagnosis of COVID disease, based on the limits of it not picking up as many patients as other platforms that we have,\" Wells said. \"Our use of ID NOW is put on hold.\"\n\nWells also doubts the false-negatives are due to the specimens being diluted by being stored in fluid first.\n\n\"It's not due to the dilution,\" Wells told NPR in an interview. \"Our evidence is that this is not the sole cause of the lower effectiveness of the ID NOW.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/world/asia/coronavirus-quarantines-history.html", "authors": ["Michael Levenson"], "title": "Scale of China\u2019s Wuhan Shutdown Is Believed to Be Without Precedent", "text": "The practice of isolating people and goods to halt the spread of disease dates at least to the 14th century, when ships arriving in Venice during the plague epidemic were required to anchor off the coast for 40 days.

The order led to deadly clashes with soldiers and may have helped to spread the disease, experts said, forcing people to crowd together for basic humanitarian aid.\n\nDuring the SARS outbreak of 2003, Canadian health officials asked anyone in Ontario who had even one symptom of the respiratory infection to stay home for a few days out of fear that the disease might spread during the Easter holiday weekend.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ted-cruz-sherrod-brown-senator-wear-mask/", "authors": ["Caitlin O'Kane", "Caitlin O'Kane Is A Digital Content Producer Covering Trending Stories For Cbs News", "Its Good News Brand", "The Uplift."], "title": "Ted Cruz calls Sherrod Brown \"a complete ass\" for asking another senator to wear a mask on the Senate floor", "text": "A viral clip from the Senate floor on Monday shows Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, and Alaskan Republican Senator Dan Sullivan briefly arguing over masks.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz retweeted the video writing: \"This is idiotic. @SherrodBrown is being a complete ass.

Only the senators matter, right?\" historian Kevin Kruse replied to Cruz's tweet.\n\n\"Isn't there a woman standing a couple feet away from him in the video you tweeted,\" wrote Talking Points Memo founder Josh Marshall.\n\nBrown tweeted video his original exchange with Sullivan, writing: \"Once again, I asked my Republican colleagues to stop endangering all the Senate workers - and simply wear a mask when presiding over the Senate. Once again, they refused.\"\n\nCBS News has reached out to the offices of Brown, Sullivan and Cruz for comment.\n\nIn many states and cities, masks are required in most indoor spaces \u2013 like gyms, stores and museums. Wearing a mask around other people is considered an effective way to slow the transmission of coronavirus.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends all people over the age of two should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don't live in their household.\n\nThe CDC notes that while masks may not be necessary when you are outside, by yourself and away from others, some localities may have mask mandates while out in public, which should be followed.\n\nIn July, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi mandated face masks in the U.S. House of Representatives. However, mask guidance varies depending on location \u2013 not just in the nation, but in Congress. Masks are only recommended in the Senate \u2013 not mandatory \u2013 according to The Washington Post.\n\nOn Tuesday, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, who at 87 is the second oldest member of the Senate, said in a statement that he had tested positive for the coronavirus. Alaska Congressman Don Young, who is also 87, tested positive for COVID-19 last week. The two congressmen are just two of the lawmakers who have recently tested positive for the virus.\n\nLast month, Republican Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Mike Lee of Utah tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nTheir positive test results came just hours after it was revealed President Trump and first lady Melania Trump had contracted COVID-19. Several White House staffers subsequently tested positive after attending a \"superspreader\" event \u2013 the nomination ceremony for Amy Coney Barrett, which was held outdoors but where many people did not wear masks.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Tue Nov 17 03:57:20 +0000 2020", "id": 1328547744584183809, "id_str": "1328547744584183809", "full_text": "This is idiotic. @SherrodBrown is being a complete ass.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration\n\nDecember 20, 2020\n\nBy David Shepardson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. lawmakers are expected to endorse $1.9 billion to fund a program to remove telecom network equipment that the U.S. government says poses national security risks as part of a year-end spending bill and COVID-19 bill, a source briefed on the matter said on Sunday.\n\nLawmakers are also expected to back $3.2 billion for an emergency broadband benefit for low-income Americans.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission said in June it had formally designated China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp as threats, a declaration that bars U.S. firms from tapping an $8.3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from the companies.\n\nEarlier this month, the FCC finalized rules that require carriers with ZTE or Huawei equipment to \u201crip and replace\u201d that equipment but is awaiting funding from Congress.\n\nHuawei said earlier this month it was disappointed in the FCC\u2019s decision \u201cto force removal of our products from telecommunications networks. This overreach puts U.S. citizens at risk in the largely underserved rural areas \u2013 during a pandemic \u2013 when reliable communication is essential.\u201d\n\nThe bill \u201cestablishes a temporary, emergency broadband benefit program at the FCC to help low-income Americans, including those economically challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, get connected or remain connected to broadband,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe source also said the program will supply a $50 monthly subsidy to qualifying households \u201cto help them afford broadband service and an internet-connected device.\u201d\n\nThe $7 billion COVID Relief Broadband Package also expands eligibility for the rip-and-replace reimbursement program to communications providers with 10 million subscribers or less but prioritizes reimbursement for providers with 2 million subscribers or less, the source said, citing a draft fact sheet.\n\nThe bill is expected to include $285 million for connecting minority communities and will establish an Office of Minority Broadband Initiatives at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).\n\nIt will also offer funding to \u201csupport minority-serving education institutions, including when they partner with minority-owned businesses, to expand broadband capacity and use at the school and in the surrounding community.\u201d\n\nIt also includes about $250 million for additional FCC support for telehealth and $1 billion for a NTIA tribal broadband connectivity grant program.\n\nThere is a separate $300 million NTIA grant program to promote broadband expansion to underserved Americans, especially in rural areas, and $65 Million for better broadband maps.\n\nThat fully funds the FCC\u2019s development of new more accurate broadband availability maps to help the agency better target government funding for broadband deployment.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Sonya Hepinstall)", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/08/middleeast/middle-east-travel-warnings/index.html", "authors": ["Tamara Hardingham-Gill", "Karla Cripps"], "title": "Safety warning for tourists heading to Middle East", "text": "(CNN) Rising tensions in the Middle East have prompted international safety warnings for tourists and other travelers heading to prime tourism destinations such as United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Turkey.\n\nParticularly dire consequences could face Westerners, some experts have warned, as anti-American sentiments escalate following last week's US drone strike on Iraq that killed a top Iranian general.\n\nMany travelers preparing to visit the region now face hard choices over whether to cancel their trips.\n\nThe US State Department and British Foreign Commonwealth Office (FCO) are among the many government bodies to issue \"do not travel\" advisories for both Iraq and Iran -- unsurprisingly given the current situation.\n\nBut destinations previously known as safe tourist havens are now also the subject of official warnings highlighting the risk of violence and potential \"terrorist attacks.\" One expert said there was a real risk that visits to unsecured heritage sites could turn deadly.\n\nOver the last few days, the United States, Canada and the UK have also issued updated security advice or alerts concerning the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\n\"The U.S. Embassy/Consulate General in the UAE advises all U.S. citizens of heightened tensions in the region,\" says one alert. \"U.S. citizens are strongly encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance and practice good situational awareness.\"\n\nThe FCO, meanwhile, updated its Turkey travel advice on January 7 , advising against all travel to areas within 10 kilometers of the border with Syria, except the city of Kilis, due to Turkish military operations in northeastern Syria.\n\n\"Following the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a US strike in Baghdad on 3 January, the incident has led to increased tensions in the region,\" says the FCO's advisory.\n\n\"There is a possibility of an increased threat against Western interests and the security situation could worsen with little warning. You should remain vigilant and keep up to date with the latest developments, including via the media.\"\n\nGuidance on travel to the UAE, which receives around 1.5 million British tourists each year, has been updated with a similar warning, stressing that while most visits are \"trouble free\" the \"increased threat against Western interests\" suggests that \"terrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in the UAE.\"\n\nOn January 4, Canada updated security advice for multiple destinations in the region due to an increased threat of attacks.\n\nCitizens are now advised to exercise a high degree of caution in Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"The decision to travel is your choice and you are responsible for your personal safety abroad,\" reads a message on the Government of Canada website.\n\n\"We take the safety and security of Canadians abroad very seriously and provide credible and timely information in our Travel Advice to enable you to make well-informed decisions regarding your travel abroad.\"\n\nAre flights to the region still in operation?\n\nSome international airlines have canceled or rerouted flights to avoid airspace above Iran and Iraq. Passengers with travel plans in the region should check with their airline for flight updates.\n\nThe US Federal Aviation Administration restricted commercial US flights \"from operating in the airspace over Iraq, Iran, and the waters of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.\"\n\nA Boeing 737 jet, operated by Ukraine International Airlines, crashed on Wednesday shortly after takeoff from Tehran's international airport. The cause of the crash has not been determined.\n\nCan I cancel my trip?\n\nWhile governments have warned against all non-essential travel to Iraq and Iran, this doesn't apply to surrounding countries, which means travelers currently have no legal right to cancel or amend travel plans with a guaranteed refund.\n\n\"The travel advisory warnings are quite 'soft',\" says Yeganeh Morakabati, an expert in risk and tourism at the UK's Bournemouth University.\n\n\"This puts people in the difficult position of having to either lose their money or put their lives in danger.\"\n\nHow concerned should travelers be?\n\nTravel risk, crisis management and evacuation company Global Rescue admit there's a \"high degree of uncertainty\" at present, stressing the next few days will be critical when it comes to assessing how the situation will play out.\n\n\"Anytime countries like Iran and the US are standing toe to toe and launching attacks at each other isn't a great time to be in the airspace,\" Daniel L. Richards, the company's CEO, tells CNN Travel.\n\n\"The story is obviously still unfolding. This thing could stabilize relatively quickly, or it may not.\n\n\"It's very hard to say whether or not traveling to the Middle East or throughout the Middle East is something that anybody should be doing right now if they don't have to do.\"\n\n\"If you have a really good reason to go to the Middle East, I don't think you shouldn't.\n\n\"But you'll be going into a theater where there are active hostilities between two very significant players, so you have to be prepared for entering that type of environment.\"\n\nRichards advises that anyone planning to travel to the region imminently make sure they communicate their whereabouts to those close to them and be prepared to move quickly.\n\nHe also recommends bringing along a reliable means of communication in case cell phone networks go down.\n\n\"People are nervous,\" he adds. \"We're hearing from a lot of our members who are either in the region or had plans to travel to the region.\n\n\"We're definitely in a position where we're ready to act on behalf for our members and our clients in the region, should we have to.\"\n\nMorakabati also stresses that anyone planning to travel to the Middle East in the coming days or weeks should be extremely vigilant.\n\n\"If I was a white American going to the Middle East, I would think twice,\" she says.\n\n\"It's not just Iran, Iraq or Lebanon. The anti-American sentiment is quite strong everywhere at the moment. This is clear when you read the local media.\"\n\nMorakabati advises any tourists visiting the region to avoid any particularly busy or central areas.\n\n\"Some of the heritage places are very difficult to control in terms of security,\" she adds.\n\n\"I would say, don't go to many of these places. It might be the case that you've paid $5,000, but sometimes you trade $5,000 for your life.\"\n\nHow will this impact tourism in the Middle East?\n\nWhile travel to the region remains active, the current level of uncertainty could ultimately have a bearing on the tourism industries of various Middle Eastern countries and/or territories.\n\nThe UAE welcomes more than 21 million tourists annually and the popular destination recently announced a multiple-entry tourist visa scheme for all nationalities in a bid to attract even more visitors.\n\nTurkey generated around $34 billion of tourism revenues in 2019, while capital city Istanbul was named one of the world's most visited destinations in UK-based market research company Euromonitor's International Top 100 City Destinations 2019 report.\n\nTourism in Jordan has also been booming and the Arab nation registered a 9.4% increase in tourism revenue last year.\n\n\"Of course it [the Iran-US crisis] will affect tourism,\" says Morakabati. \"But the bigger picture is, it will also impact the prospect of foreign direct investment.\n\n\"Jordan has always been in a difficult position, although it's a very attractive destination. It's very hard to control attacks in that part of the world.\n\n\"Turkey has always been difficult in terms of security -- there have been several terrorist attacks there.\n\n\"These destinations have a lot more to lose than Iran, because the Iranians have lost so much already, that in a way, there isn't anything much left to lose. Most of the tourism arrivals there will be those who are visiting relatives.\n\n\"I'd say Turkey and Jordan are among the most at risk, because they are in a tough geographical position.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/rep-adam-kinzinger-us-iran-trump-force-respond", "authors": ["Adam Kinzinger", "Adam Kinzinger Was First Sworn Into The U.

People are terrified that the recent rising tensions with Iran will result in World War III. The conspiracy theories do what they always do and blame America first. This doubt in the capabilities of our military and the internal divisions over the role America plays on the world stage is deeply disappointing.\n\nIran has crossed a line with their latest attack on the United States over international airspace, and it\u2019s time we let the regime know that these egregiously misguided actions have very real consequences.\n\nSome have speculated that the escalations with Iran are a direct result of President Trump\u2019s decision to leave the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran, which was agreed upon by the Obama administration. The so-called Iran Deal of 2015 was a terrible agreement for the United States, and a treasure trove for the corrupt Iranian regime to grow in wealth and feel an emboldened sense of power to threaten our national security.\n\nUS CALLED OFF RETALIATORY STRIKE AGAINST IRAN IN LAST MINUTE: SOURCE\n\nI fully supported the decision to leave the JCPOA and urged the Trump administration to deliver a comprehensive plan to hold Iran accountable, protect our own national security, and firmly restrict Iran\u2019s ballistic missile weapons and nuclear program.\n\nIn the year that\u2019s passed, Iran has been significantly weakened \u2013 from a shrinking economy to falling oil production. This downturn for Iran has clearly left the regime angry and desperate, as made evident by the series of provocations and lashing out against the United States, and our interests. But let\u2019s remember, this is just the latest chapter in our 40-year history of Iran\u2019s attacks on the United States and our allies.\n\nIran is the world\u2019s largest state-sponsor of terrorism, with proxies operating on their behalf in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and many others even in our own hemisphere. Without question, the Iranian regime continues to target the U.S. and our allies and has done so for decades.\n\nA significant number of American troops were killed in the Iraq War directly because of Iran. A recent Pentagon report confirmed that at least 603 U.S. troops were killed in Iraq from 2003 until 2011 because of Iran-backed militants, Iranian-made IEDs, and other improvised rockets funded by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) \u2013 Iran\u2019s military force.\n\nSince then, Iranian-backed militias have significantly expanded in Iraq, intentionally attacking U.S. forces and targeting innocent Iraqi civilians. Their true intentions are blatant, and yet, the United States has shown incredible restraint through it all.\n\nBut now, Iran has crossed a line.\n\nWe have the ability to execute a proportional response without leading American troops to war. The U.S. could start by taking out surface-to-air missile sites, and let Iran know that we are not playing around.\n\nThe provocations by Iran are aimed at sowing chaos, both here in the U.S. and around the world. The Iranian regime took a diplomatic issue over sanctions and nuclear arsenal and responded with military actions. They felt the pressures and lashed out, and it\u2019s time the United States show Iran that their dangerous games will not be tolerated any longer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe U.S. military can end this desperate escalation by Iran pretty quickly, and while that\u2019s not what we want to do, the military option must remain on the table. I certainly hope the military operation scheduled in retaliation was not called off because of a change in mind, but rather because of a tactical need. In 2013, then-President Obama notoriously canceled a strike on Syria and the ramifications from that decision are still being felt.\n\nIt\u2019s time the people of this country remember the strength of our military and the freedoms we enjoy \u2013 freedoms and interests that are worth protecting and standing up to defend.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY REP.

Eli Lilly's trial of its antibody treatment, combined with remdesivir, to treat hospitalized was also paused on October 13.\n\nRegulators say that trial pauses are to be expected, even characterizing them as encouraging signs that the process of testing drugs is and vaccines is working as it should be flagging safety concerns ahead of approvals.\n\nNonetheless it's a blow to President Trump, who has been pushing for the approval of therapeutics to be approved by Election Day since changes to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) requirements for authorizing coronavirus vaccines thwarted his hopes of having a vaccine by November 3.\n\nTrials for Regeneron's coronavirus antibody drug (pictured) to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been paused over a 'potential safety concern,' the firm said Friday (file)\n\nRegeneron said Friday that independent monitors had recommended placing on hold enrollment of the most severely ill patients - those who need intense oxygen treatment or breathing machines - because of a potential safety problem and unfavorable balance of risks and benefits.\n\nNeither the company nor its safety monitors have offered any specifics on the nature of the 'safety concern.'\n\nThe study can continue to test the two-antibody drug combo in hospitalized patients who need little or no extra oxygen, the monitors said. Other studies in mild or moderately ill people also are continuing.\n\nAntibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated.\n\nBut it can take several weeks for the most effective ones to form. The experimental drugs aim to help immediately, by supplying concentrated versions of one or two antibodies that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.\n\nEarlier this month, a different group of monitors recommended pausing enrollment in a U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) study testing an Eli Lilly antibody drug to investigate a possible safety issue in hospitalized patients.\n\nOn Monday, the NIH said no safety problem had been verified, but they stopped the study because the drug didn't seem to work in that situation.\n\n'These kinds of results are informing us about the timing of the benefit,' said Dr. Myron Cohen, a University of North Carolina virologist who advises the government on COVID-19 treatments.\n\nTests in animals suggest that antibody drugs work best when given early in infection to lower the amount of virus, he said. Once someone is very sick, the drugs may not help, but it's too soon to know if that's the case, he said.\n\nDoctors already know that timing can matter when it comes to COVID-19 treatments.\n\nStudies suggest that dexamethasone and other steroids can lower the risk of death when given to very sick patients to tamp down an over-active immune system, but they may be harmful for those who are only mildly ill.\n\nLilly and Regeneron have asked the Food and Drug Administration to allow emergency use of their experimental antibody drugs for mild and moderately ill patients who don\u00b4t need hospitalization.\n\nRegeneron said it would share Friday's advice from independent monitors with the FDA and leaders of a separate study in the United Kingdom testing its drug in hospitalized patients.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/business/huawei-donald-trump.html", "authors": ["Jim Tankersley", "Ana Swanson"], "title": "Trump Administration Will Allow Some Companies to Sell to Huawei", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is following through with plans to allow American companies to continue doing business with Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment giant, just weeks after placing the company on a Commerce Department blacklist.\n\nOn Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the administration will issue licenses for American companies that want to do business with Huawei \u201cwhere there is no threat to national security.\u201d And another top official suggested the move would allow chip makers to continue selling certain technology to Huawei.\n\nThe comments confirm President Trump\u2019s surprise announcement last month, after a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, that the United States would relax restrictions on Huawei as part of an effort to restart stalled trade talks with China.

Quick, somebody alert the media.\n\nThe Washington press corps is covering one of the largest, continuing stories in recent history the same way it has covered the Trump administration since Day One.\n\nThe formula is simple: Whatever the president does is not just wrong, it\u2019s borderline evil. Details at 11.\n\nIn the real world, events are unfolding at a pace and scale impossible to comprehend. But at too many news outlets, the aim is not to inform. It\u2019s to render the harshest possible judgment on the man journalists love to hate.\n\nAlready The New York Times has twice called the White House response \u201ccalamitous,\u201d including once in a supposedly straight-news article.\n\nThis is beyond shameful. When antagonists like Sen. Chuck Schumer finally are working with Trump and when the Democratic governors of New York and California swap praise with the president over their partnerships, the media ought to take a hint that this time is different and there is no place for biased journalism-as-usual.\n\nInstead, after failing to bring down Trump with Russia, Russia, Russia and impeachment, they\u2019re now putting their chips on the narrative that he\u2019s bungling the public health crisis.\n\nTo get there, they\u2019ve had to reverse themselves on a key allegation. For three years the same media told us Trump was a fascist and a budding Hitler, but now his refusal to rule with an iron fist is also cause for condemnation.\n\nSuddenly, the man whose \u201cAuthoritarian style is remaking America\u201d (Washington Post), and whose \u201cAuthoritarian Ambitions\u201d were exposed by impeachment (New York magazine), foolishly refuses to use the powers of the Oval Office. As usual, other countries are doing it right and America is wrong.\n\nWhen Trump advised people to stop unnecessary travel and avoid bars, restaurants and groups of more than 10, a Times headline moaned that the \u201cGuidelines Fall Short of the Mandates in Other Countries.\u201d\n\nThe Gray Lady\u2019s latest complaints involve the Defense Protection Act, which gives the president the authority to commandeer private industry. But he\u2019s a lousy authoritarian because, as the Times put it Friday, \u201cTrump Resists Pressure to Force Companies to Make Coronavirus Supplies.\u201d\n\nBehind every complaint is a roster of anonymous sources and Obama administration grousers.\n\nMeanwhile, because of its one-track agenda, the media are missing one of the biggest stories \u2014 the sense of unity against the epidemic being forged across America.\n\nEven Dem presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders largely slipped out of sight, a welcome sign that they realize now is not the time to try to score political points.\n\nAnd the public, despite the media, gets it that the president is doing his best against an unprecedented and invisible enemy. Polls reflect a belief that, after a slow start, Trump is mobilizing an enormous national response involving both the public and private sectors and is committed to victory.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos survey released Friday finds 55 percent approve of the president\u2019s leadership, while 43 percent disapprove. Those figures are a reversal from a week earlier, when 43 percent approved and 54 percent disapproved.\n\nOf course, to recognize this shift in the national mood would mean the media would have to give Trump credit, and that is forbidden. Stark polarization is what the media like and want \u2014 and refuse to see anything else.\n\nTellingly, the more information and access Trump gives the White House press corps, the angrier the members get. The president and his team provide daily updates, announce new efforts and take numerous questions.\n\nWhile many of the questions try to flesh out details, virtually every day there is also an obvious \u201cGotcha\u201d effort. Frustrated by Trump\u2019s refusal to surrender to their superior intelligence, his inquisitors, graduates of the Jim Acosta school of journalism, end up berating and arguing with him.\n\nOne day there were repeated assertions thinly disguised as questions about why the president continues to call the virus the \u201cChinese virus.\u201d Doesn\u2019t he realize that\u2019s racist?\n\nHis answers were to the point: \u201cThat\u2019s where it came from\u201d and \u201cEverybody knows it came from China.\u201d\n\nAs some commentators noted, the questions parroted a talking point of the Chinese Communist Party. That makes this a case of Trump Derangement Syndrome with a coronavirus twist.\n\nIt\u2019s also a clear case of China trying to meddle in our elections. Once upon a time, the media cared about that.\n\nFriday\u2019s briefing featured Trump scolding NBC reporter Peter Alexander, with others in the room defending Alexander.\n\nThe sequence was revealing, with Alexander firing off questions faster than Trump could answer. Alexander first tried to drive a wedge between the president and Dr. Anthony Fauci, suggesting they were at odds over whether new treatment drugs could represent a breakthrough.\n\nsee also Criticisms of Trump's coronavirus response are sickening Whom better to have as president during the coronavirus epidemic...\n\nAs Trump downplayed any differences, Alexander fired an insult posing as a question, saying, \u201cIs it possible that your impulse to put a positive spin on things may be giving Americans a false sense of hope?\u201d\n\nAgain, Trump answered, saying \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so,\u201d only to be interrupted with another Alexander question. Alexander finally let Trump answer, then changed course again, asking \u201cSo, what do you say to Americans who are scared, I guess? Nearly 200 dead and 14,000 who are sick and millions as you witness who are scared right now, what do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?\u201d\n\nTrump finally had enough, saying \u201cyou are a terrible reporter, that\u2019s what I say. I think it\u2019s a very nasty question. I think it\u2019s a very bad signal that you are putting out to the American people. They\u2019re looking for answers and they\u2019re looking for hope. And you\u2019re doing sensationalism . . .\u201d\n\nNaturally, that became a big story for CNN and the other usual suspects. Mission accomplished.\n\nThere is much talk that the coronavirus epidemic will permanently alter aspects of American life. Let us hope that a new and improved journalism is among the changes.\n\nPutz\u2019s cheap shots\n\nReader Robert Pilgrim is among those panning the performance of Mayor Bill de Blasio.

The second one probably will be too: Moderna\u2019s vaccine is up for consideration this week. We\u2019ve never had an mRNA vaccine in common use before, so you\u2019re not alone if you\u2019re wondering what the hell this technology is, and whether it has something to do with DNA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo answer the most common questions: no, it doesn\u2019t change your DNA. No, it\u2019s not an unproven technology (it\u2019s actually been in the works for decades). And the CDC has a fact sheet here with the basics you need to know about the new technology.\n\nBut here\u2019s the very short version: the mRNA in the vaccine contains instructions to tell our body how to build a coronavirus spike protein. As soon as we do that, our immune system freaks out, as it\u2019s supposed to, and creates antibodies to the spike protein. The mRNA is destroyed shortly after the injection, but the antibodies stick around. They can then recognize the real virus if we ever encounter it in the wild.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWant the longer, more detailed version? Here we go.\n\nOur cells contain DNA and are continually making mRNA\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s start with a quick refresher on what it means to have genetic material. The DNA that we have, as humans, is contained in (almost) every cell of our body. It includes instructions for everything a cell might have to do. Processing food, growing more cells, releasing hormones\u2014anything that happens in your body happens because your cells are following recipes encoded in your DNA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEvery time our cells use one of those recipes, the information in the DNA needs to be copied first. That copy, instead of being another piece of DNA, is a slightly different type of molecule called RNA. (It\u2019s sort of like if DNA were a collection of reference books in a library. You can\u2019t check the book out, since it needs to stay in the library, but you can write down the information you want in a notebook, and take that with you. The notebook paper is RNA.)\n\nCopying DNA to make RNA is a process called transcription, and the next step is often translation: using the RNA instructions, now called mRNA, to make a protein. Proteins form much of the structure of our bodies, and little machines made of proteins perform nearly all our bodily functions. We are constantly making mRNAs and using these mRNAs to make proteins. All the time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe \u201cm\u201d in mRNA means \u201cmessenger,\u201d and it refers to the type of RNA we\u2019re talking about here, the ones that carry information from DNA to the protein-making machinery. (There are many other RNAs in the world, but let\u2019s not get too off track.)\n\nThe wild coronavirus contains RNA instructions to build itself\n\nBefore we talk about the vaccine, let\u2019s look at how the virus that causes COVID, SARS-CoV-2, works in the wild. Viruses are smaller and simpler than any of our cells, and many scientists will argue that they aren\u2019t \u201calive\u201d in the same way that people or even bacteria are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA virus is made of proteins, sometimes encased in a lipid (fatty) envelope. The proteins themselves make up the spiky ball shape of the coronavirus. The red nubs on that iconic illustration you\u2019ve seen are the spike proteins, but more about them later. There are 28 other proteins that form the rest of the virus.\n\nIllustration : SPQR10 , Wikimedia Commons, CC-BY-SA ( Other\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd inside that spiky ball? There is a single, long strand of RNA. This RNA is the virus\u2019s genome, and it contains instructions to build all 29 of the proteins in the virus itself.\n\nWhen the virus infects our cells, our own protein-making machinery translates the viral RNA and makes the proteins it calls for. We\u2019ve been tricked; we just made a bunch of virus parts. Those parts assemble into new viruses, each with their 29 proteins and a fresh copy of their RNA, and then they\u2019re off into the world to infect more cells.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Again, I\u2019m giving you a very streamlined summary of what happens; this paper from Nature describes the coronavirus life cycle in all its nerdy detail.)\n\nmRNA vaccines give our cells instructions to build the spike protein\n\nA traditional vaccine would include at least one protein from the virus or bacterium it\u2019s targeting, possibly an entire virus that has been inactivated or weakened so that it can\u2019t replicate. But an mRNA vaccine does things differently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis vaccine gives us no proteins at all, just a little lipid bubble (similar to the micelles in micellar water, the makeup cleanser) encasing an RNA with instructions on how to make the spike protein. These instructions are even formatted as a nice human-style mRNA, instead of the special tricky structure of viral RNA.\n\nWith these instructions, our cells can then make the spike protein (a bunch of those red nubs), but that\u2019s it. The other 28 proteins are absent. So we won\u2019t accidentally make any viruses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur immune system can then respond to the spike protein\n\nAfter making the spike protein, cells can put the spike proteins on their outsides, where immune system cells can interact with them. Our immune system recognizes the spike proteins as foreign and not part of ourselves, and it mounts an immune response against them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe immune response may include soreness, fever, or fatigue. But you\u2019re not sick; your immune system is just responding to the spike protein and gearing up to be able to recognize it in the future.\n\nThe mRNA from the vaccine quickly disappears\n\nThe mRNA from the vaccine doesn\u2019t stick around. Just as our cells are always making mRNAs, they are also constantly destroying them. mRNA is a temporary messenger, used and trashed within seconds of being made.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids, and both are \u201cgenetic material\u201d in a sense (DNA is our genetic material, RNA is the virus\u2019s genetic material), the mRNA cannot become part of our DNA and it does not do anything to change our DNA. It\u2019s a different type of molecule, in a different part of the cell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy mRNA vaccines?\n\nSeveral types of vaccines are being tested for COVID. Many use traditional technologies, like modifying a cold virus so that it cannot replicate, and so it also includes a coronavirus spike protein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut mRNA vaccines work particularly well in this situation because they can be made so fast. If you want to make a bunch of doses of a vaccine, you need to actually grow those viruses somehow. The flu vaccine has famously been grown in chicken eggs, for example.\n\nmRNA vaccines are quicker because you don\u2019t need any kind of cells to manufacture them. The technology for mRNA vaccines has been in the works for many years, and 2020 just happened to be their time to shine. If you\u2019d like to read more on how the vaccine was developed so quickly, we have an explainer on that here.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.app.com/story/entertainment/dining/2020/12/29/barstool-sports-barstool-fund-marandolas-bradley-beach-restaurant/4069904001/", "authors": [], "title": "Barstool Sports founder donates money to help Bradley Beach restaurant", "text": "People have strong feelings about Dave Portnoy, the opinionated founder of Barstool Sports who is famous for his man-on-the-street pizza reviews.\n\nBut since the middle of December, the creator of One Bite Pizza Reviews has raised more than $8 million to help small business who are hurting because of the pandemic \u2013 including one at the Shore.\n\nOn Dec. 24, Portnoy shared his phone call with Mark Marandola, who opened Marandola's in Bradley Beach in 2017, on Barstool Sports' Facebook page.

Wade -- not political pressure -- that led him to change course.\n\nIn the 2006 video, Biden called himself the \"odd man out\" in the Democratic Party on the issue because of his votes to limit government funding for abortion and votes in support of bans on certain late-term abortions.\n\n\"I'm a little bit of an odd man out in my party,\" Biden said. \"I do not vote for funding for abortion. I voted against partial birth abortion -- to limit it -- and I vote for no restrictions on a woman's right to be able to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade. And, so I am -- I made everybody angry. I made the right-to-life people angry because I won't support a constitutional amendment or limitations on a woman's right to exercise her constitutional right as defined by Roe v. Wade. And I've made the groups -- the women's groups and others -- very angry because I won't support public funding and I won't support partial birth abortion.\"\n\nRead More", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-idUSKBN1ZW0DG", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "title": "Sovereignty comes first: Britain lays out tough stance for EU trade talks", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain laid out a tough opening stance for future talks with the European Union on Sunday, saying it would set its own agenda rather than meeting the bloc\u2019s rules to ensure frictionless trade.\n\nAfter officially leaving the EU on Friday, Britain now must negotiate future trade relations with the bloc, to take effect when a standstill transition period expires at the end of the year.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government has been quick to send Brussels a message before trade talks begin in March: Brexit, for him, means sovereignty trumps the economy.\n\nThe EU has repeatedly told Britain the level of access to its lucrative single market will depend on how far London agrees to adhere to a \u201clevel playing field\u201d \u2014 shorthand for rules on environmental standards, labor regulations and state aid.\n\nBut despite the appeals of many businesses for the government to ensure goods can trade across borders freely, ministers have been briefing companies that they should adjust to a new future when Britain will not adhere to EU rules.\n\nJohnson, according to sources close to him, has taken last year\u2019s election, which handed him a large majority in parliament, as approval for his policy of putting Britain\u2019s right to set its own rules above the demands of businesses. He will outline that approach in a speech on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are taking back control of our laws, so we are not going to have high alignment with the EU, legislative alignment with their rules,\u201d foreign minister Dominic Raab told Sky News. \u201cBut we\u2019ll want to cooperate and we expect the EU to follow through on their commitment to a Canada-style free trade agreement.\u201d\n\nAfter more than three years of often tortuous talks, Johnson wants to draw a line under what has been an angry debate that has deepened divides across the country. His aim is a trade deal allowing for tariff- and quota-free trade in goods, similar to the terms the bloc now has in place with Canada.\n\nAsked whether the government expected businesses to have to prepare for new checks on goods at the border, Raab said: \u201cThe agreement that we made with the EU was to avoid all of that, and I am sure they will want to live up to the undertakings they have made just as we\u2019d expect to do the same.\u201d\n\nLate on Saturday, a government source said if the EU would not offer a Canada-style trade deal, London would instead pursue a looser trade agreement, similar to the bloc\u2019s ties with Australia.\n\n\u201cThere are only two likely outcomes in negotiation - a free trade deal like Canada or a looser arrangement like Australia - and we are happy to pursue both,\u201d the source said.\n\nThe EU says it will not seal a trade deal with a large, economically powerful neighbor without solid provisions to guarantee fair competition. Some European leaders fear Johnson could try to undercut EU businesses by loosening regulatory standards, something he has promised not to do.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cIf Great Britain wants to establish outside the European Union a sort of \u2018Singapore-on-Thames\u2019, we would be against it,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said in a joint interview with broadcasters LCI and RTL and Le Figaro newspaper.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar also called on the British government not to set strict red lines, saying this could make an already difficult negotiation even harder.\n\n\u201cOne thing I\u2019d say to everyone is let\u2019s not repeat some of the errors that were made in the past two-and-a-half years,\u201d Varadkar told the BBC. \u201cLet\u2019s not set such rigid red lines that makes it hard to come to an agreement and let\u2019s tone down the nationalistic rhetoric.\u201d", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-releases-physicians-letter-attesting-to-her-health/2019/12/05/d8a2822a-17ac-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign"], "title": "Elizabeth Warren releases physician\u2019s letter attesting to her health", "text": "By releasing her records first, Warren arguably sets a bar for the others in a presidential field that includes four contenders who, if elected, would be the country\u2019s oldest president at their first inauguration.\n\nAD\n\nWarren takes medication for hypothyroidism, a common condition in which the thyroid gland is underactive, according to the letter.

Let\u2019s run. Let\u2019s do whatever you want to do. Let\u2019s take an IQ test. Okay?\u201d\n\nAfter a debate in September in which his answers sometimes meandered and one challenger appeared to allude to his age, Biden committed to releasing his health records ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.

Rob was originally a man in Hornby\u2019s book and John Cusack played him in the movie.\n\nZoe Kravitz | Phillip Caruso/Hulu\n\nKravitz is Rob, the record store owner and DJ who uses music to cope with her breakups. Rob analyzes her five most significant breakups to find out what she\u2019s doing wrong in relationships. In the movie, Bonet played a love interest for Rob.

(The film officially opens July 19). As of right now, the film stands at a very meh 57% on Rotten Tomatoes, a website that aggregates film reviews. Another website, Metacritic, has it at with a score of 55, describing the reviews as \"mixed or average.\"\n\nBuzzFeed News' Adam B. Vary, a senior film reporter, attended the movie's premiere on Tuesday in Los Angeles and had this to say about the project from an emotional standpoint.\n\n#TheLionKing is a landmark *visual* experience. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and I think it\u2019s going to change how we look at movies forever. As an *emotional* experience, though\u2026I\u2019ll put it this way: It turns out lions can\u2019t really emote.\n\nI was lucky enough to see the film at a packed press screening on Wednesday night and can tell you that my colleague is right. The animals' photorealistic faces lose a lot of the emotion that came in the original. Some of the scenes just weren't as powerful as they were in the 1994 film, including the death of Mufasa, which felt stunted. The stoic expression on the senior lion\u2019s face as he plunged to his death didn\u2019t have the sad or traumatic effect director Jon Favreau may have been going for. Instead, I just felt indifferent. That said, the film is a visual masterpiece, and some characters, including Timon (Billy Eichner), Pumbaa (Seth Rogen), Zazu (John Oliver), and Nala (Beyonc\u00e9), were strong. During the screening I attended, Timon and Pumbaa absolutely stole the show with their lively banter and jokes, some of which were improvised according to Eichner. The theater pretty much roared with laughter every time they were on screen.\n\nDisney\n\nBut to a degree, this version of The Lion King is resting on the laurels of its beloved predecessor, as it adheres so closely to the original that some critics have called it an unnecessary shot for shot remake. And that's being kind. Some of the reviews were VICIOUS. IndieWire's David Ehrlich called the updated version a \"soulless chimera of a film [that] comes off as little more than a glorified tech demo from a greedy conglomerate \u2014 a well-rendered but creatively bankrupt self-portrait of a movie studio eating its own tail.\"\n\nSome critics have described the film as a failure of the imagination, one that did little to reinvent itself in a major way for 2019, especially when compared to other recent Disney remakes. \"But unlike with this year\u2019s Dumbo, which pushed past the plot markers of the 1941 movie, or Aladdin, which saw an opportunity for the underserved Jasmine, the team behind The Lion King saw no room for improvement other than a hyper-realistic overhaul,\" wrote Matt Patches, a senior editor at Vox's Polygon.\n\n\n\nDisney\n\nSome, like the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, were more even-handed, saying it \"sticks very closely to the original version, and in that sense it\u2019s of course watchable and enjoyable.\" \"But I missed the simplicity and vividness of the original hand-drawn images,\" he continued. \"The circle of commercial life has given birth to this all-but-indistinguishable digiclone descendant.\"\n\nScott Mendelson of Forbes warned prospective moviegoers to \"be prepared for a crushing disappointment.\" And critics aren't the only ones getting in on the action.

DC just announced that Snyder will be releasing a special version of his 2017 film, Justice League, that will be closer to his original vision for the movie. While fans are hopeful that Snyder\u2019s cut of Justice League will redeem Ben Affleck, the actor recently shared his thoughts on his big return as the caped crusader.\n\nZack Snyder, with \u2018Justice League\u2019 stars Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, and Gal Gadot | Manuel Velasquez/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nInside Affleck\u2019s run as Batman\n\nWhen DC first announced that Affleck was the new Batman, fans had a mixed reaction to the news. But over time, people warmed up to the idea of Affleck playing Bruce Wayne and were excited to see what he could bring to the table.\n\nTo be fair, Affleck\u2019s version of Batman was not that bad. But the actor\u2019s legacy was hurt by a series of bad movies that were not entirely his fault. This started with his first appearance as the Caped Crusader was in the 2016 film, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\n\nAlthough the movie earned over $873 million at the box office, its budget of $300 million cut into the profits. Critics also panned the film for its slow pacing, overly complicated storyline, and dark tone.\n\nAffleck\u2019s next appearance as Batman was a brief cameo in Suicide Squad, a film that also received mixed reviews from the critics. But his first two movies as Batman were nothing compared to the disaster that was Justice League.\n\nNot only did Justice League lose money at the box office, but it was also slammed by critics for a variety of issues, including bad graphics, poor pacing, lackluster writing, and a bad plot. It didn\u2019t help that Snyder was forced to leave the project after suffering a personal loss.\n\nSome fans were so disappointed that they basically wanted a redo. And with Snyder\u2019s cut of the movie finally in the works, they might get their wish after all.\n\nHBO to release Zack Snyder\u2019s \u2018Justice League\u2019\n\nThree years have passed since Justice League premiered in theaters, and after a myriad of campaigns and requests, Justice League Snyder Cut is finally going to become a reality.\n\nAccording to We Got This Covered, the director recently opened up about the new version of the movie and confirmed that it will be a completely different experience than the theatrical release. Snyder, of course, never watched the movie when it hit theaters as Joss Whedon stepped in and finished it.\n\n\u201cIt will be an entirely new thing, and, especially talking to those who have seen the released movie, a new experience apart from that movie. You probably saw one-fourth of what I did,\u201d Snyder explained.\n\nSnyder did not reveal what will be included in the new release but there are plenty of things that will likely be addressed. This includes giving each character additional time on-screen, which should add more depth to the storyline.\n\nFans might even get to see more of the film\u2019s main villain, Steppenwolf, as well as Darkseid actually making an appearance. Regardless of what Snyder includes in the release, it should offer a more complete version of the movie since it is coming from one director instead of two.\n\nAffleck opens up about his return as Batman in \u2018Justice League\u2019\n\nAmid all of the hoopla surrounding Snyder\u2019s cut of Justice League, Affleck recently chimed in on his big return as Batman. Taking to social media, the actor shared a poster of the film and wrote, \u201c2021\u201d in the caption.\n\nThe post was simple enough but it immediately started trending on Twitter and quickly amassed over 8k retweets. Not only are fans looking forward to what Snyder adds to the movie, but there is also hope that it gives Affleck a better sending off as the Caped Crusader.\n\nRELATED: \u2018The Batman\u2019: Ben Affleck Finally Opens Up About Being Replaced By Robert Pattinson\n\nAffleck was originally supposed to play Bruce Wayne in a stand-alone film in the DCEU.

EDGE Jadeveon Clowney: It seems there is still significant interest in him, though he might be asking for too much money. He\u2019s a game-changer for whoever signs him, whether that\u2019s the Browns or the Seahawks re-sign him.\n\n2. QB Cam Newton: If he\u2019s willing to be a backup this season, he\u2019ll have more options. He should be a starter somewhere, but if it hasn\u2019t happened by now he might need to wait for an injury.\n\n3. EDGE Everson Griffen: He\u2019s still an extremely productive pass rusher who will likely get paid shortly after Clowney.\n\n4. CB Logan Ryan: A high-quality cornerback that might be asking for too much money.\n\n5. G Larry Warford: He\u2019s been a Pro Bowler a few years running and will start for someone in 2020. Count on it.\n\n6. EDGE Markus Golden: Unless he\u2019s signed elsewhere before July 22, his rights will revert back to the Giants last season. He had 10 sacks last year but might not get much more than his Giants qualifying over.\n\n7. EDGE Clay Matthews: He\u2019s past his prime, certainly, but is still a productive (eight sacks) pass rusher.\n\n8. OT Jason Peters: He\u2019s 38, but Peters is an ageless wonder and at worst a league-average left tackle. He\u2019ll be an upgrade for someone, maybe even the Eagles.\n\n9. CB Darqueze Dennard: He was supposed to sign with the Jaguars before that deal fell through, but he\u2019s a starter-quality cornerback.\n\n10. EDGE Cameron Wake: Another aging pass rusher who still has something left in the tank.\n\n11. OT Demar Dotson: At worst, Dotson would be a solid swing tackle option for a team in need of a veteran presence. He\u2019d be an upgrade as a starter for some teams.\n\n12. DT Damon Harrison: The former Giants defensive tackle can still be a solid run-stopper for someone.\n\n13. S Eric Reid: He didn\u2019t have his best season last year but Reid can still be a leader in a locker room and still has some football left in him.\n\n14. RB Devonta Freeman: He\u2019s not good enough to be a bell-cow, and might be asking for too much money, but he\u2019s an intriguing option as a potential No. 2 somewhere. Perhaps the Eagles will bite?\n\n15. TE Delanie Walker: He\u2019s older and coming off a serious injury, but in a league that isn\u2019t exactly littered with quality, productive tight ends these days, Walker is worth bringing in, even if it\u2019s just as a No. 2.\n\nGet Giants text messages from reporters: Cut through the clutter of social media and text directly with the Giants beat writers.

Many wearable devices that track the number of steps a person takes each day come pre-programmed with a daily goal of 10,000 steps. But while a large body of evidence shows that physical activity is good for a person's health and longevity, few studies have examined how many steps a day are associated with good health, particularly long-term health outcomes. A new study led by investigators from Brigham and Women's Hospital sought to address this knowledge gap by examining outcomes over an average of more than four years for older women in the Women's Health Study who had measured their steps for a full week. The team reports that, among older women, taking as few as 4,400 steps per day was significantly associated with lower risk of death compared to taking 2,700 steps per day. Risk of death continued to decrease with more steps taken but leveled off at around 7,500 steps per day -- less than the 10,000 steps default goal in many wearables. The team's results are presented today at the American College of Sports Medicine Annual Meeting and published simultaneously in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\n\"Taking 10,000 steps a day can sound daunting. But we find that even a modest increase in steps taken is tied to significantly lower mortality in older women,\" said I-Min Lee, MBBS, ScD, an epidemiologist in the Division of Preventive Medicine at the Brigham. \"Our study adds to a growing understanding of the importance of physical activity for health, clarifies the number of steps related to lower mortality and amplifies the message: Step more -- even a little more is helpful.\"\n\nAccording to previous studies, the average number of steps taken by people in the U.S. is between 4,000 and 5,000 per day. The origin of the 10,000-step goal is unclear but may trace back to 1965, when a Japanese company began marketing a pedometer called Manpo-kei, which translates to \"10,000 steps meter\" in Japanese.\n\nTo conduct their study, Lee and colleagues included participants from the Women's Health Study, a randomized trial originally conducted to evaluate risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer among women taking low-dose aspirin and vitamin E. When the original trial ended, participants were invited to participate in a long-term observational study. For the present study of steps and health, almost 18,000 women were asked to wear an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer device -- a research grade wearable -- on their hips for seven consecutive days during all waking hours. The team analyzed 16,741 of the women who were compliant with wearing the device; their average age was 72.\n\nParticipants were followed for an average of more than four years, during which time 504 women died. Participants in the bottom 25 percent of steps walked (average of 2,700 steps per day) were at greatest risk of death, with 275 women dying. Those who walked modestly more (average of 4,400 per day) were at 41 percent lower risk of death. Risk of death continued to decrease with more steps walked, up to 7,500 steps per day, after which risk leveled off. The team also found that for women who walked the same number of steps per day, the intensity -- how fast or slow they walked -- was not associated with risk of death.\n\nDue to the observational nature of the study, the authors cannot definitively separate cause from correlation (that is, to differentiate between \"do more steps lower mortality?\" or \"do women in better health step more?\"). However, the team did take several measures to try to ensure that the association observed was more likely causal than not, such as excluding women with heart disease, cancer, diabetes and less than excellent or good self-rated health and excluding the first year of follow-up data. The findings also are supported by previous experiments showing physical activity causes beneficial changes in short-term markers of health e.g., blood pressure, insulin/glucose levels, lipid profile, inflammation, and more.\n\nThe Women's Health Study included primarily older, white women, and further studies will be needed in younger and diverse populations to determine if the findings are applicable to other groups, especially those who may, on average, take more steps. Other outcomes -- such as quality of life and risk of specific diseases -- were not assessed, but will be addressed in future studies.\n\n\"Of course, no single study stands alone. But our work continues to make the case for the importance of physical activity,\" said Lee. \"Clearly, even a modest number of steps was related to lower mortality rate among these older women. We hope these findings provide encouragement for individuals for whom 10,000 steps a day may seem unattainable.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.kcra.com/article/judge-threatens-to-force-pgande-to-hire-more-tree-trimmers/30556519", "authors": ["Michael Liedtke"], "title": "Judge threatens to force PG&E to hire more tree trimmers", "text": "Hide Transcript Show Transcript\n\nI\u2019M TONI VALLIERE.

Those dangers are one reason the nation's largest utility has resorted to deliberately turning off the power in dry, windy and hot conditions - a strategy that at one point left an estimated 2 million people without power in October.PG&E has said the deliberate blackouts could be a recurring event for the next decade while it spends billions of dollars to upgrade its outdated electrical grid. Alsup said he thinks that reliance on blackouts stems in part from PG&E's tree-trimming shortcomings. The company said it will respond to Alsup by his Feb. 12 deadline. In its disclosure Wednesday to the judge, PG&E asserted it's unrealistic to expect it to be able to ensure all trees are maintained in a way that ensures all the branches, leaves and other vegetation remain a safe distance from its transmission lines.\u201cPerfect compliance would require nothing less than round-the-clock surveillance\" of the tens of millions of trees that it estimates could come into contact with its lines in an expanse covering about 70,000 square miles, PG&E wrote in the filing. But Alsup was apparently unswayed, noting that PG&E had blamed some of its problems on not being able to find enough contractors to do the work. Now, he is mulling whether he should issue an order that would require PG&E to hire and train more people to do the tree-trimming work. The requirement expanding PG&E's payroll could come at the same time the utility is mired in bankruptcy. It's trying to dig out of a financial hole created after its transmission lines were blamed for a series of catastrophic wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Those blazes left the company with more than $50 billion in claimed losses, a liability that PG&E is trying to erase in bankruptcy court by June 30.Alsup isn't involved in the bankruptcy case, but he has oversight over PG&E as part of a five-year probation slapped on the company in 2017 following its criminal conviction for a natural gas explosion in 2010 that killed eight people and destroyed 38 homes in San Bruno, California. The judge scheduled a Feb. 19 hearing to determine whether he should make hiring more tree trimmers a new condition of that probation.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-semiconductor-stocks-set-beat-135101178.html", "authors": ["Zacks Equity Research"], "title": "3 Semiconductor Stocks Set to Beat This Earnings Season", "text": "Semiconductors, which are the building blocks of most emerging technologies like AI and IoT, have been struggling over the last few quarters due to declining memory prices (both DRAM and NAND) and lower demand from smartphone OEMs. This trend is expected to impact results of the industry players in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.\n\nTariffs on electronics due to U.S.-China trade dispute may negatively impact the demand for chips, in turn, impacting semiconductor industry players' results.\n\nSluggishness in the PC market has been a headwind.

While some may simply be returned to leasing firms, others belonged to Qatar. Does this mean an unexpected fleet expansion for the Middle East airline, or could a certain up and coming African airline be in for an aircraft windfall? Let\u2019s find out.\n\nWhat aircraft did Air Italy fly?\n\nAccording to data from Planespotters, Air Italy operated a modest fleet of just 12 aircraft. These included four Airbus A330-200s and eight Boeing 737s. The 737s were mixed between the 737-700, of which it had just one, the 737-800, of which it had four and three Boeing 737 MAX 8s.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at its widebody aircraft first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Airbus A330s\n\nAir Italy\u2019s four Airbus A330-200s were relatively new to the airline, having been delivered between May 2018 and October 2018. However, they were not new aircraft. The youngest had clocked 15.2 years in service, while the oldest was just over 17 years of age. Older aircraft for sure, but perhaps not at the end of their useful life yet.\n\nAdvertisement Featured Video:\n\nSince the announcement of Air Italy\u2019s bankruptcy, the four aircraft have been listed as \u2018stored\u2019. This is because Air Italy is no longer flying, but really it just means they are parked up and no longer in service.\n\nAll four A330s were on lease from Air Italy\u2019s investor Qatar Airways. Qatar owned 49% of the airline, the maximum allowed for a foreign investor. In terms of ownership, these aircraft still belong to Qatar Airways, and will, therefore, be returned to the parent company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Qatar likes to boast a young fleet, and has a current average fleet age of just 5.9 years. The A330-200s it retains in its fleet are, on average, just 9.5 years old, so it\u2019s unlikely that Qatar will want to take these aircraft back It\u2019s more likely that the Middle East airline will look to lease these out to another partner, rather than operate them itself.\n\nThe Boeing 737s\n\nAir Italy had three brand new Boeing 737 MAX in its fleet, which it didn\u2019t get to operate for very long. However, although Air Italy was the first airline to operate these three planes, they weren\u2019t actually ordered by the carrier. All the MAX in Air Italy\u2019s fleet were also Qatar Airways planes, sent to Air Italy by its investor to kick start operations.\n\nIn total, it had sub-leased 20 737 MAX from Qatar, with a further 17 due between now and 2022. Qatar does not operate the 737 MAX itself, so it will be interesting to see what the airline does with these three returning MAX aircraft, as well as the other 17 that Boeing is preparing to deliver.\n\nOf the NGs, all were leased. AirFleets notes lessors including GECAS, BBAM, FTAI and Wilmington as owners of these aircraft, so given time, all will end up back with the leasing body. Prior to that, these aircraft are likely to go to a maintenance service to be stripped of Air Italy livery and prepared for their next customer.\n\nWhere could the Qatar aircraft go?\n\nIt would be a strange and unusual move to see Qatar operating its returned MAX and A330s itself. The airline has no need for these planes and they don\u2019t fit well into its current fleet strategy. While Qatar may well look to the open market to get these planes leased out, there is a more interesting proposition on the horizon.\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar invested in RwandAir, the flag carrier of Rwanda. Qatar also owns 60% of the airline\u2019s under construction hub airport, Bugesera International. Qatar sent these planes to Air Italy to give its growth a kick start\u2026 could it do the same for RwandAir?\n\nRwandAir already operates the A330, with one -300 and one -200 in its fleet. It also has a total of six 737 NGs in operation, and two MAX 8s on order. These aircraft would fit beautifully into RwandAir fleet, and could give the airline a healthy bump in capacity, likely at preferential rates too.\n\nWhat do you think? Will RwandAir take Qatar\u2019s \u2018spare\u2019 Air Italy aircraft? Or do you foresee other plans for these planes?

Because those laboratories may not always report people who tested negative for the coronavirus, the true number of people tested is probably somewhat higher.\n\nConfusion about that exact number persists even at the highest reaches government. Earlier on Tuesday, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said he couldn\u2019t provide the figure. \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly how many because hundreds of thousands of our tests have gone out to private labs and hospitals that currently do not report in to CDC,\u201d he said in a CNN appearance.\n\nThat number stands in stark contrast to the promises made by leading members of the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus task force, who have variously asserted that 75,000 people would be tested by last week\u2019s end and that laboratories across the United States would have the capacity to conduct 1.5 million tests by the beginning of this week.\n\nNeither claim appears to yet be close to realized, angering some Washington lawmakers. \u201cWe are in a crisis, and there are questions about our preparedness and ongoing response efforts,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said on Tuesday morning. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned \u2014 and, I think, we all are \u2014 about our nation\u2019s capabilities for coronavirus. Other countries have been testing thousands of people for weeks, but the U.S. is woefully behind the curve.\u201d\n\nThe nation\u2019s ability to test for the coronavirus was hampered early on because a test created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was found to have a contaminated reagent, meaning that one of its three markers \u2014 the one that would indicate a person was not infected \u2014 was not operational.\n\nA demonstration at a California Department of Public Health lab in February of the equipment and procedures that will be used to conduct tests for novel coronavirus. (California Department of Public Health via AP) More\n\nThe CDC eventually corrected that error but also had to grapple with the fact that by keeping the coronavirus tests within its own purview, it was severely limiting the numbers who could be tested. It has since allowed private and university laboratories to conduct testing, while also vowing to stock public health labs with sufficient quantities of the coronavirus test.\n\nStill, the lag is evident, robbing epidemiologists of precious days as they seek to contain the spread of the disease.\n\nPrivate laboratories are expected to intensify their own testing efforts, but as of Monday morning, Mark S. Birenbaum, who heads the National Independent Laboratory Association, said he was uncertain of how many of his members had begun to test for the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cMany have not,\u201d he wrote in a text message.\n\nCDC spokesman Richard Quartarone said that as of Monday evening, the Atlanta-based public health agency had tested 1,707 people. On March 3, that number had been 1,200 people, which means the CDC has tested 507 people in the last week, or about 72 per day.\n\nIn a congressional hearing on Tuesday, CDC Director Robert Redfield, MD, said that state laboratories had tested 4,856 people. The source of that statistic is not clear: The day before, both the White House and the CDC said that information was not available. An industry group representing public laboratories also said it had not yet gathered the data.\n\nState laboratories had tested 3,280 people as of Monday evening. That number is derived from the COVID Tracking Project, started by Denver-based venture capitalist Jeff Hammerbacher and journalists from the Atlantic, put the number of people tested by state labs at a somewhat lower 3,280. The data compiled by Hammerbacher slightly understates the number of people tested, since some states report only positive test results.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cincyjungle.com/bengals-news/2019/9/2/20844765/bengals-eagles-news-wendell-smallwood-nfl-free-agents-2019", "authors": ["Sep"], "title": "Bengals placed waiver claim on Wendell Smallwood", "text": "When the waiver wire frenzy hit on Saturday and Sunday, most expected the Cincinnati Bengals to look at bolstering their offensive line and/or linebacker groups.\n\nInstead, the team grabbed running back Samaje Perine and wide receiver/returner Pharoh Cooper off of the waiver wire.\n\nHowever, it appears that Perine wasn\u2019t the only back the Bengals coveted from waivers.

(SWNS)\n\nSpeaking of her daughter\u2019s deterioration, Havens said: \u201cI personally believe COVID-19 is responsible for the severity of it.\u201d\n\nThe mother-of-three and her husband Justin, 52, are awaiting the result of a blood test that should reveal if Grace has antibodies against the coronavirus.\n\nAntibodies are immune-fighting proteins that circulate in the bloodstream after an individual has overcome an infection.\n\nIf the person encounters the same virus again, their immune system ramps up production of these \u201cmemory\u201d antibodies, preventing the infection taking hold for a second time.\n\nTesting positive for antibodies would indicate Grace has had the coronavirus, however, false positives may occur.\n\nSpeaking of the blood test, Havens said: \u201cIt won\u2019t change anything for Grace. At the end of the day, I believe she had it, but it\u2019s not going to change anything because we are where we are.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happening is children are getting coronavirus mildly, but it\u2019s triggering this extra awful inflammatory syndrome in them.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of coronavirus complications worldwide are occurring in the elderly or those with health issues. Children tend to have mild symptoms or none at all.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoronavirus: A \u2018number of children randomly but severely affected\u2019\n\nGrace came home from school on 28 February complaining of abdominal pain and a fever.\n\nAfter two visits to the GP, Grace was sent to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital\u2019s children\u2019s centre with suspected appendicitis \u2013 when the appendix becomes inflamed, or peritonitis \u2013 swelling of the membrane that lines the inner abdominal wall.\n\nFinding no cause for concern, doctors sent Grace home.\n\nThe teenager was rushed back to hospital on 5 March when she developed a rash.\n\nShe spent the next four weeks on morphine and fentanyl as medics tried to ease her discomfort.\n\nAfter losing a stone (14lb), Grace was fed both nasally and intravenously.\n\nBlood was later discovered in her faeces, prompting doctors to transfer her to the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, where she stayed for three weeks.\n\nAs if she had not endured enough, Grace went on to develop crescentic nephritis. The severe kidney inflammation can cause the organs to lose function in days.\n\nThankfully, the teenager pulled through and is home with her family.\n\nHer mother, an event planner, is speaking out to raise awareness of the dangers of the coronavirus in young people.\n\n\u201cWhile we are told the majority of children will be unharmed by [the infection], there appear to be a number who are randomly but severely affected,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is why I felt we should share our daughter\u2019s story, with the aim of raising awareness in the hope that as science progresses, less lives will be affected.\u201d\n\nCoronavirus: Inflammation occurring in some children\n\nHSP typically causes a purple rash, particularly on the lower body.\n\nSome patients also develop abdominal and joint pain.\n\nIn rare cases, severe kidney damage can occur.\n\nAlthough unclear, HSP is thought to come about due to an over-reaction of the immune system to an infection.\n\nNHS doctors have been told to look out for signs of \u201cmulti-system inflammation\u201d after intensive care units in London saw eight children with unusual symptoms, some of whom tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nMedics likened the mysterious inflammation to Kawasaki disease.\n\nThis is a rare condition that usually affects children under five and causes blood vessels to become inflamed, leading to heart complications in about a quarter (25%) of patients.\n\nLeft untreated, the complications can be fatal in 2% to 3% of youngsters.\n\nSymptoms usually include fever, rash, red eyes, dry or cracked lips, swollen lymph nodes, and redness on the palms and soles of the feet.\n\nExperts have warned these symptoms are a sign the body is overwhelmed as it tries to fight an infection.\n\nGrace developed a purple spotty rash. (SWNS)\n\nCoronavirus: Should parents be concerned by the inflammatory disorder?\n\nOverall, children who have caught the coronavirus have been relatively unaffected.\n\nPeople under 18 made up just 2% of cases reported in a large UK study.\n\nSpeaking at a recent Science Media Centre briefing, Professor Russell Viner \u2013 president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health \u2013 estimated between 75 and 100 youngsters across the country have been admitted to hospital with the Kawasaki-like disease.\n\n\u201cThe total numbers of children who get this syndrome are very small,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAround 5,000 children die tragically each year. Some of these are premature babies, but 160 to 170 die in car crashes. Those deaths are tragic but also rare.\n\n\u201cHow do we manage those? We buy child seats, we use seat belts, we sometimes buy better cars; but we don\u2019t stop driving.\n\n\u201cThis syndrome is much, much more rare than car accidents involving children.\n\n\u201cIt should not stop parents sending their children back to school when schools are ready to re-open.\n\n\u201cWhat parents do need, however, is knowledge and understanding so they know what to look out for\u201d.\n\nAs of 27 April, NHS England knew of fewer than 20 cases where an association between the coronavirus and the Kawasaki-like condition had been noted by doctors, the BBC reported.\n\nIt issued an urgent alert to GPs to be aware of the condition, but stressed no link had been established with the coronavirus.\n\nProfessor Alastair Sutcliffe, from University College London, previously said: \u201cThere is apparently a small risk but no grounds for panic.\u201d\n\nCoronavirus: what happened today\n\nRead more about COVID-19\n\nHow to get a coronavirus test if you have symptoms\n\nWhat you can and can\u2019t do under lockdown rules\n\nIn pictures: How UK school classrooms could look in new normal\n\nHow public transport could look after lockdown\n\nHow our public spaces will change in the future\n\nHelp and advice\n\nRead the full list of official FAQs here\n\n10 tips from the NHS to help deal with anxiety\n\nWhat to do if you think you have symptoms\n\nHow to get help if you've been furloughed\n\n\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://nesn.com/2019/09/why-didnt-patriots-trade-brian-hoyer-a-lot-of-things-involved/", "authors": ["Doug Kyed"], "title": "Why Didn\u2019t Patriots Trade Brian Hoyer? \u2018A Lot Of Things Involved\u2019", "text": "Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nThe New England Patriots released backup quarterback Brian Hoyer rather than trading him Saturday during cutdowns. After Hoyer signed a three-year deal worth $12 million with the Indianapolis Colts on Monday, this apparently became a controversial decision over Labor Day Weekend.\n\nPatriots head coach Bill Belichick was asked why the Patriots didn\u2019t trade Hoyer on Tuesday during a conference call.\n\n\u201cI think there were a lot of things involved in that situation,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cThat would be a longer conversation. We did what we did. We\u2019ll stand by that.\u201d\n\nFirst, the Patriots reportedly were considering bringing Hoyer back after releasing him in a somewhat similar situation to what occurred Saturday when they released wide receiver Demaryius Thomas then re-signed him Monday.\n\nSecond, there is no proven trade market for a 30-plus-year-old backup quarterback who is being traded to be a reserve with his new team. The closest instance we found was in 2010 when the Minnesota Vikings traded quarterback Sage Rosenfels and wide receiver Darius Reynaud for a seventh-round pick.\n\nOther older backup QBs that were traded, including Ryan Fitzpatrick in 2016, Matt Cassel in 2015, Matt Schaub in 2014 and Donovan McNabb in 2011, were dealt in the spring or summer and garnered late-round compensation. All of those players also were going to be competing for starting jobs with their new teams. Jacoby Brissett is the Colts\u2019 starting quarterback. He reportedly signed a two-year, $30 million contract extension Monday.\n\nThere\u2019s also the fact that in Hoyer\u2019s 10-year career through nine different stops, he\u2019s never once been traded, and he\u2019s been cut six times. Hoyer also signed a team-friendly deal to be Tom Brady\u2019s backup in 2017. It would have been a tough look to then take Hoyer on that Patriots-friendly deal and ship him off to a new team without his permission. Hoyer made bank by being cut.\n\nEven if the Patriots were able to trade Hoyer, it likely would have been for a sixth- or seventh-round pick. If the Patriots traded him, they clearly would not have been able to bring him back. So, they took a risk and released him, and Hoyer received an offer he couldn\u2019t refuse from the Colts, who had no reason to give up any draft compensation when they knew Hoyer would otherwise be released.\n\nThe Patriots maybe, possibly, could have received a late-round pick. They didn\u2019t.\n\nThumbnail photo via Bob DeChiara/USA TODAY Sports Images", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.newser.com/story/283215/twins-prospect-23-found-dead-in-hotel-room.html", "authors": ["Evann Gastaldo"], "title": "Twins Prospect, 23, Found Dead in Hotel Room", "text": "(Newser) \u2013 A 23-year-old Minnesota Twins prospect was found dead Sunday in his New Zealand hotel room, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports.

Her lawyers want to void the deal and collect at least $200,000 more from Ronaldo.\n\nRonaldo\u2019s attorneys have acknowledged that the soccer star and Mayorga had consensual sex in June 2009, but they denied it was rape. Attorney Peter Christiansen was traveling Monday and wasn\u2019t immediately available to comment.\n\nAttorneys for Mayorga, a former model and schoolteacher, did not immediately respond to telephone, text and email messages.\n\nThe Associated Press generally does not name people who say they are victims of sexual assault, but Mayorga gave consent through her lawyers to make her name public.\n\nHer lawsuit says she met Ronaldo at a nightclub and went with him and other people to his suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino, where he assaulted her in a bedroom. Afterward, she signed a non-disclosure agreement under pressure from \u201cfixers\u201d trying to protect Ronaldo\u2019s reputation, her lawyer, Leslie Mark Stovall, has said.\n\nThe lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas accuses Ronaldo or those working for him of conspiracy, defamation, breach of contract, coercion and fraud for allegedly allowing terms of the settlement to become public in European publications.\n\nHer attorneys say Mayorga never wanted her name released but became worried that she would be identified after a 2017 media report apparently referred to the encounter.\n\nHer lawyers have said in federal court documents that they were having trouble personally serving Ronaldo with legal filings. A judge has given them an Oct. 28 deadline.\n\nRonaldo plays in Italy for the Turin-based soccer club Juventus. He played previously for Manchester United in England and Real Madrid in Spain, where he earned a then-record sum of 94 million euros, or about $130 million.\n\nMayorga underwent a medical exam to collect DNA evidence shortly after she alleges Ronaldo assaulted her. Police closed their investigation in 2009 because Mayorga neither identified her attacker by name nor said where the alleged rape took place, said Wolfson, the elected prosecutor in Las Vegas.\n\nPolice have said she identified her attacker only as a European soccer player.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the police were unable to \u2026 conduct any meaningful investigation,\u201d Wolfson said Monday. \u201cDetectives were unable to search for and impound vital forensic evidence. In addition, video evidence, showing interactions between the victim and perpetrator before and after the alleged crime, was lost.\u201d\n\nThe investigation was reopened in last year at the request of Mayorga\u2019s attorneys, shortly before they sued Ronaldo. She spoke again with police, and authorities this year obtained a sample of Ronaldo\u2019s DNA through Italian authorities.\n\nPolice did not immediately respond Monday to messages about the case.\n\nAuthor: KEN RITTER/ Associated Press\n\nDo you see a typo or an error?

He also told the media his meetings with Rhule, team owner David Tepper and general manager Marty Hurney left him feeling inspired and he\u2019s eager to prove himself again.\n\nSo, what\u2019s going on?\n\nThere\u2019s no way to know for sure unless Newton explicitly spells it out for us.

Completed it, as the kids might say these days.\n\nBut it's the one trophy Liverpool have won more times than any other that remains the obsession, the Holy Grail. The bread and butter, as Bill Shankly would have it known.\n\nThe league title.\n\nNot since 1990 have the Reds been crowned kings of England, a fact that has never seemed more ludicrous than at the present time with Jurgen Klopp's side having become the first English team to win the international treble in the same year of European Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.\n\nWhile Roberto Firmino was netting the winner against Flamengo, back home Manchester City had just beaten Leicester City, meaning the Reds' 10-point lead at the top of the Premier League had in fact been strengthened, Klopp's side now having a game in hand.\n\n*Latest Liverpool transfer rumours and reaction to Club World Cup win\n\nIndeed, since Liverpool beat Watford last Saturday, Leicester have dropped five points, making the game at King Power Stadium on Boxing Day arguably a must-win for Brendan Rodgers' side.\n\nThat could play into Liverpool's hands, although City's statement victory means they are once again the team Klopp's men will be expected to fend off during the second half of the season.\n\nIf Saturday's win in Qatar was historic for the club, it was the ultimate justification of Henderson's captaincy.\n\nNot since Steven Gerrard in Istanbul in 2005 has a skipper so inspired a Liverpool team to victory in a final.\n\nHenderson's display was one of drive, determination and application, only a fine save from Flamengo goalkeeper Diego Alves denying him the goal his performance richly deserved.\n\nAll this after he had filled in so capably at centre-back in the semi-final win over Monterrey after Virgil van Dijk missed out through illness.\n\nIndeed, with his third trademark major trophy lift inside six months, Henderson has already matched the number achieved by Gerrard during his 12 years as captain. Liverpool will surely hope there is more to come.\n\nIt wasn't perfect. That energy-sapping extra time period will surely be felt when Klopp's side get deep into the festive Premier League period while the injury to Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is a major concern.\n\nBut a 7,000-mile round trip that could easily have been a distraction has instead only strengthened the collective belief Liverpool can, after three decades, get over the line in the championship race.\n\nA Merry Christmas could then eventually become the happiest of new years.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.phonearena.com/news/Samsung-remove-chargers-smartphones-2021_id125822", "authors": ["Cosmin Vasile"], "title": "Samsung may remove chargers from some smartphones starting 2021", "text": "Samsung may stop including chargers with some of its smartphones in the future, a new report coming from South Korea claims.

Set a favorite wallpaper, pick a ringtone, buy a case\u2014personalizing your phone is obviously a big part of the experience (some might even call it fun). But when I get a new phone, as frequently occurs as part of this job, my goal is to get it working the way I want and expect as quickly as possible. When I got my Galaxy S20, I went straight to work, and these are 20 of my top tweaks, tips, tricks, and changes that I've made. Not every one will be the right change for every person, but hopefully you'll find a few things here you either didn't know or had forgotten about.\n\n1. Use volume keys for media\n\nIn 2020, I think it's a little silly for your volume rocker to be doing anything but controlling media volume. We typically keep our phones in silent or vibrate mode, so controlling system or notification noises with the volume rocker is pretty pointless. Samsung is one of the few phone OEMs still not making media the default volume control out of the box, but changing this is simple enough: just hit the volume rocker, tap the drop-down arrow on the sound menu, and toggle \"Use Volume keys for media\" on. At that point, you'll be set.\n\n2. Order app drawer alphabetically\n\nThis one drives me batty: Samsung orders its app drawer grid in the launcher like a homescreen: new stuff goes to the end of the list, and it's on you to organize it. This makes no sense! To order your apps alphabetically, simply open up the app drawer, hit the 3-dot menu in the upper right, and tap \"Sort\" to find the alphabetical sort option. Much better.\n\n3. Expand home screen and app drawer icon grid\n\nBy default, Samsung allows surprisingly few icons on your homescreen grid, but with phones as large as they are now, there's really no reason not to be maximizing your real estate. Long tap on an empty area of the homescreen, hit Home screen settings, and set your home and app screen layouts to the largest configuration (5x6). So much room for activities!\n\n4. Switch default browser to Chrome\n\nThis is a personal choice, but as much cool stuff as Samsung's Internet browser can do, I just can't live without Chrome. If you're the same, you'll want to go into settings for default apps (in the apps area of the settings... app) and switch it to Chrome, otherwise all your links will open in Samsung Internet.\n\n5. Switch keyboard to Gboard\n\nI consider this mandatory. Samsung's virtual keyboard is just really, really bad. Suggestions are slow, not very good, and the layout just doesn't feel like it's especially good at predicting what your fingers are actually searching for. Download Gboard and I can promise you, you'll never go back.\n\n6. Disable Bixby key and change to power menu\n\nAs set up from the factory, holding the power key on your Galaxy S20 will not give you the expected options to... turn off (or restart) your phone. This is annoying and dumb. To fix it, drag down the notification shade, hit the power icon, and at the bottom of the screen you'll see a \"Side key settings\" button. From here, you can toggle the \"Press and hold\" function to open the power menu instead of Bixby, which, let's be honest, is really how this should be set up anyway. Who uses Bixby?\n\n7. Show battery % in status bar\n\nI'm a bit of a battery peeper, so knowing my exact battery percentage is kind of a must on my phone. It's easy enough to permanently add this to the phone's status bar, just pull down on the notification shade, pull down again for the expanded quick settings toggles, then hit the 3-dot menu button. You'll find a \"Status bar\" option, which has a toggle to show the battery percentage readout. (I also recommend toggling notification icons to \"All notifications\" if you want to see all your notifications in the status bar.)\n\n8. Always display brightness slider in quick settings, disable media and device controls\n\nIn the same 3-dot menu where the status bar options live is one for the quick panel layout. This allows you to toggle the brightness slider to appear whenever the notification shade is open, as opposed to only when the full quick settings toggles appear. I also at this point generally opt to disable the media and device controls interface, because it's pretty much useless, in my opinion, and just takes up space in the notification shade.\n\n9. Disable Samsung weather notifications\n\nDo you use the Google app? Does it send you weather notifications? Then you don't need a second app sending you another notification for the same weather you're already getting. Just go into the apps area of Settings, search for \"Weather,\" and disable all notifications for the app. This won't affect your homescreen weather widget, it just prevents needless notifications about information you don't need a second time.\n\n10. Increase display timeout\n\nSamsung sets the display timeout for its phones to 30 seconds out of the box, which I find annoyingly conservative (I may just be weird). I generally go into the display settings and set it to 5 or 10 minutes.\n\n11. Switch screen to 120Hz refresh\n\nYour Galaxy S20 has a fancy, buttery smooth 120Hz screen. You should use it! Samsung has the Galaxy S20 series in 60Hz refresh mode by default, because the phone's battery life is significantly better in this mode. But with a 4000mAh battery on even the smallest S20, I think it's going to be fine for most people to use the phone in 120Hz, and I've not seen a truly ridiculous drop in estimated usage as a result. Some people say they can't really see the difference with 120Hz enabled, and if so, you may as well leave it off, but for those of us who do, this is the point of no return. I must have high-refresh phones forever now.\n\n12. Decrease screen \"zoom\" or font size to show more content\n\nIf your vision isn't so great, this probably isn't a good one, but for me, it's a necessity. Samsung's default font scaling is just comically large to my eyes, so I always go into the display settings and turn it down a notch. The screen just looks less crowded and, uh, less like it was designed for someone in their mid-70s.\n\n13. Disable edge panels\n\nSamsung's edge screen feature was always kind of weird. I know some people who absolutely love it, but I find it's just something for me to accidentally open when I go to swipe near the edge of the display, especially when you enable Android 10's gesture navigation (which is my next tip). Just go into Settings and search for \"edge panels\" and you'll quickly find the toggle to disable them.\n\n14. Enable gesture navigation\n\nFor me, there's just no going back to traditional navigation keys. I have to use gesture nav now, forever. Enabling it is simple enough: go into Settings and search for \"navigation type,\" and select full screen gestures. I disabled the \"hints\" as I didn't find them necessary. Android 10's gesture navigation is so intuitive once you've used it for a few days, I highly suggest trying it out. Change is hard, but I haven't found a single person who hasn't been fully converted once they actually gave them an honest try.\n\n15. Enable swipe from homescreen for notification panel\n\nSamsung's launcher on the Galaxy S20 opens the app draw whether you swipe up or down on the homescreen, but this is easily changed: open up the homescreen settings and look for the \"Swipe down for notification panel\" toggle. I also disable app icon badges (pretty useless!) while I'm in here, and Samsung has some other options like landscape mode that you might want to enable.\n\n16. Disable smart alert vibrations\n\nSmart alert is a well-intended but highly annoying feature of Samsung smartphones. Basically, Smart alert will vibrate when you pick up your phone if any calls or messages came in while your phone was sitting idle. I find it unsettling, for one, and just sort of pointless, for another. If I'm picking up my phone, I'm going to look at my notifications, I don't need a reminder! Also, any phone buzzing that is not necessary is bad buzzing.\n\n17. Disable putting unused apps to sleep\n\nSamsung's power saving protocols for One UI employ a behavior called app \"sleeping\" that I'm not particularly fond of. In short, this sleeping will cause apps you use infrequently to have severely limited (or effectively no) ability to run in the background. The idea here is that people install a bunch of apps they never use, and those apps together create incremental battery drain with their various check-ins and background processes that reduce your phone's longevity. For those with limited smartphone knowledge, that may be a good idea, but for me, the idea I might miss a notification from an app because my phone decided I didn't need that app to be able to wake up in the background causes significant paranoia. Which leads to my next adjustment.\n\n18. Disable power optimization for Google Photos\n\nGoogle Photos is one of my favorite apps, and its near-instant cloud backup function is one of my favorite features of that app. Except, ever since Android started queuing background tasks more aggressively with the \"battery optimization\" feature, those uploads may not commence for hours after snapping a picture. This kind of defeats the purpose of the whole thing. Fortunately, you can disable this behavior on a per-app basis. This is kind of a tricky setting to find, and it's not where you'd probably think. Go into Settings, and search for \"Optimize battery usage,\" which should take you to the Special access menu. Hit optimize battery usage, then tap \"App not optimized\" and select \"All.\" Then, search for Photos, and toggle it to the off position. Now your photos and videos will upload as soon as they're taken, as Google Photos intended.\n\n19. Lower notification vibration intensity\n\nOne of my least favorite things about Samsung phone is their raucous default vibration strength for notifications\u2014it's actually loud. Compared to the gentle haptics of the Pixel line, this always take some getting used to for me, but one way you can make it a little less... aggressive is go into Settings for sounds and vibration and set the vibration intensity for notifications to the minimum level. Even at its lowest setting, it's still pretty strong, but it's noticeably less grating to my ears. It's a small thing in the grand scheme, but one which I think makes using my phone less stressful. I can't bear to put it on full silent, so this is the best compromise I can manage.\n\n20. Disable Samsung Daily\n\nSamsung Daily, or the artist formerly known as the Bixby pane, is Samsung's take on a Google Discover-y feed sort of thing. Some people may like it, but I don't need an app I never intend to interact with using up data and RAM living on my home screen. Just long-press on the homescreen, swipe over to the Samsung Daily panel, and you'll see a toggle at the top to disable it. It's kind of hard to find if you don't know where to look, and I just kind of assumed it was there until someone pointed this out to me.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/14/business/mcdonalds-china-coronavirus-sign-trnd/index.html", "authors": ["Jordan Valinsky", "Cnn Business"], "title": "McDonald's China apologizes for banning black people from a store", "text": "New York (CNN Business) McDonald's is in damage control mode after a restaurant in China displayed a sign banning black people from the premises.\n\nThe sign, which recently circulated on social media, said the McDonald's location in Guangzhou has \"been informed that from now on black people are not allowed to enter the restaurant.\"\n\nAgain, for those who still doubt that Black people and particularly #AfricansinChina are being targeted we feel it is our duty to share this.

Takes To Get The Perfect Contract", "text": "DETROIT\u2014The General Motors employees who have been working a picket line instead of an assembly line the past month say they have a backup plan if they can\u2019t secure what they feel is a perfect contract: rain jackets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re cautiously optimistic,\u201d a United Auto Workers striker who referred to himself only as \u201cKeith\u201d told me Wednesday at the entrance to General Motors Hamtramck Assembly. \u201cWe still feel good. We\u2019re waiting to see not just the highlights, but the low lights of this contract as well. If it\u2019s not to our liking? Hey, I got a rain jacket right here.\u201d\n\nA tentative agreement was reached between UAW negotiators and GM on Wednesday, but that doesn\u2019t mean the strike is over. Indeed, ratification could take weeks. But for the workers I spoke to, that doesn\u2019t weaken their resolve to keep going\u2014even as they continue the longest automotive industry strike since 1970 and live with a few hundred dollars a week in strike pay.\n\nThere are few specifics available about the agreement yet as the UAW wants to bring the contract to its members first. But strikers expect to walk the line at least another week as the agreement is first voted on by the UAW GM National Council, who will decide whether to recommend ratification of the contract to union members.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf they do, then all GM UAW members will vote on the contract as a whole. If they don\u2019t, both sides will be back at the bargaining table.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to be out here a day longer than GM,\u201d Striker Mike LeBlanc told me. \u201cWhatever it takes. If it\u2019s voted down, we\u2019ll be out here. If it\u2019s a good contract, we\u2019re ready for it. We have faith in our UAW leaders. A day longer, a day stronger. We\u2019re here to fight for the middle class.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA recommendation by the National Council does not guarantee a thumbs-up vote by the UAW at large, though the UAW does have the option of sending strikers back to work before a vote if the Council approves it.\n\n\n\nEven though workers have been on strike pay, which was recently raised from $250 per week to $275, for a few weeks now, many said they were not feeling any financial pressure and were willing to stay on the line, no matter what.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re good. We prepared for it. You know, the union told us a long time to prepare for this,\u201d Keith said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the ripple effects of this are felt everywhere. More than 50 GM plants in nine states have halted work, as have plants in Canada in Mexico; supplier companies are dealing with slowdowns or layoffs; dealers are finally starting to feel the pinch; the economy in Michigan alone is taking a huge hit. If nothing else, a strike can prove how global and all-encompassing the auto industry is.\n\nFor the workers, however, the strike is a literal fight for the future. They\u2019re working to secure more U.S.-based auto plant jobs at a time when GM production is increasingly shipped to other countries even as the company is handsomely profitable. And they\u2019re working to fix concessions they say they made before the Great Recession, contract provisions that have kept so-called temporary workers from paths to full employment and have kept new workers from the same wages as more senior ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it\u2019s those inequalities that keep the strikers on the line for now, they say.\n\n\u201cWhen they [strike pay checks] start to stack up, then maybe I\u2019ll cash \u2019em,\u201d one striker, who wished to remain anonymous, told me with a laugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA common theme among the strikers, especially the older folks walking the picket line, is that they are getting paid pretty well. Well enough, it seems, to cushion the blow of being out of work for a month with relative ease. Many told me they had been saving up in the event of a strike.\n\nThe purpose of the strike, to them, isn\u2019t to raise their own pay\u2014it\u2019s to help the workers on the lower tier who receive half of what long-timers\u2019 get.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStrikers at the Hamtramck plant feel responsible not only for their fellow workers but for the community at large. Hamtramck Assembly, along with five other plants, including the Lordstown plant in Ohio, is currently slated to be \u201cunallocated.\u201d This would mean basically shuttering the plant, leaving local restaurants and businesses in Detroit\u2019s most densely populated neighborhood in a lurch.\n\nWith a potential agreement with GM on the horizon, strikers are hoping that other workers see their success and start demanding collective bargaining rights of their own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUAW members seem very aware of the organization\u2019s place in history and its role in the creation and stabilization of the middle class in the last century. They see union membership waning in America back to pre-20th-century levels as part of the reason for rising income inequality.\n\nAnd the UAW itself needs a win. In recent years it\u2019s become more known for its corruption scandals up top than how it\u2019s actually represented its workers. This labor action has been the most significant one in the auto industry in half a century, and these workers say they have to make these demands now, when their companies are at last doing well, so they have a stake in what comes next.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis is a historic strike,\u201d Keith said. \u201cOther companies and workers need to learn from this... we need unions.\u201d\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://abc13.com/2-men-found-shot-to-death-just-miles-apart-in-e-harris-co/5400739/", "authors": ["Jeff Ehling"], "title": "2 men found shot to death a couple miles apart in east Harris County", "text": "HCSO in Channelview this morning investigating a shooting the left one person dead and also trying to determine if a second body found a couple of miles away is connected to what happened here. https://t.co/UC6sTIZY1f\n\n(1) @HCSOTexas units are at a shooting scene at 16328 Pecan Street.

(1:13)\n\nINDIANAPOLIS -- Having a chance to sign quarterback Philip Rivers was a \"crazy unique opportunity,\" and one that the Indianapolis Colts couldn't pass up, according to coach Frank Reich.\n\nReich has history with Rivers. He was his quarterbacks coach for a season and then his offensive coordinator for two seasons with the Chargers.\n\n\"Just being there on the inside in the three years that I was and knowing the quarterback position like I do, I was so confident physically he was the right player and he had not lost anything,\" Reich said Tuesday. \"I didn't notice any physical gifts diminishing. From a locker room guy, this guy brings juice ... When I tell you he's elite intellectually, he's at the top. There are a group of guys in the football world I would put in that category -- not everybody gets those gifts. He has them.\"\n\nReich had his eye on Rivers since it became known that the quarterback would become a free agent for the first time in his 16-year NFL career earlier this winter. The coach mentioned his interest in Rivers to general manager Chris Ballard and owner Jim Irsay because he believes the quarterback has what it takes to get them back to the playoffs.\n\nThe coach got his new starting quarterback when the Colts signed Rivers, 38, to a one-year, $25 million deal.\n\n\"Went back and looked at all his film for the last two years and didn't see any physical drop-off in his play, so this was an unique opportunity,\" Reich said. \"It wasn't so much about what Jacoby [Brissett] wasn't doing. It was about an opportunity someone we feel is an elite quarterback and can help our team.\"\n\nRivers' signing ended one of the worst-kept secrets around: that the Colts were going to look to upgrade the quarterback position if the opportunity presented itself. Brissett had started off strong but sputtered dramatically at the end during his first season as Andrew Luck's replacement in 2019.\n\nBrissett was 30th in the NFL with a completion rate at 60.8% as the Colts finished 7-9 and missed the playoffs for the fourth time in five years.\n\nReich called Brissett, who is headed into the final year of his contract, to give him the heads-up that it appeared that they were going to sign Rivers.\n\n\"Honestly, he wasn't happy about it,\" Reich said. \"But he's a great teammate and a great leader, and I'm sure he'll be good. Even though Jacoby isn't a starter, but there's nothing saying he can't play ... We're wide open. [Offensive coordinator] Nick [Sirianni] and I have been talking: What does it look like if Jacoby plays five plays a game? Seven plays a game? We're open to that.\"\n\nSirianni spent five seasons with the Chargers, including two as their quarterbacks coach. Colts tight ends coach Jason Michael also spent time on the Chargers' coaching staff. Reich said Rivers may know more than 85% of his system since the quarterback has run the same one since 2013.\n\nRivers, who has started 224 straight games, has thrown for 59,271 yards and 397 touchdowns to go with eight Pro Bowl invitations in his career. He became the first player in league history to have five straight games with a passer rating of 120 in a single season in 2014.\n\nRivers is joining a team in Indianapolis that's returning an offensive line that started all 16 games last season -- the only team in the NFL to do so -- and a rushing attack that finished in the top 10 in the league.\n\nWhat the Colts can't put up with from Rivers is interceptions. His 20 interceptions were the third most in the league last season.\n\n\"That's unacceptable, and he knows that,\" Reich said. \"Twenty is never good under any circumstance. We want to reduce that number. We think we have the right team around him to get that number down to where it needs to be.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miley-cyrus-pink-floyd-wish-you-were-here-snl_n_5ea5172bc5b6d3763590ccb5", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "title": "Smokin' Miley Cyrus Sings Haunting Pink Floyd's 'Wish You Were Here' On 'SNL'", "text": "Did they get you to trade\n\nYour heroes for ghosts?\n\n...

The Kincade Fire, which started on Oct. 23 near Geyserville and sparked the largest evacuation in Sonoma County history, marks the third consecutive season of massive, destructive wildfires in wine country.\n\nSo far, one winery has been decimated \u2014 Healdsburg\u2019s historic Soda Rock Winery \u2014 by the Kincade conflagration, with four others sustaining damage and other wineries still at risk.\n\nOnly the stone facade of Soda Rock\u2019s 1869 structure and a steel sculpture of a boar \u2014 Lord Snort, a Burning Man artwork \u2014 remained of Ken and Diane Wilson\u2019s winery.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the news. We are devastated,\u201d the winery posted on Facebook before dawn on Oct. 27. Nearly 200 condolences poured in from as far away as New York\u2019s wine country.\n\nLast year\u2019s Mendocino Complex Fire was the largest in California history, burning more than 450,000 acres in four counties, including Mendocino and Lake counties. And 2017\u2019s Atlas and Tubbs fires, which ravaged 23 wineries in Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino counties, continues to haunt vintners. Even after rebuilding \u2014 or quietly dumping a smoke-tainted vintage \u2014 they can feel a wildfire\u2019s impact for years to come.\n\nThe Kincade Fire has burned more than 75,000 acres, according to Cal Fire, and damaged numerous properties, including the Field Stone Vineyard estate and winery located on Highway 128. The property, which is owned by the Jackson family, sustained damage to its barn and winery. It is is home to some of the oldest petite sirah vines in the county.\n\n\u201cWhile the vineyards were threatened by the surrounding fires, we are hopeful that there was no long-term damage,\u201d said Kristen Reitzell, vice president of public relations for Jackson Family Wines. Reitzell would not comment on damages at the Jackson Family estate, but the Press Democrat reports that Jackson Family Wines scion Julia Jackson\u2019s home and numerous buildings on the estate, including the Redwood House, a focal point for entertaining, were gone.\n\nOther vintners, like Medlock Ames, were more fortunate. \u201cLast night the Kincade fire swept quickly through our vineyards at Bell Mountain Ranch and touched almost 75 percent of our property. With the amazing efforts of the first responders, none of the buildings, including our winery, barns and offices, burned,\u201d they wrote on Facebook. \u201cA few vines out of our 55 acres were singed. Our wines were safe in our winery and the remaining 30 tons, which we harvested quickly, were brought to our friends at Saintsbury Winery in Carneros as soon as the evacuation order was given.\u201d\n\nAt this time, the situation remains fluid for the 30-plus wineries and 82 growers in the Alexander Valley. As firefighters work to control a blaze that is only 15 percent contained and spreading east, vintners and winery owners are unable to check on their properties.\n\nIn parts of western Sonoma County, however, evacuation orders were downgraded from \u201cmandatory\u201d to \u201cadvisory\u201d on Tuesday \u2014 sending some vintners home, including the Hafner family of Hafner Vineyard, who reported their return to the winery on Facebook.\n\n\u201cSo, some life may be going back to normal, or so we hope\u2026 This fire came incredibly close for us, and we aren\u2019t out of the woods yet,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut to be on the receiving end of the support and generosity from neighbors is an extraordinarily humbling experience.\u201d\n\nAnother red-flag warning with high winds starts today and will be in effect through Wednesday.

Several neighbors described seeing a recreational vehicle, similar to the one that blew up on Friday morning, in the backyard of the Antioch home for several months before the blast.\n\nDuring an interview on CBS News\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Nashville Mayor John Cooper would not comment on the person of interest but said \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of momentum in the investigation.\u201d\n\nMore than a day after the explosion, AT&T communication networks remained disrupted throughout Tennessee, knocking out residential phones, cellphones and service at 20 call centers for 911. Business and government functions were hobbled, and flights were temporarily grounded at Nashville International Airport.\n\nTony Rodriguez lives in the second home of the duplex in Antioch that law enforcement searched Saturday. He said investigators removed a computer motherboard from his neighbor\u2019s home, among other effects.\n\nRodriguez said he never spoke to his neighbor and didn\u2019t know his name. The few times Rodriguez saw the man, he was tinkering with an antenna above the house and power-washing the driveway behind their home. Rodriguez said the neighbor kept several \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d and warning signs around his property, particularly where he kept the RV.\n\n\u201cHe always seemed like an oddball,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nAuthorities identified Anthony Q. Warner as the man responsible for the Christmas morning bomb that exploded in downtown Nashville. (The Washington Post)\n\nIn a Saturday afternoon news conference in Nashville, FBI Special Agent Douglas Korneski acknowledged that there was \u201cactivity going on\u201d in the Antioch area but that he \u201ccan\u2019t confirm any individuals or anybody we\u2019ve identified.\u201d\n\nThe blast rocked the city around dawn Friday when an RV detonated near an AT&T transmission building on the city\u2019s busy Second Avenue, home to a strip of honky-tonk bars and restaurants.\n\nThe incident \u2014 which officials described as an \u201cintentional act\u201d and \u201cdeliberate bomb\u201d \u2014 left dozens of buildings mangled and sent three people to the hospital with what police said were noncritical injuries.\n\nOfficials said Saturday that the city was safe and that there were no known threats, but the area remained sealed off and under curfew over the weekend as investigators combed through the wreckage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a giant jigsaw puzzle created by a bomb that throws evidence over multiple city blocks,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Donald Cochran. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to gather it, they\u2019ve got to catalogue it, they\u2019ve got to put it back together and find out what the picture of that puzzle looks like.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) asked President Trump for federal assistance in response to the explosion, saying the damage to businesses and the disruptions in Internet and cell service caused by the blast were too severe for the state to handle alone.\n\nThe governor said he spent part of the morning touring the destruction left by the explosion. \u201cThe damage is shocking and it is a miracle that no residents were killed,\u201d Lee wrote in a tweet.\n\nIn a letter to Trump, Lee referred to the incident as an \u201cattack\u201d carried out with a \u201cvehicle-born improvised explosive device,\u201d and he called on the president to issue an emergency disaster declaration, unlocking financial and physical assistance from the federal government.\n\nThe governor estimated that the state had spent at least $175 million responding to other disasters since early 2019 and said federal help was essential.\n\n\u201cThese extraordinary state and local expenditures have reduced our capacity to recover from this current event,\u201d Lee wrote. \u201cGiven these factors, the severity and magnitude of the current situation is such that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local governments.\u201d\n\nThe White House has not publicly responded to Lee\u2019s request. Trump was briefed on the situation Friday and is monitoring developments, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe shocking sequence of events leading to the explosion began before daybreak Friday morning, when residents were startled awake by the crackle of gunfire and called 911. Some later speculated that the noise was a recording intended to wake them up.\n\nShortly afterward, a strange warning began to play from a light-colored, older-model RV parked on Second Avenue.\n\n\u201cIt was a computerized message of \u2018Evacuate now. \u2026 This vehicle has a bomb and will explode,\u2019\u201d said Betsy Williams, who lives in a building adjacent to the blast site. The warning soon changed to a 15-minute countdown, prompting some residents to flee.\n\nPolice arrived at the scene around 6 a.m. local time. They didn\u2019t see any evidence of a shooting, officials said, but saw the RV and called in a bomb squad. A half-dozen officers went door to door telling residents to leave the area, even turning away a man walking his dog.\n\nThe vehicle detonated at 6:30 a.m., spraying debris and ash through the streets and sending a column of flames and smoke curling above rooftops.\n\nNear the spot where the RV was parked on Second Avenue, about 15 people were at the five-story Nashville Downtown Hostel \u2014 a much smaller number than the capacity of about 300 due to the pandemic and Christmas. Unlike some others in the area who evacuated before the blast, the staff and guests at the hostel were unaware of the situation until the blast went off at 6:29 a.m., a time recorded by the building\u2019s closed-circuit television camera.\n\nThe video from the camera, provided by the hostel to The Washington Post, shows a double set of glass doors at the entrance, with \u201cNASHVILLE\u201d printed on them in dark lettering. Three police officers can be seen walking at a steady pace on the street. Moments later, the blast blows out the doors; debris rains down. Flashes of light fill the scene as the concussive force rips across the entryway.\n\nRon Limb, 54, the hostel\u2019s owner, was home in bed, awakened by a call from someone at the hostel. It is one of two such properties he owns in Nashville, a city that he said he fell in love with when he moved from California, attracted by its vibrant culture and youthful outlook. The building began life in the 1880s and once was a candy factory. Limb bought it in 2011, spent a year restoring it, and has since introduced thousands of guests from around the world to his adopted hometown.\n\nLimb said the staff rushed into action.\n\n\u201cThey went around, knocked on every door, got every guest out of the building,\u201d Limb said. \u201cSome were asleep, rushed out in pajamas and underwear, without provisions to deal with the 20-degree weather.\u201d\n\nLimb said fire sprinklers had been activated, causing flooding in the building. Police blocked him from the scene for security reasons, and he spent hours trying to get the city to turn off the water, a task he said was accomplished midday Saturday.\n\nThe area around the blast site remained closed off as agents worked their way inward from the outermost perimeter of the crime scene. A curfew remains in effect for the area through Sunday.\n\nAlthough there were no confirmed fatalities, Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake said in a Friday night news conference that officers found tissue that could be human remains near the explosion that they were preparing to examine. He said police had not identified a suspect or motive. The department released a photo of the RV, which they said arrived on the street at 1:22 a.m. Friday.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, city workers were assisting AT&T in restoring power to the transmission building so cell service could resume, said Nashville Fire Chief William Swann. But it would take one or two days to \u201cget everything back online,\u201d Swann added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big operation with the building itself,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nEfforts were complicated by a fire that reignited in the building Friday night, AT&T said Saturday.\n\nWhen asked by The Post, the communication giant did not share how many customers had been affected by outages, but in a statement, the company announced that it had deployed at least two portable cell sites in downtown Nashville.\n\nThe outage had knocked out service for residents but also disrupted businesses\u2019 ability to process credit cards and communicate, at a time when many are already reeling from the pandemic\u2019s economic fallout.\n\nSoon after the explosion, it became clear that there was another public safety challenge: outages among 911 call centers. Approximately 100 emergency call centers throughout the region faced problems, estimated Brian Fontes, chief executive of the National Emergency Number Association. Disruptions included centers not receiving calls or location data from AT&T Wireless customers.\n\nThe nation\u2019s aging infrastructure of 911 centers can face complications when trying to reroute call traffic after an outage \u2014 especially when the point of failure is one like the transmission building that services a major city.\n\n\u201cI think, if nothing else, there will be a lot of lessons learned from this,\u201d Fontes said.\n\nNashville Mayor John Cooper (D) said that at least 41 businesses were damaged and that \u201cthere will be others as we see the full extent of this.\u201d He said the city would focus on rebuilding but cautioned that it \u201cwill be some time before Second Avenue is back to normal.\u201d\n\nIn his letter to Trump, Lee noted that many of the buildings rocked by the blast were historic and needed to be assessed by an engineer to make sure they are structurally sound.\n\nAs business owners and residents started to take stock of the damage Saturday, a city non-emergency number for people in the affected area remained out of service.\n\n\u201cWe are aware property owners/residents are experiencing difficulties, and are working to resolve them as soon as possible,\u201d Cooper tweeted. \u201cPlease know the explosion impact area is still a federal investigation zone.\u201d\n\nDevlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2020/02/10/social-security-4-quirky-rules-you-should-know-benefits/4692382002/", "authors": [], "title": "4 quirky Social Security rules you need to know to avoid retirement planning mistakes", "text": "Robert Powell\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nIt\u2019s always what you don\u2019t know that can trip you up when planning for retirement. And there\u2019s a lot about Social Security you probably don\u2019t know \u2013 but should.\n\nOr at least you should if you want the largest possible benefit for you and your household. So, what then, are some the quirkiest rules to know?\n\nSpouses and delayed benefits: Married couples are told by Social Security to plan for two lives. So, how might they go about that? Well, let\u2019s say you\u2019re the higher wage earner and you delay starting Social Security until age 70. That will result in you getting the highest monthly benefit for the rest of your life.\n\nSave better, spend better:All the money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox. Sign up here\n\nWhy is this? It\u2019s because Social Security retirement benefits are increased by a certain percentage (depending on date of birth) if you delay your retirement beyond what\u2019s called full retirement age or FRA. FRA is the age at which you could receive an unreduced benefit. But note that the benefit increase no longer applies when you reach age 70, even if you continue to delay taking benefits.\n\nNow, if you wait to apply for Social Security until age 70 you might think your spouse, given the way spousal benefits work, would receive one-half of your age-70 benefit (or more depending on his or her work record and when they file for benefits). But that\u2019s not the case. The benefit for the lower-earning spouse is always a percentage of the higher wage earner\u2019s FRA payment, even if the higher wage earner delayed payments to 70, says Andy Landis, author of \"Inside Social Security.\"\n\nIs your next car a Tesla?Here's what's next from Elon Musk's electric vehicle company\n\nOn the edge?I'm 58 and have no retirement savings. Is my financial life ruined, or is there still hope?\n\nHowever, if the higher wage earner should die, the surviving spouse gets the deceased\u2019s age-70 benefit \u2013 assuming the survivor is at least FRA, says Landis.\n\nSocial Security 2020:4 changes that could affect Social Security\n\nMissing years? Zeroes?:Here are key things to understand about your Social Security statements\n\nSurvivors benefits? For anyone born between 1955 and 1961, there is a difference in FRA for retirement benefits and survivor benefits, says Kurt Czarnowski, a Social Security expert with Czarnowski Consulting.\n\n\u201cFor example, if you were born in 1957, your FRA for retirement benefits is 66 years and six months, while for survivor benefits, it is 66 years and two months,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you were born in 1960, FRA is age 67 for retirement benefits and 66 years and eight months for survivor benefits.\u201d\n\nHere's a link to a chart showing FRA for survivor benefits.\n\nThe other quirky rule, says Czarnowski, is that no matter what your FRA is for survivor benefits, if you start to collect right at age 60, you will always receive 71.5% of what you would receive if you waited until FRA to collect.\n\n\u201cIn other words, survivors benefits that start at age 60 are always reduced by 28.5%, regardless of the person's FRA,\u201d he says.\n\nYou must enroll in Medicare Part A: If you apply for Social Security benefits, you are required to enroll in Medicare Part A, retroactive six months or back to age 65, according to Elaine Floyd, director of retirement and life planning at Horsesmouth, a financial education company. \u201cYou do not have a choice about this,\u201d she says.\n\nAnd, if you\u2019re contributing to a health savings account (HSA), those contributions would have to stop and be withdrawn for any period of retroactivity. \u201cOtherwise, the contributions will be taxable and an annual 6% penalty will be applied to those contributions and the earnings thereon,\u201d says Floyd.\n\nQualify for both retirement and survivors benefits? If you qualify for both a retirement benefit and a survivor benefit, Floyd says you can sequence those benefits for maximum advantage. \u201cFor example, you can start the survivor benefit at age 60 and switch to your own maximum retirement benefit at 70,\u201d she says. \u201cOr you can start your retirement benefit at 62 and switch to your full survivor benefit at FRA. Conditions, such as the earnings test (which applies to all benefits received before FRA for people who work, do apply.\n\nRobert Powell is the editor of TheStreet\u2019s Retirement Daily and contributes regularly to USA TODAY.

The studio will develop a music-themed theatrical narrative feature that Mars will star in and produce. The plot is being kept under wraps, but I\u2019m told that it will consist of mostly original music that he will create and perform.\n\nThis comes in the wake of a precedent-setting deal with Lin-Manuel Miranda for the Hamilton musical film, for which the studio paid $75 million for worldwide rights.

Integral in the Mars deal was Mitchell Leib, who heads music for the film group.\n\nMars previously appeared in Honeymoon in Vegas and was a featured voice in Rio 2.

There will be a trial, which will no doubt deepen our national polarization. And henceforth, in the history books, Trump will go down as an impeached president \u2014 one of a precious few.\n\nOr at least, a precious few for now. The count isn\u2019t apt to stay small in coming decades.\n\nThere was only one impeachment, Andrew Johnson\u2019s, in the first century of constitutional governance. There wasn\u2019t another one for a century after that, with President Richard Nixon and Watergate. Knowing he would almost certainly be impeached in the House and convicted in the Senate, Nixon spared the nation by resigning.\n\nIt was another quarter-century until President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment and acquittal by the Senate. That was 20 years ago. But it won\u2019t be two decades until the next one. Bank on it.\n\nThat is because Trump\u2019s impeachment is the one the Framers feared. It is a straight-party-line impeachment, based on misconduct that is so nebulous and inconsequential that Democrats changed their theory of criminality multiple times (\u201cquid pro quo,\u201d campaign finance, extortion, bribery) until finally settling on no crime at all, accusing the president of \u201cabuse of power.\u201d\n\nThis new standard is so amorphous, it could be applied to any president. Every president, after all, abuses the awesome powers of the office from time to time, and the opposition party always cries, \u201cCorruption!\u201d\n\nNow, no one will be satisfied with cries. The base of the party out of power will expect its representatives in Congress to impeach the president, particularly if they have the raw numbers to get it done in the House.\n\nThe Framers understood that a congressional impeachment power was \u201cindispensable,\u201d as James Madison put it. It was needed to discourage executive overreach and strip power if egregious instances of it demonstrated that the president was unfit.\n\nTheir fears about abuse of power, though, weren\u2019t confined to the presidency. Their major worry was the accumulation of too much power in the hands of any organ of government. Impeachment might give the Congress too much power over the chief executive. It might invite partisans to impeach a president on trivial grounds, for sheer political advantage.\n\nsee also Pelosi warns Dems to refrain from gloating during impeachment proceedings Pelosi and other Democratic leaders told their members not to...\n\nBecause of those concerns, our government was designed to make impeachment difficult to carry out. The Framers adopted a standard of \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d in an effort to highlight that comparatively minor acts of misconduct and maladministration were insufficiently grave to trigger impeachment and all the upheaval that accompanies it.\n\nMore practically, they required a supermajority for conviction and removal, two-thirds of the Senate. This would mean that no president could be stripped of power absent misconduct so abominable that a public consensus for removal would form, such that two-thirds of senators would be moved to transcend ties of party, ideology and loyalty.\n\nThis supermajority requirement was to have a sobering effect on the House, too. Unless presidential malfeasance was sufficiently serious that there was a reasonable chance the Senate would vote to remove, the House would be dissuaded from impeaching in the first place. Members of Congress could expect to be punished at the ballot box for needlessly putting the country through a futile impeachment.\n\nThat\u2019s gone now. There is a new kind of politics in America, one we will come to regret. The theory is that elections are won not by broadening a coalition, reaching out to attract or convincing opponents and undecideds. No, they are won by stoking grievance on one\u2019s own side and electrifying one\u2019s base \u2014 which is never more united and enthusiastic than when it opposes a political enemy.\n\nSo Democrats will impeach Trump, not because they believe they can remove him, but because they think branding him with the scarlet \u201cI\u201d is a promising 2020 campaign strategy.\n\nIf it can be done to Trump, it can be done to the next president and the next and the next. \u2026 And now, each party\u2019s base will demand that it be done. If each side doesn\u2019t impeach the enemy\u2019s president, it will mean their partisans in the House aren\u2019t trying hard enough.\n\nTrump will survive. Electorally speaking, impeachment may even benefit him, if the public comes to see Democrats as having abused their impeachment power. But our country will be the worse for it.\n\nAndrew C.

Data for May was revised slightly down to show retail sales increasing 0.4%, instead of increasing 0.5% as previously reported.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales edging up 0.1% in June. Compared to June last year, retail sales advanced 3.4%.\n\nExcluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales jumped 0.7% last month after an upwardly revised 0.6% increase in May. These so-called core retail sales, which correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, were previously reported to have increased 0.4% in May.\n\nJune's strong gain in core retail sales, coming on the heels of solid increases in April and May, suggested a sharp acceleration in consumer spending in the second quarter.\n\nConsumer spending grew at its slowest pace in a year in the first quarter. Spending is being supported by a tight labor market, even as the broader economy is slowing as weaker business investment, an inventory overhang, a trade war between the United States and China, and softening global growth pressure the manufacturing sector.\n\nThe data probably will have little impact on market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this month for the first time in a decade. But signs of strong consumer spending and rising core inflation suggest the U.S. central bank is unlikely to cut rates by 50 basis points at its July 30-31 policy meeting as markets had initially anticipated.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell last week told lawmakers the central bank would \"act as appropriate\" to protect the economy against risks stoked by a trade war between the United States and China, as well as slowing global growth.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increased at a 1.4% annualized rate in the second quarter.

If we're not in college, we're not having contests,\" Bowlsby said. \"Our message was, we need to get universities and colleges back open, that we were education-based programs, and we weren't going to have sports until we had something closer to normal college going on.\"\n\nThe call happened after President Donald Trump told reporters he would speak with various leaders and commissioners from sports leagues about eventually reopening the country when the coronavirus pandemic is contained.\n\nIf the students aren\u2019t allowed back on campus until next January, the college football season could begin at that point according to one scenario.\n\nHowever, Clemson Athletic Director Dan Radakovich sees challenges with that approach. Appearing on Mickey Plyler\u2019s show Tuesday, Radakovich said that playing in the spring would be difficult.\n\n\"Spring football brings a host of opportunities and challenges,\" said Radakovich. \"Like it or not, college football is tied to the NFL. The NFL has done this before in labor stoppages and playing shortened seasons and playing seven or eight games, playoffs and Super Bowl and then starting their next year...I think it would be very difficult, especially for the young men with NFL aspirations to be playing a spring football league while the NFL is moving into their 2021 year. We can play. It may not be with the same people we\u2019re looking at playing with this fall because they could be looking at NFL opportunities because the NFL would continue to march on.\n\n\"That\u2019s why the idea of making sure we\u2019re completing with our football season and our championship prior to the start of the 2021 NFL year I think is really, really important.

Anything else is just not. That\u2019s about as easy as I can say it.\"\n\nRadakovich went on to say that a concern among his colleagues is if fans will return to the stands in numbers in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\"Will everyone come back? We hope they will come back. But there is that school of thought that, 'Will it be as it has been the last few years?'\" Radakovich said, adding that their focus is on making the right decision and not the quickest.\n\nMany thanks to VP @Mike_Pence for taking the time to talk to the commissioners today about college football and protecting the health of our students.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests applying \"a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area\" and continuing to use your arm, as usual, to help reduce any pain. Even though a little discomfort is normal, the CDC says you should contact your healthcare provider if the redness or tenderness in the spot you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours. The CDC also suggests consulting your doctor about taking over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you are experiencing significant pain.\n\nWhile talking to CNN, Fauci also took the opportunity to assure the public that there was no safety risk in getting the shot\u2014and that it in fact would help move everything forward. \"I feel very confident about what we're doing and that's the reason why I strongly recommend to everybody and everyone that when the vaccine becomes available to them to get vaccinated,\" he told Blitzer.\n\n\"That is how we're going to put this pandemic behind us,\" he concluded.\n\nBut just as Fauci is anticipating some pain in his upper arm, there are some side effects of the COVID vaccine that the CDC wants you to prepare for.

But while his hook-handed visage has joined the ranks of horror movie icons, his backstory is more complicated than most of Hollywood\u2019s iconic slasher villains.\n\nIn the latest look at the Candyman remake, due out later in 2020, his unsettling past is explained in a haunting puppet show.\n\nCANDYMAN, at the intersection of white violence and black pain, is about unwilling martyrs. The people they were, the symbols we turn them into, the monsters we are told they must have been. https://t.co/MEwwr8umdI\n\nIn the original Candyman movie from 1992, adapted from a Clive Barker short story, the Candyman was once the son of a slave who became wealthy by making shoes. Before he was the Candyman, he was an artist that was accepted by white society and frequently painted portraits of wealthy families. However, when he began a relationship with a white woman, her father hired a mob to chase him from his house, cut off his hand, and smeared honey on him so bees would sting him as he was burned.\n\nIn a new prelude/trailer, shared on Twitter by the remake\u2019s director, Nia DaCosta, this is just one of the horrifying stories that seems to be told. Except, rather than showing the stories or explaining them like the original movie, the trailer imagines each tale with paper puppets. Each of the stories plays out without any dialog, with only a haunting slow version of Philip Glass\u2019 \u201dHelen\u2019s Theme\u201d from the original movie playing quietly in the background as each of the puppets is killed.\n\nThe trailer begins with a black man who seems to be walking back from his job at a candy factory. When police see him offer candy to children, they chase him down and beat him. Another story shows a small black boy accused of some crime by a white girl, whatever the crime, a faceless and indifferent jury sentences the child to die by the electric chair.

The U.S. is against it", "text": "The emblem of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) at the court's entrance in Hamburg, Germany. Patrick Lux | AFP | Getty Images\n\nChina has nominated a Chinese candidate for a judge's position in an international tribunal that settles maritime disputes. But the U.S. is seeking to stop China, arguing that Beijing has flouted international sea laws in the disputed South China Sea. \"Electing a PRC official to this body is like hiring an arsonist to help run the Fire Department,\" said David Stilwell, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, at an online forum held by think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies last month. PRC refers to the People's Republic of China, the official name of the country. \"We urge all countries involved in the upcoming International Tribunal election to carefully assess the credentials of the PRC candidate and consider whether a PRC judge on the Tribunal will help or hinder international maritime law. Given Beijing's record, the answer should be clear,\" he added. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea is expected to hold an election in August or September to select seven judges to serve a nine-year term. All 168 signatories of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, or UNCLOS, will cast their votes in the election.\n\nThe UNCLOS is an international treaty that outlines nations' rights and responsibilities in the world's ocean space. It forms the basis for how international courts, such as the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, settle maritime disputes. In 2016, a tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration dismissed China's claims of nearly 90% of the South China Sea as baseless according to UNCLOS principles. China, which negotiated and ratified the convention, refused to accept or recognize the ruling.\n\nThe next time a China Coast Guard ship plays chicken with an oil rig off Vietnam or a flotilla of Chinese fishing boats appears in Indonesian waters, the United States will likely speak up more forcefully to decry the illegal action. Greg Poling Center for Strategic and International Studies\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. is not allowed to vote in the tribunal election because it has not ratified the convention. That's a point raised by Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman at China's foreign ministry, who disputed Stilwell's arguments. \"So far, the United States has not ratified the UNCLOS, but has always posed as a defender of it,\" Hua said at a regular media conference by the ministry last month after she was asked for her comments. \"Judges of the Tribunal perform their duties in their personal capacity,\" she said, defending her country's candidate as one who's \"well versed in international law and the law of the sea,\" according to an official transcript released on the ministry's website.\n\nThe U.S. gets tougher on China\n\nIt's not the first time that China has put up a candidate for the election of judges for the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. In fact, three Chinese judges have served at the judicial body since the first election was held in 1996, according to the tribunal's website. But the U.S. brought attention to China's latest nomination as it toughened its stance against continued Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, a resource-rich waterway that's a vital shipping lane for global trade.\n\nStilwell's comments at the CSIS forum came a day after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called China's claims to \"offshore resources\" in the South China Sea \"completely unlawful.\" The U.S. has long promoted freedom of navigation by air and sea across the waterway. However, China claims nearly all of South China Sea, an area encompassing about 1.4 million square miles, that stretches from Singapore to the Straits of Taiwan. China backs up its claims and activities in the sea \u2014 including drilling for oil and creating artificial islands \u2014 with a vague \"nine-dash line\" that it said delineated Chinese historical territory in olden maps. The nine-dash line, which overlaps with territorial claims by several parties, was dismissed in the 2016 tribunal ruling. According to UNCLOS, coastal states have sovereign rights to national resources within 200 nautical miles from their shores, and can conduct certain economic activities and maritime research within that area. The area marked out by the nine-dash line stretches far beyond 200 nautical miles from China's coast.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.crimeonline.com/2019/08/22/graphic-video-white-stand-your-ground-shooter-kills-unarmed-black-man-father-of-four-over-a-handicapped-parking-spot/", "authors": ["Jacquelyn Gray"], "title": "GRAPHIC VIDEO: White \u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 shooter kills unarmed black man, father of four over a handicapped parking spot", "text": "A Florida man is currently standing trial for last year\u2019s shooting death of a man in what reportedly stemmed from a dispute over a parking spot.\n\nMichael Drejka, 49, is facing manslaughter charges for fatally shooting Markeis McGlockton, 28, outside of a Clearwater convenience store parking lot on July 19, 2018. While Drejka\u2019s attorneys are claiming he acted in self-defense after McGlockton pushed him to the ground and his girlfriend threatened him, prosecutors said McGlockton was turning away from Drejka when he shot him in the chest, according to CNN.\n\nThe news network noted that both the defense and prosecution have claimed that surveillance footage showing the shooting proves their side of the story.\n\n***WARNING: The video below depicts violence and could be disturbing to some viewers.

She said she pulled into the handicap spot with McGlockton and their children when McGlockton went into the store to get snacks.\n\nJacobs alleged Drejka was walking around her car, prompting her to roll down her window. An argument ensued when Drejka questioned her about why she was in the parking spot, she said.\n\nJacobs reportedly asked Drejka if he wanted her to get her boyfriend. She claimed she made the comment in hopes of scaring Drejka\u2014but he ended up telling her that he should get her boyfriend if she wanted to fight.\n\nJacobs and McGlockton have four children\u2014one who was born after his death. Jacobs was reportedly three months pregnant at the time of the July 2018 shooting.\n\n\u201cI just wanted this man to leave me alone,\u201d she said of Drejka, according to NBC News. \u201cLeave me and my babies alone.\u201d\n\nThe first witness the prosecution called to the stand was Richard Kelly, a septic company employee who described an encounter he had with Drejka in the same parking lot in February 2018, months before the fatal altercation with McGlockton.\n\nAccording to WFTS, Kelly testified that Drejka threatened him for parking in the handicap spot but he didn\u2019t pull a weapon on him. Drejka explained that he wasn\u2019t disabled but his mother-in-law was. The disagreement reportedly calmed down when the convenience store owner came out to the parking lot and Kelly left.\n\nOn Wednesday, Kelly\u2019s boss, John Tyler, took the stand and testified that Drejka called him to complain about Kelly parking in the handicap spot. Tyler alleged that Drejka said Kelly was lucky.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018If I had a gun, I could have shot him,\u2019\u201d Tyler testified, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nThe case has brought additional scrutiny to Florida\u2019s \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d law. Under the statute, someone is allowed to use lethal force if they \u201creasonably believe that using or threatening to use such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony.\u201d\n\nCNN reported that the law doesn\u2019t protect a person who instigated the use of force, unless they\u2019ve exhausted every other option to retreat or escape. The defense hasn\u2019t cited the controversial law as part of their argument, but are claiming this is a classic case of self-defense.\n\nDefense attorney Bryant Camareno said in the span of 11 seconds, McGlockton made a \u201cbeeline\u201d toward Drejka and pushed him before he was shot, according to ABC News. He also criticized prosecutors for suggesting Drejka had a history of parking lot altercations, adding that neither Tyler or Kelly called the police on him.\n\nThe high-profile trial, which is in its fourth day, is expected to continue for two to three weeks.\n\nFor the latest true crime and justice news, subscribe to the \u2018Crime Stories with Nancy Grace\u2019 podcast.

The infection showed up as early as December 18th in those samples.\n\nItaly\u2019s local transmission started on February 21st when the first domestic case was diagnosed. The number of cases surged for weeks as authorities struggled to contain the virus.\n\nThe novel coronavirus started spreading in China in late December, according to official reports. A few weeks later, human transmission was confirmed, bringing our worst fears to life. In the months that followed, the deadly virus spread to every corner of the world. Even as China began to get the Wuhan epicenter under control, other massive outbreaks emerged in Europe and then in the United States.\n\nHowever, that might not be the full story. China has recently confirmed that the virus\u2019s origin isn\u2019t the Wuhan market or the Wuhan lab, which has been at the center of multiple conspiracy theories. China still won\u2019t say where the first cases appeared or, more importantly, when. Geneticists indicated that the virus may have started spreading in China as early as October. Other researchers discovered increased parking activity in five Wuhan hospitals as early as August or September, consistent with the emergence of a new disease.\n\nSeparately, researchers from Italy, France, and America were able to prove that some COVID-19 cases appeared in those countries well before community transmission skyrocketed. The newest data from Italy tells us the virus was present in the country at least two months before Italy got its first local case.\n\nItalian scientists studied samples from sewage water in Italy and discovered genetic virus traces in Milan and Turin dating back to December 18th. These are two major Italian cities situated in the northern region of the country, where Italy\u2019s main COVID-19 outbreak started. The country was the world\u2019s COVID-19 epicenter for weeks starting in mid-February. The number of cases surged despite strict lockdowns and social distancing measures, and Italy quickly surpassed China\u2019s reported number of COVID-19 patients and deaths.\n\nItaly\u2019s first cases were a pair of Chinese tourists who tested positive in Rome on January 31st. But the country\u2019s first local case emerged on February 21st in the town of Codogno in Lombardy. Codogno was closed off, as were nine others in Lombardy and Veneto, and the entire country locked down in early March. This didn\u2019t prevent the disease from spreading uncontrollably. Since the local epidemic started, more than 34,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Italy, one of the world\u2019s worst death tolls. Italy has registered over 238,000 cases to date.\n\nThe conclusions of Italy\u2019s National Institute of Health (ISS) indicate that the virus reached Europe much earlier than the first signs of sustained community transmission. This is in line with previous research from other Italian scientists.\n\nFrench doctors found evidence of a COVID-19 case that was treated in a Parisian hospital on December 27th. A different team found CT results showing the same type of lung damage that appears in COVID-19 pneumonia dating back to mid-November. American researchers suspect that at least one person may have been infected as early as late December, with the CDC indicating recently that community transmission started weeks before the previous estimate.\n\nISS examined 40 sewage samples from wastewater treatment plants in Italy between October and February, BBC explains. The samples from October and November turned out to be negative. Wastewater from Bologna, a city between Milan and Rome, started showing traces of the virus in January.\n\nThe research did not \u201cautomatically imply that the main transmission chains that led to the development of the epidemic in our country originated from these very first cases,\u201d ISS water quality expert Giuseppina La Rosa said.\n\nThe findings suggest the \u201cstrategic importance\u201d of sewage water for early detection, as it can signal the virus\u2019s presence before extensive transmission is present. The ISS plans to start monitoring wastewater at tourist resorts starting in July and will set up a nationwide wastewater monitoring network later this year.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fitch-cuts-outlook-boeing-negative-134446305.html", "authors": ["Sanjana"], "title": "Fitch, Moody's cut Boeing's debt outlook to 'negative' on 737 MAX problems", "text": "By Sanjana Shivdas\n\n(Reuters) - Fitch Ratings and Moody's lowered their outlooks for Boeing Co <BA.N> to \"negative\" from \"stable\" on Monday, citing delays in its 737 MAX jets' return to service.\n\nThe revision, which comes on the heels of Boeing's nearly $5 billion charge related to the grounding, could potentially increase borrowing costs for the world's largest planemaker.\n\nBoth the ratings agencies, however, retained their investment grade credit rating on Boeing debt, given the company's liquidity, financial flexibility and dominant position in the market.

A giant screen was installed outside.\n\nThe stirring ceremony, with readings that included a poem by Albert Camus to his own teacher, came hours after the prosecutor sketched out how the teenager came to kill Paty, with the suspected help of two young students at the school in a northwest Paris suburb.\n\nJean-Francois Ricard said a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old are among seven people taken before an investigating magistrate on accusations of \u201ccomplicity in murder in relation with a terrorist undertaking\u201d and \u201ccriminal conspiracy.\u201d\n\nThe killer offered students at the school where Paty taught 300-350 euros ($355-$415) to help him pick out the educator, Ricard said during a news conference.\n\n\u201cThe investigation has established that the perpetrator knew the name of the teacher, the name of the school and its address, yet he did not have the means to identify him,\" the prosecutor said. \"That identification has only been possible with the help of students from the same school.\u201d\n\nHe said the implication of the two young adolescents \u201cappeared to be conclusive.\u201d\n\nAuthorities have identified the killer as Abdoullakh Anzorov., a Moscow-born Chechen refugee.\n\nAnzorov claimed responsibility in a text accompanied by a photograph of the victim found on his phone.\n\nThe other suspects include a student's father who posted videos on social media that called for mobilization against the teacher and an Islamist activist who helped the man disseminate the virulent messages, which named Paty and gave the school's address, Ricard said.\n\nTwo more men, aged 18 and 19, are accused of accompanying the attacker when he bought the weapons, including a knife and an airsoft gun, the prosecutor said. One of them allegedly drove Anzorov, who lived in the Normandy town of Evreux about 90 kilometers (56 miles) of the school, to near the school about three hours before the killing.\n\nAnother 18-year-old suspect had close contacts with the attacker and endorsed radical Islamism, Ricard said.\n\nAl three of them, who were friends of Anzorov, allegedly said that \"he was \u2018radicalizing\u2019 for several months, marked by a change of behavior, physical appearance, isolation, an assiduous frequentation of the mosque and ambiguous remarks about Jihad and the Islamic State group.\u201d\n\n\u201cSamuel Paty was the victim of a conspiracy of stupidity, hate, lies ... hate of the other ... hate of what we profoundly are,\" Macron said during his speech, which blended honors to the victim and the teaching profession with his government's efforts to root out Islamist radicals.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the French government issued an order to dissolve a domestic militant Islamic group, the Collective Cheikh Yassine. Government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said it was \u201cimplicated, linked to Friday\u2019s attack\u201d and it was used to promote anti-republican hate speech. Other groups will be dissolved \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d for similar reasons, Attal said.\n\nNamed after a slain leader of the Palestinian Hamas, Collective Cheikh Yassine was founded in the early 2000s by the Islamist activist who is among the seven people accused of being accomplices to the attacker.\n\nAttal also confirmed that the government ordered a mosque in the northeast Paris suburb of Pantin to close for six months.\n\nThe Pantin mosque is being punished for relaying the angry father\u2019s message on social media.\n\nAuthorities say it has long had an imam following the Salafist path, a rigorous interpretation of the Muslim holy book.\n\nA national memorial event is scheduled to be held Wednesday evening in the courtyard of the Sorbonne university.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nElaine Ganley in Paris contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.si.com/nfl/broncos/news/fangio-cites-two-areas-as-evidence-that-drew-lock-has-developed", "authors": [], "title": "Fangio Cites Two Areas as Evidence That Drew Lock has Developed", "text": "Drew Lock is coming off the 14th start of his young NFL career. The Denver Broncos came a lot to closer to beating the Kansas City Chiefs than they have in the last three games but still came up short on Sunday 22-16.\n\nLock went 15-of-28 (53.5%) for 151 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions. After his first pick, which came on Denver's opening drive, he settled in, similarly to his last start vs. the Miami Dolphins, and mostly played an efficient brand of quarterback.\n\nThe second interception came on the Broncos' final possession of the game on a 4th- & -5 with no timeouts and 33 seconds to go, punctuating his Week 13 performance perfectly. Such has been the story for Lock this season; one step forward, two steps back, then two steps forward, one step back.\n\nHe's now 7-7 as an NFL starter. But the critics have come out of the woodwork, perhaps due in part to Lock's role in the Broncos' Week 12 travesty of a football game in which the team was strong-armed to play by the NFL without a true QB (thanks to Lock's imperfect mask-wearing discipline).\n\nHis worst critics say that not only has Lock not progressed this year, he's done the opposite; regressed. What does head coach Vic Fangio say on the issue of whether Lock has produced any evidence of development in Year 2?\n\nFirst off, Fangio is tired of the turnovers. Barring that, the coach pointed to two key areas as evidence of Lock developing.\n\n\u201cWe've got to cut down on the interceptions, obviously,\" Fangio said on Monday. \"We just need to see the continued improved play and I think converting the third downs last night showed that a little bit. We had a good day in the red zone\u2014that shows development in a quarterback. Just need to make good throws, good plays, good reads, run the offense from the start of the huddle to the line of scrimmage. We're not always spot on right there and we need to be.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Broncos? Don't miss out on any news and analysis! Take a second and sign up for our FREE newsletter and get breaking Broncos news delivered to your inbox daily!\n\nLock's Broncos went 7-of-13 on third down (57%) at Arrowhead Stadium and a perfect 2-for-2 in the red zone. Lock was responsible for both touchdowns in the red zone, with the second being both a great pass and a great catch by Tim Patrick, who tippy-toed in for the score.\n\nThe Broncos entered Week 13's matchup with the Chiefs converting a sorry 36.1% on third down (ranked 30th) and just 48.2% in the red zone (30th). Red zone efficiency is determined by how many touchdowns are produced on possessions that reach at least the opponent's 20-yard line.\n\nThat is an improvement and it is evidence that things might be clicking for Lock. But it's far from definitive proof.\n\nMaybe Lock's improved play in these key areas was an outlier. We'll find out in the remaining four games. Fangio steadfastly believes Lock will do just that.\n\n\"I think Drew has got it in him and we're going to keep working with him on that,\" Fangio said.\n\nAlthough it might be a biased view, Lock believes things are clicking better for him. With a new offensive coordinator in Pat Shurmur that did not come with the traditional offseason reps to assimilate the scheme for Lock thanks to the pandemic \u2014 which canceled OTAs and the preseason, erasing upwards of 1,400-1,600 reps \u2014 it's possible that the second-year quarterback simply needed the time on task to gel with his new play-caller.\n\n\"Personally, I feel like I'm seeing it,\" Lock said post-game in Kansas City. \"So, I try to see it better and better each week. I know I've been seeing it, of course when you're seeing it with your own eyes, but feeling the game\u2014dealing with what these defenses are doing and how they're trying to stop us. Definitely farther along and feel better than I did a year ago coming here.\"\n\nIt could be 'quarterback-speak' or even empty platitudes from a frustrated player. But as a student of the game, I would concur that Lock has shown modest improvement in Year 2 in certain areas.\n\nThe frustrating thing about it, though, is that he's also shown regression in other areas, specifically in his footwork/technique and decision-making. Last year, Broncos' ex-OC Rich Scangarello did a good job of coaching Lock to not repeat mistakes. For whatever Scangarello lacked as a tactician in the Xs and Os department he seemed to more than make up for as a teacher and QB developer.\n\nShurmur and QBs Coach Mike Shula have not had the same success in helping Lock to avoid repeatedly stepping in the same pitfalls. I attribute that more to the lack of reps and time on task together than anything, but it is alarming to put it mildly.\n\nLock will get four more games to make his case to Fangio and the Broncos' front office that he should get 2021 as one last audition to be the future franchise guy. Steady improvement, eliminating the same old costly mistakes (turnovers), and better consistency is what it'll take to secure that benefit of the doubt.\n\nIt's possible it doesn't happen and the Broncos opt to go a different direction at quarterback next year. It's equally possible, maybe even more so, that GM John Elway is inclined to view 2020 as a 'mulligan' type of season for both Fangio and Lock alike, considering all the outlier conditions and mitigating factors of this pandemic-influenced campaign.\n\nTime will tell.\n\nFollow Chad on Twitter @ChadNJensen and @MileHighHuddle.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://pagesix.com/2020/05/06/we-hear-episode-72-whats-next-for-scott-disick-after-rehab-reveal/", "authors": ["May"], "title": "What\u2019s next for Scott Disick after rehab reveal", "text": "Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)\n\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\n\nSubscribe on:\n\n\u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d star Scott Disick cut his rehab stint short after photos of him at the facility were made public.

Marshall was an influential owner -- he helped foster the evolution of the forward pass and embraced television in the 1950s, allowing the franchise to become the most dominant team in the South.\n\nBut Marshall resisted efforts and pressure to integrate his roster, becoming the last NFL owner to do so in 1962. Marshall once said he would sign African American players when the Harlem Globetrotters signed white players. The Redskins were the southernmost franchise, and Marshall had their marching band play \"Dixie\" on the field for 23 years. The NAACP protested against Marshall at a meeting of league owners in 1957 and once picketed outside his home.\n\nFor years, columnists wrote about the lack of Black players on Washington's roster, but it didn't deter Marshall. In the spring of 1961, however, Interior Secretary Stewart Udall started to apply pressure on Marshall to integrate his roster. NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle later got involved in trying to persuade Marshall to relent. He was quoted in stories wondering why, if \"[a]ll the other teams we play have Negroes, does it matter which team has the Negroes?\" That December, Marshall drafted Black running back and Heisman Trophy winner Ernie Davis with the first pick. But it was later learned that Marshall had traded the selection to the Cleveland Browns in exchange for Mitchell, a running back/receiver who became Washington's first Black player in 1962.\n\nD.C. Stadium was later renamed RFK Stadium; the Redskins moved to FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, in 1997. With the lease on the land at FedEx ending in 2027, the Redskins have been seeking a new home in the Washington area. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has said multiple times that she'd like the team to return to the District. However, she reiterated a roadblock for that return in a recent interview with The Team 980: their nickname.\n\n\"It's an obstacle for us locally, but it's also an obstacle for the federal government who leases the land to us,\" Bowser said.\n\nOwner Dan Snyder said in 2013 he would never change the name, a stance others within the franchise have repeated in subsequent years.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.si.com/nfl/2020/09/24/mahomes-jackson-draft-prospects-cam-newton-khalil-mack-trade", "authors": ["Albert Breer"], "title": "Revisiting Lamar Jackson and Patrick Mahomes as Draft Prospects", "text": "Before two of the most electric quarterbacks in the NFL meet in Week 3, Albert Breer looks back at how they were evaluated coming out of school, what other teams missed and what we can learn. Plus, power rankings, why the Patriots should extend Cam Newton now and reassessing the Khalil Mack trade.\n\nThe Ravens weren\u2019t going to do a thing to tip their interest in Lamar Jackson. In fact, much was done to cover it up in 2018\u2014they even brought Louisville\u2019s Heisman winner to Baltimore on the last day predraft visits were allowed by NFL rules, in hopes that the summit would fly under the radar and other teams wouldn\u2019t get to ask Jackson about his experience there. Which, in its own way, was a tell on the reality of the situation.\n\nConversely, within a small group inside the building, the work on Jackson was intense.\n\nThe reason why was right there in plain sight for anyone with a cable subscription in the autumns of 2015 and \u201916. The kid brought an undeniable playmaking ability to the table. He\u2019d thrown for 7,203 yards and 57 touchdowns, and rushed for 3,172 yards and another 41 touchdowns in his final two seasons as a Cardinal, winning the Heisman as a sophomore, and besting his \u201915 numbers as a junior.\n\nThe plan for inserting Jackson into an NFL offense had to be complex. Deploying him in a conventional offense would be like playing Deion Sanders in zone, or dropping J.J. Watt into coverage. Could you do it? Maybe. But you wouldn\u2019t get the most out of him playing that way.\n\nSo John Harbaugh gathered then OC Marty Mornhinweg, QBs coach James Urban and tight ends coach Greg Roman that April, and asked them for a detailed plan to answer the question: If we draft Lamar Jackson, how will we use him?\n\nCarlos Miguel Saavedra/Sports Illustrated\n\nLong story short, that\u2019s how the post\u2013Joe Flacco Baltimore offense was born. Mornhinweg, Urban and Roman assembled a plan; the coaches presented it to GM Ozzie Newsome, GM to be Eric DeCosta and the scouts; and Baltimore traded back into the first round to get him. Then, when Flacco got hurt during Jackson\u2019s supposed \u201credshirt\u201d year, that plan was put into motion ahead of schedule. An MVP award later, the rest is history.\n\nOn Monday, the NFL will get a reminder of how many people missed on all this.\n\nThat Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson were first-round picks shows that the league did, indeed, recognize the off-the-charts production of the two quarterbacks as collegians. That Mahomes went 10th and Jackson 32nd, on the other hand, shows us something else: Some franchises have moved their organizations forward through a time of a lot of change in football, and others haven\u2019t.\n\nAnd, really, that can be boiled down to that simple thought Harbaugh had that April: Here\u2019s a great player. How would we use him?\n\nSince, the Ravens have shown everyone how.\n\n***\n\nWe\u2019re back for Week 3, and in this week\u2019s GamePlan we\u2019re bringing you \u2026\n\n\u2022 Power rankings!\n\n\u2022 Why New England should extend Cam Newton \u2026 now.\n\n\u2022 How the Raiders might be winning the Khalil Mack trade.\n\nBut we\u2019re starting with a look at the MVP quarterbacks facing off Monday night, by taking a look back.\n\n***\n\nI was talking to an exec with an AFC team on Wednesday who\u2019d checked out our podcast with Chiefs GM Brett Veach over the summer and heard Veach reference watching the 2015 Texas Bowl as the moment he got religion on Mahomes. After listening, this veteran evaluator decided to pull up that game\u2014LSU vs. Texas Tech\u2014as an exercise, to see what he might\u2019ve missed ahead of the 2017 draft.\n\nIt was a lot, as it turned out.\n\n\u201cIt was a freak show\u2014he was ripping the ball, and I can see why you\u2019d watch that and say, How\u2019d this dude fall to 10?\u201d said the exec. \u201cYou got Deion Jones, Tre\u2019Davious White, Jamal Adams, [Kevin] Toliver running around. LSU had so many dudes. And it\u2019s him against the world. Running away from the rush. Throwing against his body. He\u2019s got this cannon of an arm, and he\u2019s holding them in the game by himself.\u201d\n\nAnd then, the exec snapped back to what the reality of the situation was at the time.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d had to be a big-balls mother------ to take him with, say, the fourth pick if you were Jacksonville at the time\u2014balls like grapefruits,\u201d he continued. \u201cKansas City could do it. They had Alex [Smith]. They had the infrastructure to develop him. They were already winning. Great situation. Great call by them. All the credit to Veach for seeing what a lot of us didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe predraft cases for Jackson and Mahomes were different, to be sure.\n\nThe issue with Mahomes was a free-wheeling style that clouded his evaluation, a daring looseness with the ball that led some to believe he\u2019d be a turnover waiting to happen in the pros, and an offense that routinely churned out cartoonish passing numbers, even with average quarterbacks at the helm. With Jackson, it was how reliant Louisville was on his legs, and whether his frame\u2014he\u2019s not built like Cam Newton or Tim Tebow\u2014would hold up if he had to run that much in the NFL, plus his ability to pick up a pro offense.\n\nThat stuff is right there in my notes from the April of their draft years. On Mahomes, one AFC QBs coach said to me, \u201cHe has the best wrist of any of them, he flicks the ball, puts it wherever he wants it. And he\u2019s smart enough. That system\u2019s different obviously, but he gets their system and can learn what he doesn\u2019t know. Now, there\u2019s gonna be a major learning curve.\u201d And on Jackson, an AFC OC said, \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a lot of projection there on how much he can or can\u2019t improve. He\u2019s a great athlete. But you\u2019re drafting a quarterback.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to the one big similarity in their predraft cases: The teams that took them were focused not on what Mahomes and Jackson couldn\u2019t do, but what they could do.\n\n***\n\nTo be fair, there were built-in advantages Baltimore and Kansas City had ahead of drafting those guys. Like the exec above said, it would have taken some stomach to draft one of the two into disjointed situations without the infrastructure to develop them correctly.\n\nVeach knew he\u2019d be dropping Mahomes off to Andy Reid, and onto a roster where he wouldn\u2019t need to play right away and one that would support him when that time came, with a veteran line and explosive set of skill players. Likewise, Newsome knew Harbaugh had a desire to play more gap scheme in the run game and building around an athletic QB would help the coach do it. That\u2019s why Harbaugh hired Roman, who also happened to be perfect for Jackson.\n\nBut that Mahomes and Jackson have benefited from all that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a lot to learn from what the NFL struck out with on them\u2014or that those guys wouldn\u2019t have succeeded absent the really good circumstances they arrived in the NFL under.\n\n\u201cI think the biggest thing to me is there are no perfect quarterbacks,\u201d said one AFC GM. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be dealing with some weaknesses, and some things they do really well. But really, none of them are exceptional in every category. Other than maybe Andrew Luck in 2012, no one checks every box. And the bottom line is you\u2019ll go broke looking for the perfect prospect.\u201d\n\nObviously, that was part of it for the Chiefs and Ravens. The Chiefs felt like they could clean up Mahomes\u2019s fundamentals, and that he could learn Reid\u2019s system\u2014so neither deficiency would be nearly enough to give them pause. And the Ravens did enough work on Jackson to feel confident that his playmaking ability was worth gambling on, and that Jackson himself had the tools to improve as a passer and the head to adjust to the pro game.\n\nYears later, those bets have paid off handsomely.\n\nBut there was also an open-mindedness applied here, on where the game is going. These guys weren\u2019t playing in traditional pro offenses in college, and so rather than trying to shoehorn them into those sorts of schemes, their teams met them halfway. Reid applied some Air Raid concepts. Harbaugh and his staff weren\u2019t shy about implementing option looks. And that made it so Mahomes and Jackson could hit the ground running.\n\nThe fact is, not everyone is willing to do these things\u2014and not all players are worth overturning the apple cart for. Mahomes and Jackson clearly were.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re really asking yourself simple questions,\u201d said another AFC exec. \u201cDo we think this is a great player? Yes. Can we build our offense to fit him? Yes. It\u2019s no different than how you look at other positions. If we took Aaron Donald in 2014, we can\u2019t play our defense the way we do and expect him to be as productive. We have to set it up for him. That\u2019s why so many teams passed on Donald. Honestly, it\u2019s the exact same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot every coach is willing to do what Harbaugh and Roman were willing to do,\u201d said a second AFC GM. \u201cThat\u2019s part of it. And I think more coaches are getting there, and being more open-minded to looking at college concepts that do work for these guys. Instead of saying, I run the West Coast offense, and this guy must fit the system, I think now you gotta adapt to what you have.\u201d\n\nTruth is, this isn\u2019t all that new, either. Back in 2012, Washington did it with Robert Griffin III, importing the Baylor offense to great results, with the idea being that playing that way would buy the then-raw Griffin time to develop what he didn\u2019t have, so by the time teams caught up with what they were doing, the quarterback and offense would\u2019ve grown an array of counterpunches.\n\nA bad injury and internal politics too complex to discuss in full here wound up firebombing that plan in late 2012 and through 2013. But Baltimore and Kansas City have proved in the time since that it very much can work.\n\n\u201cKyle and Mike Shanahan had figured it out the whole time,\u201d joked the first AFC exec.\n\nThe problem was, postinjury, it took Griffin a little too long.\n\n***\n\nAnd then there\u2019s that last element\u2014focusing on who the player is as a person.\n\nLast year, ex-Louisville coach Bobby Petrino told me this story about Jackson\u2019s first college practice. Petrino was standing with his AD, Tom Jurich, as Jackson ran the scout team, and on one play, the quarterback took the snap out of the shotgun, stood flat-footed and threw over the defense for a touchdown. Petrino leaned over to Jurich and said, We got a real one.\n\n\u201cThe way he snapped his wrist and threw that post for a touchdown, it was something. If you work with him, you see,\u201d Petrino said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the one thing I really respect about the Ravens. They were the only group that came in and spent time with me and my staff to find this stuff out. They spent two hours with me\u2014the quarterbacks coach and head of scouting were there. ... I was surprised more people didn\u2019t want to talk to me about Lamar.\u201d\n\nThe Ravens figured out who Jackson was, while others were put off by the fact that he didn\u2019t immediately command every room he walked into. Just the same, the Chiefs dug into Mahomes and saw what others did, but maybe didn\u2019t prioritize enough.\n\nAnd who Jackson and Mahomes are wound up being vitally important to where they were going\u2014because that dictated their willingness to fix the imperfections in their games, which would determine how sustainable they\u2019d be in the NFL.\n\n\u201cThere have been plenty of guys that were dynamic players that haven\u2019t panned out,\u201d said our second AFC exec. \u201cOne thing that stands out about those two was their competitiveness, how they are as teammates. Both were smart football players on the field, can throw from different platforms and arm angles. But their competitiveness and desire to win is what pushes them. \u2026 They were confident, but it\u2019s not like they were these outward Alphas. They weren\u2019t trying too hard. They were just good dudes and they loved ball.\u201d\n\nAnd, the exec continued, that would manifest in the pros in guys who were \u201calways gonna be driven to improve. You tell him to improve, and he\u2019s gonna do it. Both those guys. Joe Burrow\u2019s the same way. Highly competitive, highly driven and highly coachable.\u201d\n\nSo, really, you can distill all this to just a few things. One, these guys were great players all along. Two, they were genuinely competitive and driven, which would be a good place to start as they worked to improve what wasn\u2019t there. Three, they went to teams that didn\u2019t want them to be anything but the best versions of themselves.\n\nTwo and a half years ago, Harbaugh and his coaches saw all of that, and figured that they could take care of the rest.\n\nI\u2019d say they were right.\n\n***\n\nJohn W. McDonough/Sports Illustrated\n\nPOWER RANKINGS\n\nI think I need to give you a 1\u20132 matchup this week. The good news is I have to change nothing from last week to do it.\n\n1) Kansas City Chiefs (2\u20130): I think the Chargers are a really good team. And that game Sunday still gave you the feeling that Kansas City can flip a switch when it needs to, to get itself out of trouble. Which is a nice thing to have.\n\n2) Baltimore Ravens (2\u20130): Based on how the Ravens have played through two weeks, I\u2019d have no qualms with anyone putting them first. The margin here was razor thin.\n\n3) Seattle Seahawks (2\u20130): The defense needs work, but Russell Wilson is playing like a man on a mission\u2014to prove to everyone he\u2019s the best player in football. And the offense in general looked balanced and explosive against New England.\n\n4) Green Bay Packers (2\u20130): I was tempted to put them third. They\u2019ve broken 40 points off two weeks in a row, and the defense came on strong against Detroit. They\u2019ve drafted really well under GM Brian Gutekunst, and it\u2019s showing.\n\n5) Buffalo Bills (2\u20130): It was tough to pick a fifth team this week, but give Buffalo credit for taking care of business in their division. If the strides we\u2019ve seen from Josh Allen prove to be real, and the defense picks up the pace a little, this could be a 12-win type of team.\n\n***\n\nBrian Fluharty-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTHE BIG QUESTION\n\nShould the Patriots extend Cam Newton?\n\nI\u2019ve gotten this question a lot the last week. My answer might surprise you\u2014it\u2019s a very resounding yes. And by yes, I don\u2019t mean, yes, in a couple of months. I mean, yes, right now. I\u2019ll try to show you why this isn\u2019t an overreaction by giving you three reasons that I think would be tough to argue with.\n\nIf Newton keeps playing well, you\u2019ll lose leverage. After being dumped by Carolina, it stands to reason that Newton wouldn\u2019t mind knowing where he\u2019s spending the next few years. And by paying him now, you\u2019d be mitigating 14 games of injury risk for him, which would give him reason to give you a discount. If you wait until midseason, and this continues, the dynamic for a player like him inevitably moves from I should take the injury protection now to I only have to make it through X number of games to get to free agency.\n\nIt\u2019ll help you manage your cap with cap uncertainty looming. In doing a deal now, you\u2019re folding in his discounted 2020 financials with future money. So let\u2019s say you give him a Ryan Tannehill extension\u2014four years, $118 million. That\u2019s $29.5 million per year. But if you add the $5 million or so he\u2019ll get this year, you\u2019re now at $123 million over five. That\u2019s less than $25 million per year, and you can play with the numbers to make it work however you want cap-wise.\n\nAs such, you can dump cap dollars into this year. With a cap dip likely coming in 2021, this is important. At one point, the Patriots had the least cap space in the NFL. Now, they have the fifth-most, at $24.52 million. So they could take a fairly sizable hit now, to manage what\u2019s coming down the line. And yes, you can roll cap space over. But relying on that to absorb a massive free-agent deal with Newton would be infinitely more complicated than getting some certainty on the situation now.\n\nIt would likely give you more flexibility down the line. Everyone knows NFL contracts are worth only what\u2019s guaranteed, and just about every one of them isn\u2019t worth much before three years. Assuming it\u2019d take a three-year commitment on a longer deal to get Cam signed, why not start that clock now? Doing the deal today would likely mean marrying yourself to Newton through 2022, which is just two more years from where you are now. And that means you\u2019d maintain a fair amount of flexibility in the bargain.\n\nBest case for the Patriots, Newton can be their franchise QB going forward. But even if he\u2019s not, can\u2019t he be what Alex Smith was for Kansas City and buy the Patriots time to find a twentysomething they\u2019re absolutely smitten with? And if that\u2019s the low-end of the equation here, barring significant injury, wouldn\u2019t they be O.K. with that?\n\nI know I would be. I also know it\u2019s a lot better than stumbling around in the quarterback wilderness looking for the next one.\n\n***\n\nUSA Today Sports\n\nWHAT NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT\n\nHow the Raiders might\u2019ve gotten the best of the Khalil Mack deal.\n\nDo I know that definitively yet? No, I do not. Is it on the table? It sure is. Here\u2019s what the Raiders\u2019 return in the 2018 megadeal was harvested.\n\n\u2022 2019 first-round pick: Alabama RB Josh Jacobs.\n\n\u2022 2019 sixth-round pick: Used as capital to land LSU TE Foster Moreau.\n\n\u2022 2020 first-round pick: Ohio State CB Damon Arnette.\n\n\u2022 2020 third-round pick: South Carolina WR Bryan Edwards.\n\nJacobs, Arnette and Edwards all started and played the great majority of snaps on their sides of the ball as Vegas stunned the Saints on Monday night, and Moreau wound up playing more than Jason Witten did as the Raiders\u2019 second tight end\u2014even making a crucial 31-yard catch on the team\u2019s go-ahead drive in the third quarter.\n\nThose four guys\u2019 combined cap number for 2020 ($6.8 million) is nearly $20 million less than Mack\u2019s cap charge in Chicago ($26.6 million). Those four Raiders are 21 (Edwards), 22 (Jacobs), 23 (Moreau) and 24 (Arnette) years old. Mack turns 30 in February.\n\nNow, the Bears did get picks back in the deal (those became TE Cole Kmet and OL Arlington Hambright), and there\u2019s no arguing what Mack\u2019s meant over two years there as Matt Nagy has established his program.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think the Bears would do anything differently. But along those lines, I know the Raiders don\u2019t have regrets either. And yes, part of this was about the amount of cash they were willing to shell out at the time (two years before the windfall of the move to Vegas). But they also had to ask themselves this question: How quickly can we contend, what will Mack have left then and will we still want to be paying the freight when we get there?\n\nThe answer then was that it would take a while for the Raiders to build, and Mack might not be worth the price tag once they got there. And that answer stands up today, I\u2019d say.\n\nAnd that\u2019s nothing against Mack whatsoever. It\u2019s just the reality of the situation.\n\n***\n\nTHE FINAL WORD\n\nWe\u2019re in the midst of a rough patch in the Thursday Night Football schedule, but I\u2019m strangely excited to get a full look at Gardner Minshew tonight.

Unlike her royal counterpart, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has largely kept her son, Archie Harrison, out of the spotlight and wants him to live as normal a life as possible. Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, on the other hand, has largely raised her three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, in the public eye. While Meghan has received a lot of criticism over her parenting style, royal experts have officially weighed in on which approach is best.\n\nKate Middleton and Meghan Markle | Stephen Pond/Getty Images\n\nMeghan protects Archie at all costs\n\nNo matter how much they stay out of public view, it is almost impossible for members of the royal family to have private lives. But that did not stop Meghan and Prince Harry from trying to protect Archie from prying eyes.\n\nEver since his birth in the spring of 2019, Meghan has kept Archie out of the royal spotlight. Not only did she forgo the traditional photo op at the hospital following his birth, but she also kept his christening a private event.\n\nNow that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are no longer members of the royal family, royal experts believe that Meghan\u2019s parenting style will be even more noticeable, especially when it comes to keeping Archie out of the public spotlight.\n\n\u201cNow that Harry and Meghan have chosen to shun Royal life, this differing [parenting] style becomes clear,\u201d royal expert Martina Mercer shared. \u201cMeghan and Harry have forgone royal expectations while creating a bubble around their little family, putting the welfare of Archie center stage.\u201d\n\nBecause of her need to protect Archie, Meghan failed to follow royal traditions and did not give the media any access to Archie. Instead, she has only released photos of her son on Instagram, and all of the images are thoroughly vetted before they are posted.\n\nKate Middleton takes a different approach\n\nWhile Meghan has kept tight control over Archie, Kate has gone in a completely different direction. With her oldest son set to sit on the throne someday, the Duchess of Cambridge has not been shy about embracing royal traditions.\n\n\u201cKate, meanwhile, has understood her responsibilities from the outset, while choosing to follow royal tradition,\u201d Mercer explained. \u201cShe has ticked every box, from the photoshoot after the birth to the annual photos of the children, while making the most of royal privileges, such as the army of staff that are on hand to help in raising the children.\u201d\n\nAlthough Kate Middleton has taken a different approach to parenting, Mercer emphasized that neither method is inherently wrong. The only negative consequence of Meghan\u2019s approach is that she has been criticized more in the press.\n\nWhile the negative press will likely continue, Meghan Markle doesn\u2019t have to worry about it as much now that she is no longer a part of the royal family. She and Harry stepped down at the beginning of January and are expected to make their exit official this spring.\n\nLiving in North America will definitely isolate Meghan and Harry from British tabloids, which is honestly a good thing for the young family.\n\nWhy are Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle\u2019s parenting styles so different?\n\nAccording to Express, the royal line of succession is one reason why Kate and Meghan\u2019s parenting styles are so different. Kate has always known that George will be the King of the United Kingdom someday, so keeping him out of the spotlight would do him more harm than good.\n\nKate Middleton and her husband, Prince William, love all three of their children, but they also understand the importance of preparing them for public life. While it is sad, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge know that keeping their kids isolated from the media is not the right way to go.\n\n\u201cKate and William obviously adore their children yet they also understand the huge responsibility that comes with being a Royal Family and Kate\u2019s style of parenting ensures their children embrace the royal way of life from the outset while ensuring the children carry on tradition and grow to be respected royals in the public eye,\u201d Mercer stated.\n\nMeghan and Harry, however, do not have the same expectations. Harry is currently sixth in line to the throne and will likely never inherit the crown. In fact, the couple did not even bother to give Archie a royal title when he was born, which shows how much they wanted to keep him out of the spotlight.\n\nExperts weigh in on parenting in the royal family\n\nIn light of the differences between Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, a few parenting experts weighed in on the matter and offered their thoughts on which style is better.\n\nAt the end of the day, the experts agreed that having a child who is destined to be in the spotlight is not easy. With that in mind, they did not blame Meghan for wanting to protect Archie, but at the same time, they praised Kate for handling the situation like a pro.\n\n\u201cHaving to parent in the public eye would be every mum\u2019s nightmare, however, the Duchess of Cambridge does it was such grace and serenity I have to say I\u2019m a little jealous,\u201d expert Angela Spencer shared. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely to see her acting so naturally with her children and that they are obviously allowed to let their individuality be part of their public life too.\u201d\n\nKate Middleton and Meghan Markle, of course, have not commented on the reports surrounding their differing parenting styles, both of which clearly have their merits.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2021/01/jj-watt-deshaun-watson-sorry-video-nfl-films-texans", "authors": ["Andrew Joseph", "Charles Mcdonald", "Charles Curtis", "January"], "title": "J.J.

If the third-overall pick in the 2018 draft isn\u2019t going to make the kind of leap a third-overall pick needs to make, then does it become fair to wonder if it\u2019s ever going to happen?\n\nHere\u2019s the rub, though: Without players around any quarterback \u2014 specifically a sound offensive line to protect him \u2014 how can anyone expect him to flourish?\n\nFor his first two seasons, Darnold has not had enough protection in front of him or offensive weapons around him to succeed.\n\nThat, the Jets and every single one of their success-starved fans hope, should be different this season \u2014 largely because of their aggressive makeover of the offensive line, with four new starters expected by the start of the season.\n\nIn a frenetic six-day span at the start of free agency in March, general manager Joe Douglas ripped apart the offensive line at its foundation and started over.\n\nDouglas\u2019 first order of business was signing 6-foot-6, 325-pound tackle George Fant on March 16. A day later, former Broncos center Connor McGovern was signed and so, too, was former Panthers guard Greg Van Roten. Then they re-signed guard Alex Lewis, who figures to be the only returning starter.\n\nThe final piece to the grand rebuild came with the 11th-overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, when Louisville tackle Mekhi Becton was selected.\n\nSo, the shopping has been done. Now comes the hard part: Getting all of these new pieces to fit together well enough so that Darnold is properly protected and running back Le\u2019Veon Bell never averages 3.2 yards per carry again as he did last season.\n\nComplicating that challenge of piecing together that puzzle for Jets coach Adam Gase and his offensive line assistant Frank Pollack is navigating through the COVID-19 restrictions that prevent the players from being around each other in offseason programs until further notice.\n\nSubmit questions on your favorite New York teams to be answered in an upcoming mailbag\n\nSure, every team in the league faces the same restrictions and challenges, but not every team in the NFL is planning on four new starters on its offensive line.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult and delicate enough for a new offensive line to jell under normal circumstances that include an offseason program, minicamp and OTAs. Consider that these four new Jets starters have not yet met each other and won\u2019t until who knows when.\n\n\u201cEverybody is dealing with this situation together,\u2019\u2019 Fant said on a Zoom call with reporters Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to make it work and keep working. It\u2019s very challenging. Offensive line play is all about being together and being on one page, and we\u2019ve got kind of a whole new room. We\u2019re doing everything virtually right now. We\u2019re talking, getting to know each other.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not really going to set in until we all get together and figure out each other\u2019s personalities, get on the field together, get on the grass and figure out how each other plays.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhenever that does happen, the first order of business for Pollack is deciding which sides Becton and Fant will play.\n\nBecton started 21 of his final 23 games at Louisville at left tackle, though he did play on the right side his freshman year. Fant has made it clear be believes he\u2019s best suited to play left tackle, though he, too, has played both sides.\n\nA common denominator to the Jets\u2019 two new bookend tackles lies in their respective raw talent.\n\nBecton is just 21 years old with three years of college under his sizeable belt.\n\nThough he\u2019s been in the NFL for three seasons, Fant is new to the game, having played just one year of college football as a tight end at Western Kentucky after completing his college basketball career there. When Fant got to Seattle he was converted to tackle, but has started just 24 of his 46 games in the league, including seven in each of the past two seasons.\n\nSo, both are developmental players, though with significant upsides.\n\n\u201cI think the good things about both of us is we\u2019re really raw and really athletic,\u2019\u2019 Fant said.\n\nFant went as far as to say he believes he\u2019s \u201ccapable\u2019\u2019 of reaching an \u201cAll-Pro level,\u2019\u2019 adding, \u201cI\u2019ve just got to go out and prove it now. I feel like this is just the beginning for me.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Jets need the new beginnings for Fant, Becton and their entire new offensive line to help lead to the beginning of stardom for Darnold.

Demonstrations were peaceful during that event, according to reports.\n\n\u201cIf we are found to be guilty of the charges, then 1.7 million people should be guilty of participation in an unauthorized assembly,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut that\u2019s absurd. Are you going to prosecute 1.7 million people?\u201d\n\nMartin Lee, an 81-year-old activist and former lawmaker, and democracy advocates Albert Ho and Au Nok-hin, were among those arrested Saturday.

He told me that over this past summer he went back over old images taken of Saturn with the Subaru 8.2-meter telescope. These were deep images planned to look for faint moons, and many were discovered right away at the time. Sheppard suspected more, very faint moons were in there, so he dug around the images and looked (by eye!) for objects that moved.\n\nEven then they couldn\u2019t be announced. The motions betrayed their status as Saturnian moons, but later observations were needed for confirmation. He had to calculate their orbits and predict where they\u2019d be in later years \u2014 not a trivial task, since they move around Saturn and Saturn moves around the Sun. Nevertheless, he was able to do so, and the 20 new moons were then confirmed by the International Astronomical Union (or IAU), the official designator of cosmic things.\n\nThe moons of Saturn form groups according to their inclination (orbital tilt). The Norse group orbit retrograde at high angle (top), while the Gallic and Inuit groups orbit prograde at lower inclination. The newly discovered moons are shown as teal circles. Credit: Scott Sheppard\n\nThe moons are interesting. Out of the 20, 17 orbit Saturn backwards, or retrograde, which means in the opposite sense of Saturn\u2019s rotation. They also all have about the same inclination angle, meaning their orbits are all tilted to Saturn\u2019s equator by roughly the same amount (between 140\u00b0 and 180\u00b0, where 0\u00b0 would be prograde \u2014 orbiting in the same sense as Saturn \u2014 directly above its equator, and 90\u00b0 would be a perfectly polar orbit). This is a strong indicator they all had the same origin, probably two moons colliding or one moon getting hit by a comet or asteroid long ago. Such a catastrophic collision would shatter the moons, creating lots of smaller ones, all orbiting with roughly the same inclination.\n\nAstronomers call collections of objects like this groups. This one is called the Norse group (and the moons in it have Norse names). The most distant moon of Saturn is one of these new ones, and falls in this group. Another in this group is Phoebe, which is over 200 km across, and is likely what\u2019s left of the moon that got whacked (and, if it\u2019s name sounds familiar, is the source of the protomolecule in The Expanse), and is also likely to be a captured object from the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy objects orbiting the Sun out past Neptune (and of which Pluto is the largest member).\n\nAnimation showing the motion of the newly discovered Saturn moon S/2004 S24. Credit: Scott Sheppard\n\nOf the three remaining moons, which orbit prograde, two are in the Inuit group (with inclinations of 45\u00b0 to 50\u00b0) and the other in the Gallic group (about 36\u00b0). That last one, at the moment called S/2004 S24, is very interesting indeed. While it clearly is in the Gallic group due to its tilt, it\u2019s much farther out from Saturn than the rest of the group. It\u2019s not clear why. Perhaps some odd gravitational interaction pulled it away from the planet, or perhaps the others moved closer in after forming while this one didn\u2019t.\n\nAll of these moons tell us more about Saturn, or at least hint at its environment and conditions in the past. The more moons found, the more complete a picture that is. I\u2019ll note, too, that this makes Sheppard and his team the most successful moon hunters in history (they found that recent dozen-moon passel around Jupiter, too). Quite an achievement.\n\nVideo of New Moon Alert: Saturn has 20 new Moons!\n\nHow many moons may orbit Saturn? Well, it depends on what you mean by \u201cmoon\u201d; at the lower size end there\u2019s no real definition. But even if you draw the line at, say, 1 km, this means there are a lot more out there. These moons, at 5 km across, are pushing hard at the limit of what we can do from Earth right now; ones smaller would be too faint to see (after all, they\u2019re over 1.3 billion kilometers away from us at best!). But in general, collisions make a few big objects, a few more middling ones, and lots of smaller ones. If these are 5 km wide, I\u2019d wager there are hundreds at 1 km. It\u2019ll be a while before those are found, though.\n\nSo I wouldn\u2019t get too hung up on Saturn holding the record now, or Jupiter having it until recently. There could be many hundreds, even thousands more out there is you include Uranus and Neptune.\n\nOh, one more thing. These 20 new moons\u2026 how\u2019d you like to name them?\n\nBecause you can! Sheppard and his team are holding a contest to suggest names for this new score of satellites. You can read all about it online. There are some rules, though. The biggest is that the names have to be appropriate for their specific group, so Inuit, Gallic, and Norse. Moreover, given Saturn\u2019s moons being named after Titans, the new moons all have to be named after giants in those mythologies. There are rules from the IAU, too, so be sure to read those (even further, you can\u2019t repeat any names of asteroids or other objects, so check those as well).\n\nGot a name? Then you can suggest it to Sheppard\u2019s group on Twitter, @SaturnLunacy (include the hashtag #NameSaturnsMoons).\n\nQuite a few suggestions have already been made, and the contest ends on 6 December, 2019, so think fast!", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.nba.com/spurs/spurs-sign-trey-lyles", "authors": ["Posted", "Jul"], "title": "SPURS SIGN TREY LYLES", "text": "SAN ANTONIO (July 12, 2019) \u2013 The San Antonio Spurs today announced that they have signed forward Trey Lyles.

Photo: Kelsey McNeal/ABC\n\nFor a Bachelor season that was seemingly able to break the Richter scale for petty, inconsequential drama with every episode, the \u201cWomen Tell All\u201d special was a surprisingly snoozy experience that no amount of $4 white wine could cure. Remember when Mykenna and Tammy fought about \u2026 something? And Alayah and Victoria P. argued about \u2026 that other thing? Ha ha. Yeah, we don\u2019t either. Get our boy Dr. Shaun Murphy in here for a diagnosis. There were, though, a few lingering threads we needed answers to, which obviously meant dissecting everything related to Victoria F. Ever the devoted Bachelor servants, here are the bombshells you need to know.\n\nVictoria F. was sent home at the rose ceremony\u2026\n\nSurprise! Before the actual \u201cWomen Tell All\u201d shenanigans were afoot, the show had to do some narrative housekeeping: Peter sent home Victoria F. at the rose ceremony in Australia, even though it looked like Madison wouldn\u2019t be showing up thanks to his very randy behavior during Fantasy Suites. In her requisite car interview, Victoria somewhat put the blame on Madison\u2019s values about sex, equating her behavior to an ultimatum. \u201cI think the conversation he had with Madison changed everything that he felt with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact that someone could sway his opinion with an ultimatum, I mean, it sucks. I just don\u2019t want him to regret any decisions he\u2019s made.\u201d\n\n\u2026and she also denied all of those home-wrecking accusations.\n\nVictoria has been plagued by external morsels of drama all season long, whether it was with her modeling past for Confederate-inspired clothing or allegedly breaking up several marriages in her hometown of Virginia Beach. (And not only that, but breaking up several marriages of her friends.) When she was point-blank asked about these claims by Chris Harrison, she vehemently denied them. \u201cAbsolutely not. And I think it\u2019s just hard to have this guy who I\u2019m dating, who could potentially be my husband, now think that about me,\u201d she responded. \u201cAnd once that\u2019s out there, people think that about you. I definitely could have handled it better, obviously could have handled the whole season better, but I can\u2019t go back in time.\u201d Victoria also said that the woman who confronted Peter about her alleged behavior \u2014 his ex-girlfriend, Merissa \u2014 did it because she \u201cmaybe wanted to come on the show\u201d for attention. As a helpful reminder, Merissa\u2019s face was fully blurred.\n\nPeter still doesn\u2019t know how his season will end.\n\nWell, add this nonsense to the growing list of theories: Pilot Pete himself doesn\u2019t know what will happen in the two-part finale next week. \u201cIt\u2019s a finale so unexpected, so unprecedented,\u201d Harrison teased before one of the commercial breaks, \u201cthere is not a single person who knows how Peter\u2019s journey will end. Not even Peter.\u201d Weber also expressed annoyance that people are writing critical articles about his poor decision making skills.\n\nWe received a PSA about online harassment.\n\nIn a surprisingly earnest segment, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay, who previously said that the franchise failed to protect her, read aloud various racist, hateful, and cruel social media messages sent to the current group of Bachelor contestants. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfortunate because people have become so comfortable being mean, and meaner than ever, on social media. If we\u2019re ever going to fix this problem, we have to acknowledge the problem,\u201d Lindsay explained. \u201cWhen I was asked to be the Bachelorette, I knew it would be hard. I knew I would get even more hate and criticism. But I wanted to pave a way for women who look like me who hadn\u2019t been represented in this role on this show. But sometimes I feel like my efforts are in vain because it seems to be getting so much worse. I feel like you guys see us talk about the hate we receive, but you have no idea what it actually is.\u201d\n\nSome of the messages read aloud were death threats, while others mocked the races of certain contestants. \u201cI\u2019m shaking as I\u2019m reading this because it\u2019s shocking, it\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d Lindsay continued through tears. \u201cI know how uncomfortable it is for you to see. Just imagine how uncomfortable it is to get this in your comments and your DMs every day, every week, every month. And that\u2019s just a tip of the iceberg.\u201d Every woman raised their hands when Harrison asked them if they experienced recent digital harassment.\n\nKelley and Natasha were no-shows. Boooooo!\n\nMaking for very odd optics, two of the season\u2019s top six contestants didn\u2019t show up to the \u201cWomen Tell All\u201d taping: Kelley and Natasha, who were obvious fan favorites thanks to their unabashedly open and no-bullshit personalities.

Something already tipped the planet on its side, so its orbit is perpendicular to those of the other Solar System planets. It probably smells terrible. And now scientists have discovered that the atmosphere of Uranus is leaking out into space.\n\nHidden in the data from Voyager 2's historic 1986 encounter with the icy planet, and undiscovered until now, was the presence of a plasmoid - a pocket of atmospheric material being funnelled away from Uranus by the planet's magnetic field.\n\nIt's the first time a plasmoid has been spotted in connection with an ice giant, and it doesn't just show us that Uranus' atmosphere is leaking. It's also revealing some of the dynamics of this planet's peculiar, twisted magnetic field.\n\nActually, leaky atmospheres aren't that uncommon. It's called atmospheric escape, and it's how Mars, for example, turned from what we think was quite a damp planet into a dusty barren wasteland. Venus is leaking hydrogen. Jupiter's moon Io and Saturn's moon Titan are leaking. Even Earth is losing about 90 tonnes of atmospheric material a day (don't worry, we have around 5,140 trillion tonnes, it will take a long time to completely disappear).\n\n(David Stern, Reviews of Geophysics, 1996)\n\nThere are several mechanisms whereby this can occur, and one of those is through plasmoids. These are large, cylindrical bubbles of plasma - ionised gas - bound by magnetic field lines streaming away from the Sun, the region known as the magnetotail. The image above shows what that looks like for Earth.\n\nIons from the atmosphere are channelled along the magnetic field into this region. When the solar wind causes the magnetic field to break at the side facing the Sun - the bow shock - they whip around and reconnect in the tail, pinching off spinning plasmoids. Some of the ions bounce back towards the planet (producing, on Earth, auroras), and the plasmoid hurtles off in the opposite direction, taking the atmospheric ions with it.\n\nFor Earth, that's pretty straightforward and well understood. And there's evidence solar wind tears plasmoids off Mars on a daily basis in a slightly different fashion, since Mars doesn't have a global magnetic field.\n\nBut Uranus is a tricky beast of a planet, and let's be honest, its magnetic field is a straight-up mess.\n\nWhere Earth's magnetic field is more or less consistent with the planet's orientation, Uranus' is all twisted sideways, with the magnetic poles angled 59 degrees away from the geographic poles. And it's not even centred. If you were to draw a line between those two poles, it would miss the centre of Uranus by quite a large distance.\n\nThere's even evidence to suggest that the magnetic field opens at night and closes during the day. Seriously, look at this. Who came up with this.\n\n(Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain)\n\nIt was this mess of a magnetic field that drew the attention of astronomers Gina DiBraccio and Dan Gershman of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, who were planning potential planetary missions and thought this particular oddity would be a good starting point.\n\nThey were studying the data collected by Voyager 2's magnetometer in January 1986 in higher resolution than any previous research when they noticed a wiggle in the data, a blip in the magnetic field.\n\nThey processed the data and came to the conclusion that, yep. Even though Uranus has a weirdly skewed, wobbly magnetic field, that blip did indeed represent a plasmoid, roughly 204,000 kilometres in length and 400,000 kilometres across (127,000 by 250,000 miles), likely full of ionised hydrogen, moving away from the planet.\n\nAnd this reveals some new information about that magnetic field. According to the researchers' analysis, it shows that Uranus' magnetic field reconnects at the tail, like Earth's.

As of Thursday, there were some 160,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York state and more than 7,000 deaths \u2014 43 percent of the \u00adnational toll. Most of these cases have occurred in Gotham and its suburbs.\n\nOther urban areas, however, have performed much better than we have. The Bay Area, for example, has about the same population as New York City, but only 115 deaths from the coronavirus. San Francisco proper has seen only 10 deaths so far, about 2 percent of the per-capita rate in New York.\n\nNew York and San Francisco are both major urban centers, so why did we do so much worse? Why are their infection rates so different? New York\u2019s density is likely one part of it. As is the fact that the Big Apple receives many more visitors from abroad. But leadership is a big part of the equation, too.\n\nWhile Mayor Bill de Blasio was slow and indecisive, San Francisco\u2019s Mayor London Breed \u00adexemplified proactive leadership when it mattered most \u2014 at the outset.\n\nStart with de Blasio\u2019s failures. Medical researchers have widely recognized that schools turbocharge epidemics: Crowded together, children spread disease, often without falling ill themselves. Yet Hizzoner kept New York\u2019s schools open through early March, even when most other urban districts had closed, students in our schools had fallen ill and teachers and administrators pleaded for closure. Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza arrogantly dismissed a petition with 108,000 signatures demanding the schools be closed.\n\nEven as other cities began taking increasingly drastic measures to slow the outbreak, de Blasio failed to take the crisis seriously. He was furious that the city\u2019s libraries planned to close and threatened to cut their budget in response, \u00adaccording to Politico reporting.\n\nHe refused to cancel the St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade, claiming that the virus required \u201cclose physical proximity\u201d beyond the level of a parade crowd to spread, until the governor intervened. And the day before bars, gyms and restaurants closed statewide, Hizzoner took a final trip to his own gym and urged New Yorkers to go out to local restaurants for one last night on the town.\n\nNow compare Frisco. The Golden City\u2019s first case appeared on March 5, about the same time as the first one in New York. But San Francisco\u2019s leaders took the disease seriously from the start.\n\nIn late February, even before any cases had been identified within city limits, Breed \u00addeclared a state of emergency. On March 16, health officials throughout the Bay Area issued a shelter-in-place order, closing all but essential businesses. The state government had already banned large gatherings four days before that.\n\nThat proactiveness bought time. \u201cWe were maybe a week up on New York,\u201d one UC Berkeley public-health expert told the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like much time, but in terms of the spread of this pandemic, it\u2019s enormous.\u201d \u00adIndeed.\n\nAnd San Francisco has a much lower infection rate than its low-density suburbs such as Santa Clara County \u2014 not to mention other sprawling metropolitan areas such as Detroit and New Orleans.\n\nProactive leadership has yielded dividends elsewhere, too. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, for example, took statewide measures against the spread of coronavirus much sooner than neighboring Tennessee did, including advising a statewide closure of schools more than a week earlier.\n\nThe result: Though the first cases in both states appeared at about the same time, Kentucky, with only two-thirds the population of Tennessee, has one-fifth of the coronavirus cases. In northern Italy as well, towns that \u00adimposed early quarantine measures and shutdowns escaped the worst of the contagion.\n\nWhen it comes to leadership in a crisis \u2014 especially one of public health \u2014 proactiveness pays off. De Blasio may have worried about being called alarmist if he had imposed a shutdown in early March.\n\nWhatever the cause, that week of delay has now exposed New York to far worse. Meanwhile, Breed acted early and decisively, even when the public still didn\u2019t see the virus as a serious threat, and San Francisco is better off for it. Fortune, as the Latin proverb goes, favors the bold. Doubly so in a crisis.\n\nConnor Harris is a policy analyst at the Manhattan Institute.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.salon.com/2020/06/17/far-right-boogaloo-boy-killed-officer-after-using-black-lives-matter-protest-as-cover-prosecutors/", "authors": [], "title": "Far-right \u201cBoogaloo boy\u201d killed officer after using Black Lives Matter protest as cover: prosecutors", "text": "A California man charged with killing a federal officer and a sheriff's deputy has ties to the far-right \"Boogaloo\" movement, according to federal authorities.\n\nAir Force Staff Sgt.

And it\u2019s still so early in development that Goldfarb declines to go into much detail about how all of it will work.\n\n\n\nIn addition to songs written by artists like Soilwork\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn Strid and Arch Enemy\u2019s Alissa White-Gluz, the plan is also to have the game\u2019s story narrated by Troy Baker while Mass Effect\u2019s Jennifer Hale voices one of the main characters . The game is currently targeting 2021 for a cross-gen release on Xbox One, PS4, Xbox Series X, PS5, and PC, but it\u2019s also clear that it\u2019s still early in development. The Outsiders announced earlier this year that it was halting development on an earlier project called Darkborn. \u201cBut one door closes and another opens,\u201d the studio wrote at the time.

It appears that Dulos had borrowed the truck, according to the warrant.\n\nThe employee, who was cleared as a suspect, allegedly told cops Dulos urged him to replace the truck\u2019s seats and was \u201cpushy\u201d about it, sometimes growing angry.\n\nEventually the seats were removed, but the employee kept them \u201cin the event they may be needed by police,\u201d according to the warrant.\n\nThe worker told cops that Dulos had the interior of the pickup detailed and the exterior washed, the warrant said.\n\nDulos allegedly told the employee he was worried cops would find \u201ca hair\u201d belonging to Jennifer inside the truck because he\u2019d apparently hugged her on Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear at what point the body allegedly might have been put in the pickup, but when cops asked Troconis why Fotis had it cleaned five days after Jennifer vanished, she allegedly replied, \u201cWell obviously . . . it\u2019s because the body of Jennifer at some point was in there,\u201d the warrant said.\n\nDulos and Troconis, 44, were charged in June with tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution.

As Washington (and the entire NFL, really) eagerly waits for the Redskins to hand the keys to the offense over to first-round pick Dwayne Haskins, the team has added another quarterback to the mix as its current starter deals with an injury that prevented him from taking part in practice on Wednesday. Before anyone gets their hopes up, it does not sound like Haskins is on the verge of playing. But for the first time this season, a tiny window has opened up.\n\nOn Wednesday, Redskins starting quarterback Case Keenum missed practice with a foot injury. Also on Wednesday, one of the team's backup quarterbacks, Colt McCoy, made his return from a broken leg he suffered last season. He was listed as practicing in full, though the team only held a walkthrough rather than a full session. But according to Redskins coach Jay Gruden, if Keenum is unable to play on Sunday, it wouldn't be McCoy who would take over as the team's new starter -- it would be Haskins. However, Gruden also said that he expects Keenum to play on Sunday, which makes Haskins unlikely to start (told you not to get your hopes up).\n\nRedskins didn't allow Dwayne Haskins talk to media today after it was revealed there's a slight chance he could play Sunday because of Case Keenum injury.\n\nKeenum, traded from Denver to Washington in the offseason, has started the first three games of the season. Until Week 3, he actually fared better than expected with a 69.1 completion percentage, 601 yards, five touchdowns, and no interceptions. But it predictably all came crashing back down to earth against the Bears on Monday night when Keenum threw three interceptions and fumbled three times (he lost two), which prompted the Washington crowd to chant (in vain) for Haskins.\n\nAfter the game, Gruden said he wouldn't be benching Keenum ahead of the team's matchup with Daniel Jones and the Giants on Sunday.\n\nWill Washington make a change at QB? Doesn't sound like it...  \"I've got to give Case [Keenum] an ample opportunity to play with these new guys.\" - Jay Gruden https://t.co/8azcNxTE3n https://t.co/Pt8yWXY2Ls\n\nMcCoy's return could be bad news for those hoping to see Haskins sooner rather than later. If Keenum continues to struggle, the Redskins could bench him, but instead of inserting Haskins into the starting lineup, they could give McCoy a turn first. That might not necessarily be a bad thing for Haskins' long-term development -- the team around the quarterback, regardless of who the quarterback is, is downright terrible -- but the fact remains that the Redskins will continue to be one of the league's least interesting teams until they put the rookie in under center. McCoy won't solve anything.\n\nMaybe it'll happen on Sunday if Keenum's foot proves to be more troublesome than expected and McCoy isn't ready for live game action, but at this point, it seems like the wait for Haskins will continue for a little while longer.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Wed Sep 25 21:47:58 +0000 2019", "id": 1176976664867278849, "id_str": "1176976664867278849", "full_text": "Redskins didn't allow Dwayne Haskins talk to media today after it was revealed there's a slight chance he could play Sunday because of Case Keenum injury.", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 154], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": []}, "source": "<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 69352359, "id_str": "69352359", "name": "Zach Braziller", "screen_name": "NYPost_Brazille", "location": "astoria ", "description": "Sports reporter for the New York Post.

That was the first U.S. interest rate cut since the great financial crisis of 2008, and indeed since the creation of bitcoin in 2009.\n\nBTC rose by over $200 to $10,000 in the three hours leading up to the Fed\u2019s announcement at 18:00 UTC. More importantly, the cryptocurrency remained bid in the following hours and hit a high of $10,172, according to Bitstamp data.\n\nThe price action seems to have convinced investors that BTC picked up a bid due to Fed\u2019s rate cut.\n\nBoon for bitcoin?\n\nSome observers believe rate cuts by the Fed bode well for BTC.\n\nThis is because an interest rate cut reduces the yield on a currency. Further, the liquidity added to the economy via rate cuts often leads to inflation and loss of purchasing power of the currency.\n\nPut simply, falling interest rates mean fewer reasons to hold U.S. dollars, as pointed out by Alan Silbert, executive managing director at INX Trading Platform.\n\nSilbert believes the Fed will deliver more rate cuts in the near future. The central bank, however, refrained from signaled further easing yesterday.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates less than 12 months away from bitcoin\u2019s mining reward halving \u2013 a process aimed at curbing inflation by reducing reward for mining on the blockchain by 50 percent every four years.\n\nEssentially, BTC\u2019s monetary policy is on a preset path \u2013 its supply is halved every four years.\n\nThe monetary policy divergence would widen further if the Fed embarks on a full-blown easing cycle, as anticipated by Silbert. That would further strengthen bitcoin\u2019s appeal as store of value and may bolster the bull market.\n\nAs for the next 24 hours, bitcoin looks set to test key average located at $10,500.\n\n4-hour chart\n\nBTC rose above $10,000 yesterday, validating the seller exhaustion signaled by the long-tailed doji created on the 4-hour chart on July 28.\n\nThat bullish doji reversal indicates that the sell-off from recent highs above $13,000 has ended and the path of least resistance is to the higher side. The descending triangle breakout confirmed yesterday also indicates a bull reversal.\n\nNotably, buying volumes picked up following the price breakout. The green volume bar created in the four hours to 16:00 UTC yesterday was the highest since July 19.\n\nHence, the cryptocurrency may rise toward $10,500 (50-day moving average) over the next day or two. However, the outlook as per the daily chart would turn bullish only if and when BTC invalidates the bearish lower-highs pattern with a move above $11,120.\n\nThe case for a rise to the 50-day MA in the next 24 hours would weaken if prices find acceptance below yesterday\u2019s low of $9,574, although that looks unlikely.\n\nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.\n\nBitcoin and dollars image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/sports/nyc-marathon.html", "authors": ["Lindsay Crouse"], "title": "Jepkosgei\u2019s N.Y.C.

Now it\u2019s time for more pardons and commutations,\" Angelos wrote on Instagram about the good news.\n\nAngelos executive produced Snoop Dogg's We From the LBC Soundtrack, which was released in 2002. Later that year, he was targeted in a drug sting by police who believed he was part of a local street gang. After purchasing small amounts of marijuana from the armed producer on multiple occasions, police searched his home and found another weapon. He reportedly turned down a 15-year plea deal and was eventually convicted of 13 charges including drug, firearm, and money laundering charges. He was also hit with three counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. Due to mandatory sentencing, he was given 55 years.\n\nThere was immediate public outcry about the sentencing, even from the judge who was mandated to hand it down, Paul Cassell. Cassell reached out to President Obama in 2016 about commuting the harsh sentence. \u201cThe sentence was unjust, uncruel, and even irrational...because his appeals have been exhausted, the only solution for Angelos is a Presidential commutation. I urge you to swiftly commute his sentence,\u201d he wrote. Obama obliged and commuted Angelos' sentence the same year, and he was released.\n\n\u201cHe had to provide means for his family and himself,\u201d Snoop Dogg said of the case in 2017. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like it was a violent crime he was committing \u2013 he was just hustling.\u201d\n\nSince his release, Angelos has been a advocate for justice reform.

American Record Time", "text": "2019 FINA WORLD AQUATICS CHAMPIONSHIPS\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing that Simone Manuel of the United States has taught us, it\u2019s that it all matters what you can do in the final.\n\nDespite being out-split on relays this weekend, and barely slipping into the 100 free final tonight in seventh after semifinals, Manuel charged from lane one for the world title. Her time of 52.04 won the gold by nearly four tenths of a second, and it erased her own American record time of 52.27 from the 2017 Worlds.\n\nThis race is obviously reminiscent of her upset win at those 2017 Worlds, where she upset Sweden\u2019s Sarah Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m. The Swede had just set the World Record at 51.71 leading off the 4\u00d7100 free relay earlier in the meet, and out of lane five, Manuel was out in 25.21 (behind only Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Denmark\u2019s Pernille Blume) but came home in a blistering 27.06 to hit the wall at 52.27, just four hundredths ahead of Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m.\n\nThis was also a very different swim from her 2017 performance. Yes, she upset the field. But this time, she did so out of lane one, and she seriously attacked the race, screaming out to a 24.81 first 50 and holding it down on the back half (27.23) to secure the win over Australia\u2019s Cate Campbell (52.43) and Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m (52.46). We\u2019ve grown accustomed to Manuel\u2019s lethal back half, making up ground and making her moves over the final 20 meters or so \u2014 this time, she left it all on the line from the start, and it paid off.\n\nManuel is only the second woman in history to win back-to-back World titles in the 100 free. This hasn\u2019t happened since East Germany\u2019s Kornelia Ender won in both 1973 and 1975. Meanwhile, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m has medaled in the last four editions of this event, taking silver in 2013, 2015, and 2017 and bronze this year.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ps5-has-an-awesome-new-feature-xbox-series-x-cant-match", "authors": ["Richard Priday"], "title": "PS5 has an awesome new feature Xbox Series X can't match", "text": "The PS5 has many flashy features like 3D audio and adaptive triggers, but one of its most useful new additions may have just been accidentally revealed.\n\nPushSquare spotted a feature named Game Presets in a Recommended Settings video published by the PlayStation Support YouTube channel. The menu doesn't actually get covered in the video, but if you pause the video at around 2:27, you can see what options can be preset.\n\nIn recent years, games have been making options like subtitles available before the start of the game, in a similar way to long-standing difficulty selection screens, in order to let players tailor things before even the first cutscene plays. Now you do all of this once at a system level, with PlayStation's video showing you exactly how it's done.\n\nOther adjustable options include different pre-sets for first-person and third-person games, presumably both offering your choice of camera controls for these two styles of gameplay. You can also swap between performance and resolution modes for graphics, depending on if you generally prefer higher framerates or prettier visuals.\n\n(Image credit: PlayStation Support on YouTube)\n\nIt's a thoughtful addition by Sony for sure. We now have to hope that developers arrange their options menus in such a way that they are compatible, otherwise this good idea will go to waste. It's also something we haven't yet seen from the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S, which gives the PS5 an advantage over its rival for third-party games.\n\nAnother PS5-enhanced game\n\nLots of existing games have been announcing their move to the new generation of consoles with revamped graphics and other improvements. And the latest one to announce its changes for PS5 (and Xbox Series X/Xbox Series S too) is Warframe.\n\nThis multiplayer title featuring wall-running space ninjas with simply-too-cool outfits has been popular for several years, and developer Digital Extremes has announced, via the Warframe website. 4K/60fps support for both consoles and much faster loading times.\n\n(Image credit: Digital Extremes)\n\nThat's only the first stage however, as down the road DE has a texture overhaul and dynamic lighting rework planned that will not only make the game look better, but also reduce the size of the game on a console's SSD. An important factor given that both the PS5 and Xbox Series S have had concerns raised about their smaller SSD sizes.\n\nPS5 users will also see some unique additions, like support for the DualSense controller's adaptive triggers (with more haptic feedback features coming later) and for the Activities menu, allowing players to quickly start specific in-game challenges from the main menu. DE has said it will share more about the Xbox Series X version \"very soon,\" so we shall see if Microsoft's console gets any unique features of its own.\n\nThe PS5 goes on sale from November 19, but is right now available to pre-order \u2014 if you can find somewhere that's not sold out already.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/22/2020-predictions-decades-ago-self-driving-cars-mars-voting/2594825001/", "authors": [], "title": "20 predictions for 2020: Here's what people thought would happen by this year", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nJetpacks, disintegrator rays, nuclear energy, Mars.\n\nDecades ago, academics, futurists and government agencies cast their predictions of what would happen by the year 2020. Will submarines reach historic depths? Who will lead future nations, and which ones will be global superpowers? Will Planet Earth even exist as we known it?\n\n\"I shall not be surprised if on my 92nd birthday I am able to go for a ride in an antigravity car,\" mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan wrote in 1968.\n\nSome, like Brennan, were overly optimistic. Others were spot-on. Here's what happened, what didn't and what was just plain crazy.\n\n1. Life expectancy will rise to over 100\n\nFuturist Ray Kurzweil predicted in 1999 that human life expectancy would rise to \"over one hundred\" by 2019.\n\n\"Computerized health monitors built into watches, jewelry, and clothing which diagnose both acute and chronic health conditions are widely used. In addition to diagnosis, these monitors provide a range of remedial recommendations and interventions,\" he wrote in \"The Age of Spiritual Machines.\"\n\nNope: While Kurzweil may have accurately predicted health-related gadgets (such as fitness watches, BioScarves and EKG apps for your smartphone), he jumped the gun on life expectancy.\n\nIn 2019, the average life expectancy of the global population was 72.6 years, according to the United Nations. That average is slightly higher in the U.S., at 78.6 years in 2017, according to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nWhile life expectancy in many industrialized nations continues to inch up, it has been going in the opposite direction in America. The U.N. predicts the average global life expectancy to rise to 77.1 years by 2050.\n\nLife expectancy:What countries have the longest?\n\n2. Computers will be invisible\n\nKurzweil had several other prophecies for the year 2019, including invisible computers.\n\n\"Computers are now largely invisible. They are embedded everywhere \u2014 in walls, tables, chairs, desks, clothing jewelry and bodies. People routinely use three-dimensional displays built into their glasses or contact lenses. ... This display technology projects images directly into the human retina.\"\n\nKeyboards and cables would also become rare, he said.\n\nIt's true \u2014 Computers are embedded everywhere these days. We have smart homes, smart tables, smart chairs, smart desks and more. While we may not project images directly into our retinas, Google Glass comes pretty close.\n\n(Per Kurzweil's previous prediction, scientists are also developing smart contact lenses capable of monitoring the physiological information of the eye and tear fluid and could provide \"real-time, noninvasive medical diagnostics.\" Several groups are testing smart lenses that would measure glucose levels in the tears of people with diabetes.)\n\n3. Books will be dead\n\n\"Papers books and documents are rarely used or accessed. Most twentieth-century paper documents of interest have been scanned and are available through the wireless network,\" Kurzweil predicted.\n\nWrong. While the net revenue of the U.S. book publishing industry has been decreasing since 2014, the industry still sold 675 million print books and brought in nearly $26 billion in 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers annual report.\n\n4. Your every move will be tracked\n\nKurzweil predicted that privacy would be a huge political and social issue and that \"each individual\u2019s practically every move (will be) stored in a database somewhere.\"\n\nTrue, most say. Your TV watches you. Your smartphone follows you. Your web browser traces your digital trail. In an era when some populations worldwide are living under 24/7 high-tech surveillance, most U.S. adults now say they do not think it is possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them by companies or the government, according to a new survey of U.S. adults by Pew Research Center.\n\nMore than 80% say that the potential risks they face because of data collection by companies outweigh the benefits.\n\n5. World's population will reach 8 billion\n\nIn 1994, the International Food Policy Research Institute projected the world population would increase by 2.5 billion to reach 8 billion by 2020. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and the continent of Africa would add another 1.5 billion people, the institute predicted.\n\nClose, but no cigar: The world's population is 7.7 billion, according to a June report from the United Nations. The report expects the population to grow by another 2 billion in the next 30 years. Around 2027, India is projected to overtake China as the world\u2019s most populous country, the report says.\n\n6. China will be the world's largest economy\n\nSpeaking of China... in a 1997 article \"The Long Boom,\" futurists Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden thought China would be on top:\n\n\"By 2020, the Chinese economy has grown to be the largest in the world. Though the U.S. economy is more technologically sophisticated, and its population more affluent, China and the United States are basically on a par,\" they said.\n\nClose. In 2019, China was still trailing the U.S. as the world's second largest economy, by nominal GDP. Recent reports, however, predict that China and India will overtake the U.S. by 2030.\n\n7. We'll have self-driving cars\n\n\"Self driving cars are being experimented with in the late 1990s, with implementation on majors highways feasible during the first decade of the twenty-first century,\" Kurzweil wrote.\n\nKind of. Dozens of companies \u2014 including Tesla, Google spinoff Waymo and ridesharing giants Uber and Lyft \u2014 are still testing self-driving vehicles in select locations, such as Boston, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWidespread use of a truly autonomous vehicle, however, is not yet here: Experts say it might still be decades before we see a car that can drive anywhere it pleases.\n\nSelf-driving shuttle:Why a Rhode Island police officer pulled it over\n\nIn April, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company would have fully self-driving cars ready by the end of the year and a \"robotaxi\" version \u2014 one that can ferry passengers without anyone behind the wheel \u2014 ready for the streets next year. Tesla owners can already \"summon\" their cars, which can drive themselves from parking spots to the curb, where the owner is standing.\n\nWhat about flying cars? Porsche and Boeing are partnering up to create \"premium urban air mobility vehicles,\" and Uber plans to launch a flying taxi service in 2023.\n\n(Planes, meanwhile, are landing themselves.)\n\n8. It will be normal to retire at 70\n\nIn his 1994 book \"The World in 2020,\" British commentator and editor Hamish McRae foresaw retirement ages reaching 67 to 70.\n\n\"The main motive for this in Europe is cost to the state. Governments feel that if retirement ages are not raised, the burden of paying pensions will be so high that working people will not be prepared to pay the tax levels necessary to fund them,\" McRae wrote.\n\nNo: In the U.S., the average retirement age in 2016 was 65 for men and 63 for women, according to the Center for Retirement Research. That number has stayed relatively stagnant for men over the last few decades but has increased for women. For full Social Security benefits, however, the age is slowly climbing and depends on the year that you were born.\n\nSome European countries set 67 as retirement age, the earliest age when citizens can start withdrawing pensions, and several plan to raise the age in the next few years, according to the Finnish Center for Pensions. For many Europeans, the topic is a matter of fierce debate.\n\n9. Americans will vote electronically from home\n\nAs the millennial generation comes of age, they'll be able to vote electronically from home, Schwartz and Leyden predicted \u2014 possibly as soon as the presidential election of 2008.\n\nNot yet. Amid fears of foreign interference in U.S. elections, lawmakers aren't about to let you vote in next year's presidential election on your iPhone. Proponents of online voting, however, say it could improve turnout and prevent voter suppression at polling stations.\n\nStart-ups are developing solutions for online voting, such as the Voatz mobile voting platform, which has used biometric/facial recognition in at least four public election pilots in the U.S. Last year, West Virginia began using Voatz for absentee voting for military personnel stationed overseas. In one Utah county, citizens with a disability were able to vote electronically on their smartphones in a 2019 municipal general election.\n\n10. China will be on a path to democracy\n\nSchwartz and Leyden predicted that, despite taking \"draconian measures\" to avoid an internal crisis in the first decade of the new century, China \"is generally acknowledged to be on a path toward more democratic politics \u2014 though not in the image of the West.\"\n\nNot really. In 2019, China faces increasing scrutiny for human rights abuses against pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and against nearly 1 million Uighurs, a predominantly Muslim population who have been arbitrarily detained and imprisoned in \"re-education\" camps in China's Xinjiang region.\n\n11. We'll have 'personal companions'\n\nIn his 1999 book \"Business @ the Speed of Thought,\" Bill Gates predicted personal devices that \"connect and sync all your devices in a smart way, whether they are at home or in the office, and allow them to exchange data.\"\n\n\"The device will check your email or notifications, and present the information that you need. When you go to the store, you can tell it what recipes you want to prepare, and it will generate a list of ingredients that you need to pick up. It will inform all the devices that you use of your purchases and schedule, allowing them to automatically adjust to what you're doing,\" Gates wrote.\n\nHey, Alexa: Add milk to my shopping list.\n\nWhile Alexa isn't sorting through your emails (that we know of) and your smart thermostat isn't tracking your purchases, Gates isn't far off. Siri, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and an array of smart tech in the Internet of Things now readily exchange data with your other devices and respond to commands.\n\n12. Cars will be able to go months without refueling\n\nSchwartz and Leyden also predicted that, by 2010, \"hydrogen would be processed in refinery-like plants and loaded onto cars that can go thousands of miles \u2014 and many months \u2014 before refueling.\"\n\nBy 2020, they said, almost all new cars would be hybrid vehicles, mostly using hydrogen power.\n\nWhat's the future of the auto industry? Hydrogen cars appear to give way to electric\n\nNot yet. Toyota and Honda are leading the hydrogen-powered car market, but it's an uphill battle against competitors peddling battery-powered electric vehicles. In 2018, 2,300 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles were sold in the U.S. \u2014 less than 1% of the number of electric cars sold, according to InsideEVs, which covers electric vehicle news.\n\nIn other green transportation news: Last year, European railway manufacturer Alstom launched the world\u2019s first hydrogen fuel cell train, and, next year, London is expected to roll out double-decker hydrogen-powered buses.\n\n13. Heart disease, depression will be world's top diseases\n\nIn 1996, the Harvard School of Public Health and the World Health Organization predicted that, by 2020, the world's top two causes of the global burden of disease \u2014 a measurement of the number of healthy life years lost due to sickness, disability or early death \u2014 were expected to be ischemic (coronary) heart disease and unipolar major (clinical) depression.\n\nAt the time, the leading causes were lower respiratory infections (like pnuemonia) and diarrheal diseases, the study said.\n\nClose: In 2017, the most recent year that the data set was published, coronary heart disease was the second leading cause of the global burden of disease, not depression.\n\nThe five leading causes were neonatal disorders, ischaemic heart disease, stroke, lower respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n14. Global surface temperature will increase\n\n(Climate predictions tend to have a longer range, but here's a snapshot of where 2020 stands.)\n\nA 1995 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that the average global surface temperature could increase by about 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) by 2100 (or anywhere between an increase of 1 degrees Celsius to 3.5 degrees Celsius, depending on global emissions).\n\nThe report also predicted that sea level could increase by about 20 inches by the same year.\n\nOn track: With 80 years still to go, both predictions appear possible. The global average temperature has risen a tad more than a 1 degree Fahrenheit (about 0.6 degrees Celsius) since the mid-90s, according to NOAA. And since 1992, the global sea level has risen a total of more than 3 inches, according to NOAA.\n\n15. Humans will step foot on Mars\n\nA 1996 report by the Space Studies Board of the National Research Council said that NASA would launch \"possible human exploratory missions to the moon and Mars within the next quarter century,\" predicting that humans would land on Mars by 2018.\n\nSchwartz and Leyden envision a similar scenario: \"In 2020, humans arrive on Mars ... The four astronauts touch down and beam their images back to the 11 billion people sharing in the moment. The expedition is a joint effort supported by virtually all nations on the planet, the culmination of a decade and a half of intense focus on a common goal.\"\n\nNot quite: While we haven't set foot on Mars, we've landed eight unmanned spacecraft on the planet's surface.\n\n16. Boris Johnson would lead Brexit\n\nIn 1997, British news organization The Independent forecast that in 2020 Boris Johnson would become a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom, a decision-making body composed of the Prime Minister and a team of hand-picked Members of Parliament.\n\nAt the time, Johnson, 32, was known as an outspoken editor and columnist but had not held public office. \"Not shy in clashing with party lines, Boris would 'renegotiate EU membership so Britain stands to Europe as Canada, not Texas, stands to the USA,'\" the journalists wrote.\n\nPretty close: Have you heard of Brexit? Johnson became Prime Minister in July 2019. He first served in the Cabinet starting in 2016 as foreign secretary under Theresa May. In December, Johnson led his Conservative Party to victory in a national election on the promise to \"get Brexit done.\"\n\n17. Antigravity belts will revolutionize warfare\n\nImagine a world where battles are fought just a few feet above the ground, as soldiers hover in mid-air. In 1968, mathematician and scientist D.G. Brennan predicted that antigravity belts would \"revolutionize the tactics of land warfare,\" writing that \"even if the antigravity mechanism did not itself provide horizontal propulsion, relatively modest sources of thrust could easily be provided.\"\n\nHe also suspected that, by 2018, humans would have antigravity cars and jetpacks capable of operating for 30 minutes.\n\nNo. (Unless you're Luke Skywalker or Buzz Lightyear.)\n\n18. Nuclear will replace natural gas\n\nIn 1968, Stanford University professor Charles Scarlott predicted that nuclear breeder reactors would make up the majority of U.S. energy production by 2018 as natural gas fades.\n\n\"Energy from water power, solar radiation, the wind, tides, or earth heat will not figure large in the totals. Power from nuclear power plants should be available in large amounts at low cost,\" Scarlott wrote.\n\nWrong: In 2018, fossil fuels \u2014 petroleum, natural gas and coal \u2014 accounted for about 79% of total U.S. primary energy production in 2018, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. About 12% was from renewable energy sources, and about 9% was from nuclear electric power.\n\n19. Americans will work 26 hours a week\n\nIn 1968, it was thought that, by 2020, Americans would work 1,370 hours a year (or 26 hours a week), instead of the 1,940 hours (37 hours a week) that was average at the time, according to physicist Herman Kahn and futurist Anthony J. Weiner.\n\nUnlikely: While we are working less than we were in 1968, the average American worked nearly 1,800 hours in 2018 (35 hours a week), according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\n20. Nationalism will wane\n\nIn the same 1968 text, Ithiel de Sola Pool, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, predicted that better communication, easier translation and greater understanding of the nature of human motivations would make it easier for people to connect across ethnic and national lines.\n\n\"By the year 2018 nationalism should be a waning force in the world. The increasing openness about feelings and identifications may help men to overcome some of the more destructive and hostile motivations that underlie nationalism,\" he wrote.\n\nThe opposite is true. Fueled by backlash against immigration, globalization and the political establishment, populist nationalism was a driving force behind Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and the rise of right-wing politicians in France, Austria, Italy, Hungary and Poland, among other countries, academics say.\n\n\"Everywhere one looks, in fact, one sees nationalism at work in today\u2019s world,\" Stephen Walt, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, wrote in Foreign Policy Magazine.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/30/apples-iphone-sales-miss-estimates-down-13percent-versus-last-year.html", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "title": "Apple's iPhone sales miss estimates, down 12% versus last year", "text": "Apple reported earnings for fiscal third quarter Tuesday. The company reported iPhone revenue of $25.99 billion.

Apple reported iPhone revenue of $29.47 billion in revenue on 41.3 million iPhones sold in the year-ago quarter.\n\nCEO Tim Cook said on Apple's earnings call that he's \"encouraged by in-store trade-in and finance programs\" for the iPhone that customers are taking advantage of, and that the \"active install base of iPhone reached an all-time high.\" Cook did not provide a specific number of iPhone users, however.\n\nApple no longer provides a breakout on iPhone unit sales, which means the revenue figures are the easiest way to get a glimpse at iPhone performance.\n\nThe iPhone has struggled in recent years as consumers have shown they're not as interested in spending upwards of $1,000 on a new phone, as as people continue to hold on to their phones for three or four years instead of upgrading every one or two years.\n\nTo try to offset this trend, Apple has put a larger focus on its services business, which is one area investors are hoping to see continued growth, particularly with new services such as Apple TV Channels and Apple News+, which are already available, and upcoming products such as the Apple Card and Apple TV+. The company has also offered better deals if customers trade in their old iPhone for a new one.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated with the correct iPhone revenue for Apple's fiscal third-quarter 2019.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a29963551/cameron-mathison-hallmark-movie-kidney-cancer/", "authors": ["Rebecca Norris", "Rebecca Norris Is An Nyc-Based Writer Who Specializes In All Aspects Of Lifestyle Content", "Ranging Beauty", "Wellness To Home"], "title": "Cameron Mathison Says Hallmark's The Christmas Club May Have Saved His Life", "text": "The Christmas Club star Cameron Mathison was diagnosed with kidney cancer this year.\n\nHe's now cancer-free, and is opening up about how his new Christmas movie led him to get his life-saving MRI.\n\nHallmark star Cameron Mathison is a good reminder to pay attention to the little things in life.\n\nOn September 10, The Christmas Club star shared news of his kidney cancer.

Every time you get in your Tesla, there could be a pleasant surprise in store. What new useful (or whimsical) feature have Elon and his merry pranksters come up with this week?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just great to be able to have a car that\u2019s four years old, as mine is now, and have all the features of a new car,\u201d Elaine Borseth, a Model S owner and Vice President of the Electric Vehicle Association of San Diego, told USA Today. \u201cYou get a notification. You go out to your car and you have new features.\u201d\n\nA recent article in USA Today lists some (but by no means all) of the features that Tesla has added to its vehicles via over-the-air updates. Some of them are practical capabilities that no vehicle has ever had before. Sentry Mode, which Tesla started rolling out in 2019, records video whenever someone gets close to the vehicle. As a growing number of user videos attest, Sentry Mode has already foiled several attempted robberies and brought some hit-and-run vandals to justice.\n\nDog Mode, also launched in 2019, is another useful feature \u2014 it keeps the passenger cabin at a comfortable temperature for pets, so that humans can get errands done without having to bring Bowser or Buffy along. It also displays the internal temperature and a message saying, \u201cMy owner will be back soon. Don\u2019t worry!\u201d so you don\u2019t have to worry about Good Samaritans smashing your windows.\n\nOther handy features that have recently appeared: Enhanced Summon, which might allow you to park in an extra-narrow space, or avoid getting rained on (we expect to see all kinds of other uses for this one popping up on YouTube soon); Stop Light Warning, which cautions you if you\u2019re about to blow through a red light (although it doesn\u2019t apply the brakes); and Valet Mode, which hides personal data from the touchscreen, locks the frunk and glove compartment, and limits maximum speed.\n\nTesla has also steadily improved the performance of its vehicles via remote updates. The famous Ludicrous Mode, which makes Model S the fastest-accelerating production sedan every built, was delivered over the air, as was Track Mode, which turns the Model 3 Performance model into a drift car. And for those who may not be comfortable with the ever-increasing speed and acceleration, there\u2019s Chill Mode, which Tesla says is \u201cideal for smoother driving and a gentler ride for your passengers.\u201d\n\nA look at how software updates work on a Tesla (YouTube: Lexi Heft)\n\nFeatures like this add functionality and fun, and alleviate some of the little problems of car ownership, but as handy as they are, there are other updates that promise to be nothing less than revolutionary. The features that come under the heading of Autopilot are leading us toward a complete redefinition of our relationship with cars \u2014 which will mean a radical rearrangement of human society.\n\nThe Navigate on Autopilot feature, which Tesla demonstrated at the recent Autonomy Investor Day, allows a vehicle to drive itself on the highway, from on-ramp to off-ramp. Autopilot-equipped Teslas could already change lanes on their own, but the driver had to initiate the lane change using the turn signal stalk. Now drivers have the option of letting the car make lane changes on its own. It\u2019s one more step toward the goal of fully autonomous driving, which Musk is now promising by the end of this year.\n\nThe next step will be the Tesla Network, a fleet of self-driving \u201crobotaxis\u201d that can earn revenue for Tesla owners when they aren\u2019t driving their vehicles. When and if Tesla gets this up and running, it will transform the company, giving it a major new revenue source and putting it firmly in the lead of the developing Transportation as a Service (TaaS) market. And that will be just the beginning.\n\nSaving the world is important, but as Elon Musk says, \u201cLife\u2019s got to be about more than solving problems.\u201d Tesla vehicles are the first cars to be endowed with their own puckish sense of humor. To confirm that you really want to select Launch Mode, you must choose between \u201cYes, bring it on!\u201d and \u201cNo, I want my mommy!\u201d There\u2019s a steady stream of fun features, games, and Easter eggs, many of them referencing bits of pop culture familiar to those of us who are in Elon\u2019s age group.\n\nThere\u2019s the Back to the Future update for the Tesla mobile app, which lets you turn your Model X into a time-traveling DeLorean; TeslATARI, which lets you play cheesy 1980s video games on your vehicle\u2019s touchscreen; and, of course, Emissions Testing Mode, which is designed not to cheat emissions testing devices but to get laughs from kids of all ages with a variety of farty sound effects.\n\nTesla\u2019s \u201cRomance Mode\u201d in action (YouTube: Zach Bowman)\n\nFor the holidays, there\u2019s Santa Mode, which makes your turn signals sound like jingling sleigh bells, and Romance Mode, which displays a video of a fire crackling in the hearth.\n\nDo you have any favorites that we missed?\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: I\u2019ve got a favorite not mentioned here, but I\u2019ll wait to see if anyone else chimes in to cheer it on.]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/23/confederate-statues-trump-issue-order-protecting-federal-monuments/3241036001/", "authors": [], "title": "Trump vows to issue executive order protecting statues, says it would 'reinforce' current law", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to issue an executive order to protect statues and other historical monuments from destruction by \u201choodlums\u201d and \u201canarchists.\u201d\n\nTrump offered no details about the order, saying \u201cI will have an executive order very shortly.

The statue is one of several across the country that have been targeted by protesters following the death of George Floyd.\n\nThe Veterans Memorial Preservation Act, a federal law passed in 2003, already makes it a crime to destroy or attempt to destroy a plaque, monument or statue \"commemorating the service\" of anyone who served in the armed forces. The law carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.\n\nTrump said several people already have been jailed for trying to remove the Andrew Jackson statute and that others would be charged soon.\n\nThe statue shows Jackson in a military uniform, riding a horse that is rearing on its hind legs. The 19th century president's ruthless treatment of Native Americans has made his statue a target of demonstrators protesting the United States' legacy of racial injustice.\n\nThe Secret Service and police officers intervened before the statue was toppled, Trump said.\n\nEarlier Tuesday,Trump tweeted that he has authorized the federal government to arrest anyone who destroys, vandalizes or destroys any monument or statue on federal property.\n\n\u201cThese are not protesters,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThese are anarchists.\u201d\n\nConfederate statue :'We hear your voices': Jacksonville takes down 122-year-old Confederate monument on historic day in Florida's largest city", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.etonline.com/priyanka-chopra-photoshops-herself-into-awkward-vmas-moment-with-husband-nick-jonas-131379", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "title": "Priyanka Chopra Photoshops Herself Into Awkward VMAs Moment With Husband Nick Jonas", "text": "The Jonas Brothers had a big night at this year's MTV Video Music Awards, first with their remote performance from Asbury Park before they later won for Best Pop Song for \"Sucker.\"\n\nHowever, their moment of victory also seemed to be one of the night's most relatable awkward moments for Nick Jonas, who went solo to the star-studded event.\n\nWhile Joe Jonas received a congratulatory kiss from wife Sophie Turner, and Kevin Jonas got an adorable peck from wife Danielle, Nick was stuck laughing uncomfortably with his hands by his sides and a semi-embarrassed smile on his face.\n\nHAHAHAHAH NICK JONAS IS ALL OF US https://t.co/hpE7fzWzip\n\nHowever, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who was unable to attend the awards show, still served as one of the band's loudest supporters and tried to correct the awkwardness with some hilariously adorable (and charmingly bad) photoshopping.\n\n\"I\u2019m always with you @nickjonas \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude0dCongratulations @jonasbrothers!

People immediately crowd around, and keep entering the church, despite efforts to keep them out. One woman tugs at Pirzada's sleeve, demanding food. \"Please wait five minutes, mother!\" Pirzada says. \"I've been waiting 10!\" she snaps.\n\nAnother woman lingers outside, hoping for food, but she's not on Pirzada's distribution list of 35 families.

Like the previous order, which went into effect on May 6, it covers, among other things, grocery stores, pharmacies, and retail stores; public transportation, taxis, livery, and ridesharing vehicles.\n\nThe new order also covers any location that hosts indoor or outdoor events or performances, carpools with non-household members \u2014 and \u201cpublic streets and ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re basically saying, \u2018If you go out in public, wear a mask,\u2019\u201d Baker said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMartin finucane can be reached at martin.finucane@globe.com.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-first-character-killed/", "authors": ["Reuben Baron", "Anthony Gramuglia", "Evangelia Galanis", "Sam Stone"], "title": "Who Was the First Character to Be Killed in a Marvel Comic?", "text": "In \"When We First Met,\" we spotlight the various characters, phrases, objects or events that eventually became notable parts of comic lore, like the first time someone said, \"Avengers Assemble!\" or the first appearance of Batman's giant penny or the first appearance of Alfred Pennyworth or the first time Spider-Man's face was shown half-Spidey/half-Peter.

She's been humiliated.

'A favourite of face-and-career-saving politicians, who would often involve their entire family in the Walton's-style shots, the public have become cynical as a result of so many of them emerging just prior to a split.'

It's a huge thing to be coming to terms with.\n\n'She has since told the people closest to her their marriage is as good as over now and she doesn't think there is a way past this.'\n\nMailOnline contacted representatives for Dominic and Lily for further comment at the time.\n\nLast month, old Etonian West confirmed his wife Catherine, had gone away, but explained: 'She's on a work trip. She's gone by herself.'\n\nWhen asked if they were still together, he laughed: 'Of course we are. Our relationship is fine.'\n\nMeanwhile, Dominic made his feelings on infidelity quite clear during an Evening Standard interview, back in 2016, when he asked the reporter why wives make such a fuss over infidelity.\n\nHe said: 'I really do. It's daft to kick someone out over a fling. Isn't it? Everyone should turn a blind eye to men's behaviour between the ages of 40 and 50. Let it all blow over.'\n\nTV and film stars Dominic and Lily became the subject of worldwide scrutiny, when the images emerged showing the pair enjoying an al fresco lunch with their mutual agent, Angharad Wood.\n\nLily and Dominic enjoyed a two-day vacation in Italy where they were seen riding on a scooter through Rome, and The Affair star appeared to at one point lean over and kiss her neck.\n\nBizarre: The couple handed out this note to reporters insisting they were together\n\nA source told MailOnline they spent two nights in a suite at the top Hotel De La Ville with a panoramic view over the city and just at two minutes walk from the Spanish steps. Just days later, the father-of-five and his wife defended their marriage.\n\nThis came hours after Catherine told friends she was 'heartbroken' over the images, which went viral.\n\nThe shell-shocked mother-of-four had clutched a tissue in her hand as she gingerly stepped out of the marital home in Chippenham, Wiltshire with her husband by her side, hiding her ring finger in her jeans pocket.\n\nDominic's ring was off as it had been for his weekend with Lily.\n\nIt was previously reported that Catherine held crisis talks with her family over the future of her marriage.\n\nThe couple - who tied the knot in June 2010 after reuniting following their university romance - share Dora, 13, Senan, 12, Francis, 11, and Christabel, seven, together.\n\nWhile the Sheffield native has another daughter Martha, 21, with former girlfriend, aristocrat, Polly Astor.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.droid-life.com/2019/07/12/deal-wireless-earbuds-bt-5-0/", "authors": [], "title": "DEAL: 50% Off These Wireless Earbuds With Bluetooth 5.0, Down to $18", "text": "Over on Amazon, you can now snag a pair of wireless earbuds with Bluetooth 5.0 from Syllable for just $18, down from their usual price of $36.

The bank said the change will also free up staff to handle a surge in mortgage refinance requests, which are taking longer to process due to staff working from home and non-essential businesses being closed.\n\nRefinancing requests jumped to their highest level in more than a decade last month as average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular home loan, fell to near record lows, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).\n\nJPMorgan would not disclose the current minimum requirements for its various mortgage products, but the average down payment across the housing market is around 10%, according to the MBA.\n\nThe new credit standards do not apply to JPMorgan's roughly four million existing mortgage customers, or to low and moderate income borrowers who qualify for its \"DreaMaker\" product, which requires a minimum 3% down payment and 620 credit score.\n\nThe U.S. housing market had been on a steady footing earlier this year, but with a deepening recession and would-be home buyers unable to view properties or close purchases due to social distancing measures, the health crisis now threatens to derail the sector.\n\nThe residential mortgage market is already under strain after borrower requests to delay mortgage payments rose 1,900% in the second half of March, Reuters reported.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors last month said home sales could fall by around 10% in the short-term, compared to historical sales for this time of year. A Federal Reserve March consumer survey said home prices were expected grow 1.32% over the year, the lowest reading since the survey began in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Elizabeth Dilts Marshall; Editing by Michelle Price and Daniel Wallis)", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/world/europe/no-scrooge-here-johnson-resists-canceling-christmas-to-stem-coronavirus.html", "authors": ["Mark Landler", "Stephen Castle"], "title": "No Scrooge Here: Johnson Resists \u2018Canceling\u2019 Christmas to Stem Coronavirus", "text": "LONDON \u2014 In a year of hard decisions about how to confront the coronavirus, perhaps none has proved as anguished for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as whether to ban Britons from getting together for a little Christmas cheer.\n\nFor weeks, British tabloids have speculated darkly that Mr. Johnson would be forced to \u201ccancel Christmas.\u201d Some noted he would the first British leader to do so since Oliver Cromwell tried to stamp out Yuletide merrymaking during the ascetic days of the Puritan movement in the mid-17th century.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Johnson stuck by his pledge to lift some important restrictions for a few precious days between Dec. 23 and 27 \u2014 a decision that attests to his deep-seated desire not to be seen as the Ebenezer Scrooge of Downing Street, as well as to the atavistic appeal of the Christmas holiday in this otherwise secular country.\n\nMr. Johnson has not wavered even after new cases surged in London, which prompted the government to put the capital under stricter rules between now and Dec. 23.

However, we can certainly notice trends along the way and the current trend for the Intel Comet Lake-H series versus the AMD Renoir-H series is leaning more and more towards AMD's favor.\n\nWe've reviewed 7 laptops with octa-core Comet Lake-H or Ryzen 7 Renoir-H processors thus far and the systems running on AMD hardware have been consistently edging out their Intel counterparts in multi-threaded workloads. The Blender rendering benchmark, for example, finishes almost 40 seconds faster on the AMD-powered Eluktronics RP-15 when compared to the fastest Core i7-10875H laptop currently in our database. CineBench multi-thread results are also about 15 percent higher on average with the Ryzen 7 4800H.\n\nThe key area where Intel still holds the advantage is in single-threaded or single-core operations. The 7-Zip compression/decompression benchmark, for example, runs 15 percent faster on Intel hardware when set to a single core while the opposite is true when all cores are enabled.\n\nThe main challenge for Intel is that more applications and games are beginning to better exploit multi-core setups meaning any advantages in single-thread operations will become less relevant to most gamers and content creators over time. If you're in the market for a high-performance octa-core laptop, it's going to be difficult to recommend an Intel Comet Lake-H platform especially when you start to factor in the price parity between it and the Ryzen 7 4800H.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/453481-trump-thanks-vicious-young-socialist-congresswomen-for-his-poll", "authors": [], "title": "Trump thanks 'vicious young Socialist Congresswomen' for his poll numbers", "text": "President Trump Donald John TrumpPompeo changes staff for Russia meeting after concerns raised about top negotiator's ties: report House unravels with rise of 'Les Enfants Terrible' Ben Carson: Trump is not a racist and his comments were not racist MORE on Wednesday thanked the four Democratic congresswomen he targeted in tweets many considered racist after a conservative-leaning poll showed his approval rating at 50 percent.\n\nTrump tweeted that the \"vicious young Socialist Congresswomen\" whom he urged to \"go back\" to the \"countries\" they came from were responsible for his Rasmussen daily tracking poll numbers increasing by 4 percent since Monday.\n\n\"New Poll: The Rasmussen Poll, one of the most accurate in predicting the 2016 Election, has just announced that \u201cTrump\u201d numbers have recently gone up by four points, to 50%.

Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., during the Clinton impeachment proceedings resurfaced this week, illustrating how the Judiciary Committee chairman has reversed his stance on impeachment now that that an inquiry has been activated into President Donald Trump.\n\nGraham, an ardent ally of President Trump, sponsored a resolution that has been co-signed by all but three Senate Republicans decrying the House impeachment probe. He told Fox News host Sean Hannity in October that any articles of impeachment against Trump should be \u201cdismissed in the Senate without a trial.\u201d He also called the impeachment inquiry proceedings a \u201clynching in every sense.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe video from 1998, when Graham was one of the Republican House members pushing to impeach President Bill Clinton, shows that Graham was once staunchly against members of Congress dismissing impeachment before seeing all of the facts.\n\n\"Some people have said, 'I won't vote for impeachment.' Some House members have said, 'I will not vote for an impeachment,'\" Graham said at the time. \"Let me tell you, please don't say that until you understand what you're voting on.\"\n\n\"Members of the Senate have said, 'I understand everything there is about this case, and I won't vote to impeach the president.' Please allow the facts to do the talking,\u201d he continued. \"Nobody knows what the articles of impeachment are. People have made up their mind in a political fashion that will hurt this country long term.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHe concluded with a plea: \u201cIf you can't vote for impeachment, give us the due justice to the case. Don't decide the case before the case is in. And this bothers me greatly.\"\n\nThe comments are in stark contrast to what Graham told Hannity last month about the ongoing impeachment proceedings against Trump.\n\n\"What's happening in the House is basically un-American,\" he said in October. \u201cI don\u2019t want to legitimize it \u2026 I would like Republicans to say, 'This is a bunch of garbage.\u2019\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that comments Graham made during the Clinton impeachment have come back to haunt him.\n\nAfter Graham defended Trump for issuing a blanket refusal to comply with any congressional subpoenas, a clip resurfaced of the senator decrying the Clinton administration for not complying with House subpoenas.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cWhen asked for information, Richard Nixon chose not to comply and the Congress back in that time said you're taking impeachment away from us,\" Graham said in 1998. \"The day Richard Nixon failed to answer that subpoena is that day that he was subject to impeachment because he took the power from Congress over the impeachment process away from Congress and he became the judge and jury.\"\n\nAnd Graham isn't the only Republican whose past comments sound very different in light of the Trump impeachment hearings. Earlier this week, Politico reporter Ryan Lizza re-published an excerpt of an interview he conducted with Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who has turned the Trump impeachment hearings into a forum for right-wing conspiracy theories, as he did with the House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cThis may surprise people who only know Devin Nunes\u2019s recent record, but in late 2015 Nunes told me during a long interview in his office that he was extremely concerned about the rise of conspiracy theorists in the Republican Party,\u201d Lizza tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe interview showed Nunes complaining that he used to get messages from constituents about policy details, with only a small number of them referring to every \u201cconspiracy theory that\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has essentially flipped on its head,\u201d Nunes lamented, explaining that few constituents now send mail \u201cbased on something that is mostly true.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dramatically changed politics and politicians, and what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://alabama.rivals.com/news/observations-from-nick-saban-s-press-conference-1", "authors": ["Kyle Henderson", "Managing Editor", "Article.Author_Name"], "title": "Observations from Nick Saban's Press Conference", "text": "Here are some observations from Nick Saban\u2019s Monday press conference. Saban opened up talking about resiliency and used the analogy of a boxer that gets punched in the mouth and keeps fighting.\n\nObservations: Saban talked about Alabama facing a character check before the Duke game and during the first three possessions of the game, the Crimson Tide had a find a way to keep fighting and they did just that winning 42-3. The first game of the season always presents challenges as there are new faces, new schemes, and no identity for the team as a whole. Saban also said that you do not develop an identity after one game.\n\nOn New Mexico State. The Aggies were defeated by Washington State in week one by a score of 58-7. This week the Aggies are a 54.5 underdog against Alabama. Saban said that NMSU is a team that likes to spread the ball out\n\n\n\nObservations: This will be a good opportunity for the Crimson Tide\u2019s defensive secondary to improve and all eyes will be on Josh Jobe\u2019s progression as he had a tough time in coverage against Duke during Saturday\u2019s game. Saban also said that they are looking forward to the home opener and they (team) really appreciate all the fan support at home.\n\nOn the running game. The Crimson Tide ran for just 145-yards against Duke and never really established a running game. Saban said that a variety of things did not go right and that reflected on the run game.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain way you\u2019re supposed to run the ball on certain plays,\u201d Saban said. \u201cYou have to trust and have confidence in that. And that\u2019s the thing we want to focus on with those guys to be able to do. If that takes rhythm to do that, then we need to improve their rhythm. If it takes more eye control and eye discipline to see what you\u2019re supposed to see and respond that way, then that\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d\n\nObservations: Saban is not directing the blame at the offensive line or the running backs, he\u2019s directing the lack of running game to poor execution from the players. Follow through with your blocks, stay on your man, run behind your lead blocker and don\u2019t bounce outside.

Though Roku previously carried Fox channels, the service tweeted that it had pulled those channels Friday morning due to its distribution contract expiring. In a statement to IndieWire, Roku representatives said the game will stream for free on the NFL channel on Roku devices \u2014 unless Fox blocks it.\n\nA Roku spokesperson told IndieWire that \u201cRoku\u2019s distribution agreement with Fox Corp is set to expire on January 31. We offered Fox an extension so that Roku can continue to bring a large and valuable audience to Fox, but Fox declined. If an agreement is not reached, we will be forced to remove Fox channels from the Roku platform. We will no longer have the legal right to distribute their content.\u201d\n\nFOX representatives did not return a request for comment, but a Fox spokesperson told Deadline that \u201cFox has not asked Roku to remove our apps, and we would prefer Roku continue to make them available without interruption.\u201d\n\nJennifer Lopez and Shakira will co-headline the game\u2019s halftime show and Demi Lovato will perform \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d before kickoff.

However, which fight is the most important fight in Conor\u2019s career?\n\nThe journey of Conor McGregor in the world of mixed martial arts has been spectacular, to say the least. Conor made history by becoming the two-division champion at Cage Warrior.\n\nConor was just getting started as he brought the Irish invasion to UFC after his illustrious run at Cage Warriors.\n\nConor would run through the UFC featherweight division and dethrone the long-reigning champion, Jose Aldo securing a monumental victory. The Notorious One would then go on to win his second UFC title to become the first-ever two-division champion in UFC.\n\nConor McGregor looks back at the win over Nate Diaz\n\nHowever, for Conor, none of those wins can match the victory over Nate Diaz. Conor McGregor suffered his first loss against Nate Diaz. For the first time in his UFC career, Conor faced adversity inside the octagon. But it turned out that the loss against Diaz would give birth to arguably the biggest fight of Conor\u2019s career.\n\nFight fans love a good comeback story. And that\u2019s what they witnessed when Conor faced Nate Diaz in a much-anticipated rematch. Conor secured a split decision win over Diaz after a 5 round war. That rematch went into the history book as one of the biggest fights in MMA.\n\nAnd recently when Conor came across the fight on social media he could not help but react to it with the below tweet.\n\nUFC 202: McGregor Vs Diaz 2 on @btsport now!  Incredible fight!  The most important of my life.\n\nMany fans might argue that the fight against Jose Aldo and the fight against Eddie Alvarez was the most important fight of Conor\u2019s career. However, Conor calls Diaz rematch the most important fight of his career and rightfully so. The rivalry between Conor and Nate was intense going into the second fight and Conor had the last laugh by securing the win in the rematch.\n\nHowever, it can be argued that the biggest fight of Conor\u2019s career is yet to come. If Conor takes on Khabib Nurmagomedov in a rematch for the UFC lightweight title, then that will be a fight Conor would not want to lose. A win over Khabib Nurmagomedov will surely cement Conor\u2019s legacy as one of the greatest to ever step into the octagon.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Sun Mar 29 20:37:18 +0000 2020", "id": 1244363022811967491, "id_str": "1244363022811967491", "full_text": "UFC 202: McGregor Vs Diaz 2 on @btsport now! \nIncredible fight! \nThe most important of my life.", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 95], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [{"screen_name": "btsport", "name": "BT Sport", "id": 124189302, "id_str": "124189302", "indices": [31, 39]}], "urls": []}, "source": "<a href=\"http://twitter.com/download/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for iPhone</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 369583954, "id_str": "369583954", "name": "Conor McGregor", "screen_name": "TheNotoriousMMA", "location": "Dublin, Ireland", "description": "Two division UFC World Champion.

Crystal Vander Weit and Jasper Colt, USA TODAY\n\nDrug overdose deaths last year dropped for the first time in nearly three decades, according to a report this week from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe provisional data, still subject to change when final number are released later this year, show overdose deaths fell 5% in 2018, the first major decline during an addiction epidemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of people this decade.\n\n\"The latest provisional data on overdose deaths show that America\u2019s united efforts to curb opioid use disorder and addiction are working,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement. \"Lives are being saved, and we\u2019re beginning to win the fight against this crisis.\"\n\n'People are dying of opioid overdose not knowing they have taken opioids'\n\nWhile the drop is encouraging, experts say more than 68,000 deaths last year from drug overdoses remains a significant public health challenge.\n\nThe opioid oxycodone-acetaminophen. (Photo: Patrick Sison, AP)\n\n\"It's great that it's moving in the right direction,\" says Adam Leventhal, director of the University of Southern California's Institute for Addiction Science. \"It's important that the public and policymakers recognize that the addiction crisis is unfortunately still alive and well. It's just shifting.\"\n\nPrescription opioid painkillers, long blamed as the root of the crisis, are fading as a cause of drug overdose deaths. The CDC reported 12,757 overdose deaths from prescription painkillers in 2018, down from 14,926 deaths in 2017. Four other drug categories \u2013 methampetamine and other stimulants, cocaine, heroin and fentanyl \u2013 each caused more fatal overdoses last year than opioids such as oxycodone and Vicodin last year, the report said.\n\nFentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid often sold as a street drug, surpassed prescription opioids in 2015 as the most lethal overdose substance and now is linked to nearly three times as many deaths. Nearly 32,000 overdose deaths last year involved fentanyl. In 2014, it was detected in fewer than 6,000 fatal overdoses.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Protection shows U.S. overdoses on the rise due to fentanyl, a synthetic opioid. (Photo: CDC)\n\nAlthough the data attributes individual drug categories to deaths based on a coding system, overdoses increasingly include multiple substances.\n\nDr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former health secretary of Maryland and health commissioner of Baltimore, said that this new phase of the addiction epidemic is creating new challenges.\n\n\"A major concern is people are dying of opioid overdose not knowing they have taken opioids,\" said Sharfstein, vice dean at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"They think they are getting cocaine or they think they are getting methamphetamine. People might not have Narcan handy because why would they need it?\"\n\nMore: Naloxone can reverse opioid overdoses, but does the drug belong in elementary schools?\n\nThe federal government and state health departments have spent millions to purchase the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone \u2013 or Narcan, the brand name for the nasal spray version. Naloxone reverses an opioid overdose if administered in time, but it does not counteract other drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine.\n\nThe federal government also has sought to expand access to medication-assisted treatment drugs buprenorphine, naltrexone and methadone to wean people off of opioids.\n\n'The addiction crisis in America is not solved'\n\nThere's been a national push to raise awareness among both doctors and patients about the potential harm of inappropriate prescribing. Total opioid prescribing has declined since 2012. The CDC issued an influential chronic pain guideline in 2016 to inform the public about appropriate prescribing.\n\nBut in a New England Journal of Medicine editorial last month, a panel of experts cited examples such as inflexible thresholds on dosages, abrupt tapering and misapplication of the guideline for people with cancer, sickle cell disease or recovering from surgery.\n\nMore: Pain patients left in anguish by doctors 'terrified' of opioid addiction, despite CDC change\n\nMore: 'Fighting the wrong war': Chronic pain patients push feds to change opioid policies\n\nLeventhal, of USC, said that the addiction crisis has shifted to a more complex era.\n\n\"The addiction crisis in America is not solved,\" Leventhal said. \"It has morphed into a polysubstance use crisis. Something we need to be really concerned about is the increase in stimulant-related deaths, including cocaine, methamphetamine and other amphetamine derivatives.\"\n\nCLOSE The data shows that substance use disorder is still widespread, but innovations in treatment, prescribing and awareness are helping.

Similar claims appeared on social media platforms in May \u2014 and have been debunked \u2014 after Congress introduced a bill focused on contact tracing and increased testing.\n\nMore:Apple and Google release coronavirus contact tracing technology for public health mobile apps\n\nThe user who shared the post did not respond to USA TODAY for comment.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has previously stated that contact tracing is a key strategy for COVID-19 prevention because it aims to identify and notify those who may have been exposed.\n\nExposure notifications explained\n\nOn May 20, Apple and Google announced that COVID-19 exposure notifications, a mobile tool that allows for digital contact tracing, were available for use on iOS and Android devices.\n\nThe new technology can track users who are in the proximity of someone for at least five minutes who has tested positive for the virus and anonymously notify users through Bluetooth technology. Participation is completely voluntary.\n\nOpinion:I'm a coronavirus contact tracer. Asking vulnerable people to stay home isn't always easy.\n\n\"Each user gets to decide whether or not to opt-in to exposure notifications; the system does not collect or use location from the device; and if a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, it is up to them whether or not to report that in the public health app,\" a news release from Google and Apple states. The companies noted that \"strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps.\"\n\nHere's how it works: With your consent, if you test positive for the coronavirus, anyone who was near you within the past 14 days will get a notification on their smartphone that they have been potentially exposed. The notification will read: \"You have recently come into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Tap for more information.\"\n\nThe effectiveness of the technology largely depends on who is carrying their phones with them and keeping their phones active, on how many people \u2013 once they learn they have tested positive for the virus \u2013 decide to use the technology to let others know they may have been exposed, and how many people \u2013 once they receive an alert about possible exposure \u2013 follow public health protocols about testing, self-isolation and additional contact tracing.\n\nThe technology would assist public health officials and authorities in lifting social distancing measures or responding to new outbreaks that appear.\n\nFact check:What's true and what's false about coronavirus?\n\nPrivacy concerns addressed\n\nApple told USA TODAY that use is strictly voluntary, user location is not collected and that the technology is used only for exposure notifications. The technology can simply be turned off or uninstalled after it is no longer needed.\n\nIn a frequently asked questions about the exposure notifications, Google has assured that each user will have to explicitly choose to turn on the technology and that it can be turned off at any time. The system rotates privacy beacons every 10-20 minutes to prevent tracking, and the system is only used for contact tracing by public health authorities' apps, which must meet certain criteria related to privacy, security and data control.\n\n\"The choice to use this technology rests with the user, and he or she can turn it off at any time by uninstalling the contact tracing application or turning off exposure notification in Settings,\" the companies stated in their guide.\n\nGoogle and Apple themselves do not have access to information related to any specific individual through the technology and access is only granted to health authorities who meet the criteria.\n\n\"In keeping with our privacy guidelines, Apple and Google will not receive identifying information about the user, location data, or information about any other devices the user has been in proximity of,\" Apple and Google said.\n\nOur rating: Partly false\n\nThe claim that all Android smartphone users have been automatically signed up for a COVID-19 app is rated PARTLY FALSE because some of it was not supported by our research. Apple and Google did recently add exposure notifications to devices under Settings, but the contact tracing technology only works if one has opted in and enabled the notifications. Apple and Google have both stated that privacy is an essential part of the contact tracing technology and there is no evidence to support the claim that Android users are automatically being signed up for the exposure notifications.

Valeria's mother, Tania Vanessa Avalos, watched as her family was swept away.\n\nJulia Le Duc, a journalist working for La Jornada, took a photo that showed Ramirez and his daughter face down by the riverbank. The child was tucked into her father's shirt, her arm still around his neck. The image went viral and shed light on restrictive U.S. government policies like metering that have pushed some desperate migrants to risk crossing the river between ports of entry.\n\nThe vigil at Brownsville's Hope Park was only about a mile from where the bodies were found.\n\nPhotos of the Salvadoran family rested on a table. People held signs and others held candles that were lit during the vigil.\n\nJoyce Hamilton, a member of the group Angry Tias and Abuelas, spoke to the crowd. \"On the way here tonight,\" she said, \"all I could think is that there's no way I could talk tonight because this whole past week or so has been just so crushing.\"\n\nOrganizations like Angry Tias and Abuelas regularly help migrants in Mexico and in the U.S. They worked with other groups to organize the vigils.\n\nGabriela Zavala, the executive director of a respite center at a local church, took a turn speaking at the vigil.\n\n\"We only know a few things about them,\" she said, \"but we do know this. We know that they, like many immigrants before them and many immigrants after them, made the ultimate sacrifice to leave their counties behind to brave a dangerous trek in search of safety and a better life.\"\n\nZavala says their deaths were the result of a failed immigration system and called on the community to demand from their elected officials better representation for the needs of all at the border.\n\n\"Demand that they end family separation and detention, and that they hold our leaders accountable for terrible policymaking,\" said Zavala. \"Policies like metering that keeps our asylum seekers waiting in Mexico, despite the knowledge that they undergo very bad treatment and that the conditions are terrible.\"\n\nAt a migrant camp in Matamoros, just across the river from Brownsville, a Honduran woman named Xiomara said she remembered meeting Ramirez and his daughter Valeria only hours before their deaths. She said she also met the toddlers mother, Avalos.\n\nXiomara said she wanted to use only her first name because she feared speaking out might hurt her family's asylum claim.\n\nHer family is on a list managed by Mexican officials, who coordinate with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Only a few migrants, if any, are allowed into the U.S. during any given week. A process referred to as metering. According to a report from the Office of the Inspector General, it likely convinces migrants to cross the river between ports of entry rather than endure the delay.\n\n\"They came here Saturday afternoon and asked me for information about the infamous list,\" explained Xiomara, \"and I told them they needed to return Monday morning. ... They told me they were surprised when I told them I've been here for more than two months.\"\n\nXiomara said the family asked her if she had ever thought about crossing the river. She told them no. She said Ramirez then told her they would return on Monday so that they could be added to the list.\n\nThe next day, two Peruvians who waited in line for more than three weeks informed her that Ramirez and Valeria had drowned.\n\n\"They told me they saw a woman crying when her child was drowning. They got here scared and told me a man and little girl drowned,\" Xiomara said. \"I never thought it would be Oscar or the little girl.\"\n\nThe Peruvian man, who did not want his name used because he feared speaking out might hurt his asylum claim, said he saw a group of people by the river. When he moved closer, he recognized Avalos, Ramirez's wife.\n\n\"She was crying uncontrollably saying they had come to the U.S. for help,\" the Peruvian man said.\n\nThe bodies of Ramirez and his daughter were found a day after they drowned, last Monday.\n\nXiomara said Valeria's smile was luminous and she thought Valeria's parents were a beautiful couple. Ramirez was 25, and Avalos is 21.\n\nShe shared her memories from her camp near the international bridge. As she spoke, children chased each other, a man slept on a thin foam mattress and others chatted and endured the summer heat.\n\nXiomara and her family are now number 3 on the metering list, but she estimated they would be in Mexico for at least another two weeks until they're finally allowed into the U.S. to be processed at a facility in the other side of the border. She said it hasn't been easy for her family because they have to spend their days under the hot sun, and they don't have water, showers or bathrooms.\n\nShe says that once she makes it across to the U.S., and if her asylum claim is successful, she'll head to the East Coast where she has family. She added that she will seek medical treatment for her daughter who suffers from a tumor and seizures.\n\nAnother woman at the camp sat under the roof of a building for shade. The woman came from Cuba with her husband and daughter. She said she is five months pregnant and has been waiting to be allowed into the U.S. for about 17 days. She said she didn't realize she'd have to wait for so long, admitting she has considered crossing the river.\n\n\"I was thinking about it before this incident occurred,\" she said \u2014 referring to Ramirez and Valeria \u2014 \"I haven't checked if everything is okay with my baby. Having a one-and-a-half year old kid also makes me very anxious because I don't see the line moving.\"\n\nAt Sunday's vigil, Zavala's rallying cry resounded among those in the crowd.\n\n\"And something else that helps me get through this, this tragedy that the deaths of Oscar and Valeria will not go in vain,\" said Zavala.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://6abc.com/travel/philadelphia-international-airport-unveils-runway-expansion/5696597/", "authors": [], "title": "Philadelphia International Airport unveils runway expansion", "text": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- A ribbon cutting Thursday morning at Philadelphia International Airport ushered in a new era for travel in the region.It's the latest in a massive multi-billion dollar plan to improve PHL.Runway 27L is now 12,000 feet in length.Airport officials say it accommodates larger planes that generally fly more international routes to land and take off from Philadelphia.The $200-million project took five years to complete and was fraught with controversy from the very beginning.Initially, the city planned to make way for the expansion by relocating hundreds of people living in 72 homes.But the homes, which are located in Tinicum Township, were later deemed safe thanks to an agreement between the township and Philadelphia city officialsAs a result of the new runway, American Airlines just announced direct service flights to Africa, with plans for Asia to be next.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.dailybulletin.com/nordstrom-closing-permanently-in-riverside-montclair", "authors": ["Kevin Smith", "Kevin Smith Handles Business News", "Editing For The Southern California News Group", "Which Includes Newspapers", "Websites", "Social Media Channels.

Oh sure, there have been stories of small samples of the 382 kg of moon rocks and dust that were returned at the cost of something like $25 billion making it into the hands of private collectors, and chunks of the moon may be the ultimate collector\u2019s item, but really, at the end of the day it\u2019s just rock and dust. The serious space junkie wants hardware \u2013 the actual pieces of human engineering that helped bring an epic adventure to fruition, and the closer to the moon the artifact got, the more desirable it is.\n\nSadly, of the 3,000,000 kg launch weight of a Saturn V rocket, only the 5,600 kg command module ever returned to Earth intact. The rest was left along the way, mostly either burned up in the atmosphere or left on the surface of the Moon. While some of these artifacts are recoverable \u2013 Jeff Bezos himself devoted a portion of his sizable fortune to salvage one of the 65 F1 engines that were deposited into the Atlantic ocean \u2013 those left on the Moon are, for now, unrecoverable, and in most cases they are twisted heaps of wreckage that was intentionally crashed into the lunar surface.\n\nBut at least one artifact escaped this ignominious fate, silently orbiting the sun for the last 50 years. This lonely outpost of the space program, the ascent stage from the Apollo 10 Lunar Module, appears to have been located by a team of amateur astronomers, and if indeed the spacecraft, dubbed \u201cSnoopy\u201d by its crew, is still out there, it raises the intriguing possibility of scoring the ultimate Apollo artifact by recovering it and bringing it back home.\n\nThe Expendables\n\nFor as well engineered as the entire Apollo program was, it made some serious compromises to get to the Moon within the time allotted by President Kennedy\u2019s 1961 throwdown speech. With an essentially bottomless pit of money available, it was far quicker to design Apollo as a series of disposable modules rather than returnable, reusable spacecraft. Therefore, everything about Apollo traded money for speed of development, with everything built to do exactly one job, to do it well, and then, for the most part, go away.\n\nThis design philosophy was clear from the arrangement of the Lunar Module, or LM. Deployed from storage underneath the Command-Service Module (CSM) and docked to it, the ungainly assembly made the translunar voyage, whereupon the LM descended to the surface, braked and maneuvered by the engine in the lower descent stage. When it was time to go home, the two astronauts launched the upper ascent stage back into lunar orbit, docked with the CSM, and jettisoned the now useless ascent stage, which would orbit the Moon for a bit before crashing into it.\n\nThat was the script for all the manned landings. But Apollo 10, the dress rehearsal for the eventual landing of Apollo 11, was different. Its mission was to further characterize lunar gravitation so that the guidance systems could be tightly calibrated for Apollo 11, as well as to give the entire ground control team a chance to practice for the big show. To that end, astronauts Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan descended in the LM \u201cSnoopy\u201d to within 14 km of the lunar surface, tantalizingly close and yet so far before jettisoning the lower descent stage and returning to the Command Module \u201cCharlie Brown\u201d, piloted by John Young, for the ride home.\n\nGoing Off Script\n\nRather than becoming twisted wreckage on the surface like the descent stage, the remaining fuel in Snoopy\u2019s ascent stage was used to blast it out of lunar orbit. It\u2019s not clear why this was done from any of the available mission documents, but we can make a few guesses. First, missions from Apollo 11 onward left seismometers on the lunar surface, and having something massive crash into the surface at a known time and location was a perfect way to validate the instruments. Since Cernan and Stafford never touched down in Snoopy, they never placed those instruments, so crashing the machine into the Moon was pointless.\n\nFurthermore, Snoopy came back to rendezvous with Charlie Brown with much more propellant on board than an ascent stage that had actually reached the surface would. Perhaps mission planners were worried about contaminating potential future landing sites with the hypergolic witch\u2019s brew Snoopy carried in its tanks. Whatever the reason, Snoopy was put into a heliocentric orbit which NASA tracked for a while, but only until it was clear that it was no longer a threat to the astronauts as they returned home. Snoopy\u2019s long, lonely time in space had begun.\n\nPractically Priceless\n\nSnoopy remained lost for most of the next 50 years. But astronomers love a challenge, and the thought of finding a 4-meter wide piece of history after half a century proved irresistible. Nick Howes, an amateur astronomer and fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, set out to find Snoopy. He and a team of astronomers, using telescopes in Hawaii, Australia, and Arizona, along with a few terabytes of radar data, began the search in 2011.\n\nWorking backward from the May 1969 start of Snoopy\u2019s long journey, they found enough clues in the data to make a list of a number of near-Earth objects with the potential to be Snoopy. But we have made quite a mess up there. Added to the pile of natural objects in near-Earth orbit, narrowing down that list took some doing. One such object, WT1190F, was initially thought to be Snoopy, but it was determined to be the Star 37 rocket motor used for translunar injection of the Lunar Prospector mission in 1998. The orbit of WT1190F eventually crossed Earth\u2019s orbit in 2015, and it ended up burning up over the Indian Ocean.\n\nOne object stood out from the data, though. Dubbed 2018AV2, the object has an orbital period of 382 days, making it only slightly slower than Earth and currently following it. It\u2019s pretty much on the same orbital plane as Earth, too, a good indication that it\u2019s an artificial object. Its apparent brightness corresponds to what one would expect from a lunar ascent module, so all signs point to it being Snoopy. However, the object is currently over a third of an astronomical unit, or 55,000,000 km, away from Earth \u2013 too far to be 100% sure. More observations, like small perturbations in its orbit that wouldn\u2019t happen for natural objects, or spectrographic analysis to see if its paint matches NASA records, are needed to make sure it\u2019s Snoopy.\n\nThe next time AV2 gets close to Earth is in July 2037, almost 68 years since Snoopy was abandoned in space. It will only be 6,400,000 km away, close enough to possibly mount a recovery mission. That gives us 18 years to tighten up the data, possibly by sending a small satellite to intercept it and perhaps snap a picture. If it is Snoopy, it\u2019s a one-of-a-kind artifact and it may just be feasible to send a salvage mission to retrieve it. It would be hideously expensive, but something like that is practically priceless in terms of historical value, and it may well prove as irresistible to some future treasure hunter as it did to Nick Howes and the others to locate it in the first place.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cleveland19.com/2020/03/13/year-old-girl-others-die-flu-related-illness-cuyahoga-county/", "authors": ["John Deike", "Published At Pm", "Published At Am", "Published March", "At Pm"], "title": "11-year-old girl and 3 others die from flu-related illnesses in Cuyahoga County", "text": "Ohio Gov.

The International Atomic Energy Agency says that \u201cstructured program\u201d ended in 2003. U.S. intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.\n\nIsrael insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran\u2019s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.\n\nShamkhani\u2019s remarks drastically change the story of Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing, which took place Friday. Authorities initially said a truck exploded and then gunmen opened fire on the scientist, killing him and a bodyguard. State TV even interviewed a man the night of the attack who described seeing gunmen open fire.\n\nState TV\u2019s English-language broadcaster Press TV reported earlier Monday that a weapon recovered from the scene of the attack bore \u201cthe logo and specifications of the Israeli military industry.\u201d State TV\u2019s Arabic-language channel, Al-Alam, claimed the weapons used were \u201ccontrolled by satellite,\u201d a claim also made Sunday by the semiofficial Fars news agency.\n\nNone of the outlets immediately offered evidence supporting their claims, which also give authorities a way to explain why no one was reportedly arrested at the scene.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the operation was a very complicated operation and was carried out by using electronic devices,\u201d Shamkhani told state TV. \u201cNo individual was present at the site.\u201d\n\nSatellite control of weapons is nothing new. Armed, long-range drones, for instance, rely on satellite connections to be controlled by their remote pilots. Remote-controlled gun turrets also exist, but typically see their operator connected by a hard line to cut down on the delay in commands being relayed. Israel uses such hard-wired systems along the border with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.\n\nWhile technically feasible, it wasn\u2019t immediately clear if such a system had been used before, said Jeremy Binnie, the Mideast editor of Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly.\n\n\u201cCould you set up a weapon with a camera which then has a feed that uses an open satellite communications line back to the controller?\u201d Binnie said. \u201cI can\u2019t see why that\u2019s not possible.\u201d\n\nIt also raised the question whether the truck that exploded during the attack detonated afterward to try to destroy a satellite-controlled machine gun that was hidden inside the vehicle. Iranian officials did not immediately acknowledge that. It also would require someone on the ground to set up the weapon.\n\nShamkhani blamed the Iranian exile group Mujahedeen-e-Khalq as well for \u201chaving a role in this,\u201d without elaborating. The MEK, as the exile group is known, has been suspected of assisting Israeli operations in Iran in the past. Shahin Gobadi, an MEK spokesman, dismissed Shamkhani\u2019s remarks as \u201crage, rancor and lies\u201d sparked by the group\u2019s earlier exposes over Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nFull Coverage: Iran\n\nMonday\u2019s service for Fakhrizadeh took place at an outdoor portion of Iran\u2019s Defense Ministry in Tehran, with officials including Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami, the Guard\u2019s Quds Force leader Gen. Esmail Ghaani, civilian nuclear program chief Ali Akbar Sahei and Intelligence Minister Mamoud Alavi. They sat apart from each other and wore masks due to the coronavirus pandemic as reciters melodically read parts of the Quran and religious texts.\n\nDefense Minister Gen. Amir Hatami gave a speech after kissing Fakhrizadeh\u2019s casket and putting his forehead against it. He said Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing would make Iranians \u201cmore united, more determined.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the continuation of your path, we will continue with more speed and more power,\u201d Hatami said in comments aired live by state television.\n\nHatami also criticized countries that hadn\u2019t condemned Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing and warned: \u201cThis will catch up with you someday.\u201d\n\nOvernight, the United Arab Emirates, which just reached a normalization deal with Israel, issued a statement condemning \u201cthe heinous assassination.\u201d The UAE, home to Abu Dhabi and Dubai, warned the killing \u201ccould further fuel conflict in the region.\u201d\n\nLast year, the UAE found itself in the middle of an escalating series of incidents between Iran and the U.S. Though long suspicious of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, the Emirates has said it wants to de-escalate the crisis. The UAE just started passenger air service to Israel and Israelis are expected to vacation in the country over Hanukkah in the coming days.\n\nBahrain, an island kingdom off Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf that also recently normalized relations with Israel, similarly condemned Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing.\n\n\u201cIn light of the current situation in the region, the kingdom of Bahrain calls on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid new levels of instability,\u201d Bahrain\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli Foreign Ministry Director-General Alon Ushpiz has sent a cable to all Israeli diplomatic delegations around the globe urging diplomats to maintain \u201cthe highest level of readiness and awareness of any irregular activity\u201d around missions and Jewish community centers.\n\nHebrew-language media in Israel reported that following the Fakhrizadeh\u2019s killing, the Foreign Ministry ordered security increased at certain Israeli diplomatic missions overseas. The ministry declined to comment on diplomatic security matters.\n\n___\n\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

Why Its Stock Is Rising Anyway.", "text": "Text size\n\nAurora Cannabis reported a net loss of about 1.3 billion Canadian dollars (US$980 million) for its fiscal second quarter, but shares were rising near midday Thursday.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean things are going great. Shares are still down about 26% from a week ago, right before Aurora said CEO Terry Booth was out. The company had announced preliminary results, which meant Thursday\u2019s earnings report was somewhat priced in.\n\nFor the second quarter of its 2020 fiscal year, ended in December, Aurora reported a net loss of 89 cents a share, larger than the 6 cents a share Wall Street had anticipated, according to Bloomberg. More than C$1 billion of its net loss was related to write-downs, including C$762 million in goodwill impairments.\n\nAurora\u2019s net revenue of 56 million Canadian dollars (US$ 42 million) was down 25% from the first quarter. Consensus estimates called for C$59 million. Net cannabis revenue was C$52.6 million, which was near the midpoint of the range Aurora announced last week.\n\nRecreational pot revenue fell to C$22.9 million. That includes return provisions of C$10.6 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization was a loss of C$80.2 million.\n\nStifel analyst Andrew Carter, who has a Sell rating on the stock, took a neutral view of the report, given the context. He wrote that the results echoed the sentiment from last week\u2019s announcement, given the Ebitda loss and C$260 million in cash burned during the quarter. Aurora said last week it renegotiated covenants with its lenders. The new terms mean the company will need to turn cash-flow positive in the quarter ending in September, with C$50 million in Ebitda in fiscal year 2021.\n\nAurora stock was up 2.4% to $1.50, rallying from a $1.43 open, which touched a one-year intraday low. The S&P 500 index was flat Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cEven with the precipitous decline in Aurora shares, we highlight an enterprise value of C$2.8 billion with the constraints on Aurora suggesting difficulty for Aurora to improve its position and keep pace in the quickly evolving Canadian category which we estimate to be a C$5 billion wholesale opportunity for producers,\u201d Carter said.\n\nWrite to Connor Smith at connor.smith@barrons.com", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-investigation-idUSKBN23519M", "authors": ["Carlos Barria", "Min Read"], "title": "Racially charged violence rages for third night in Minneapolis", "text": "MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - A third night of racially charged arson, looting and vandalism gripped Minneapolis as protesters vented rage over the death of an unarmed black man after a white police officer knelt on his neck as he lay on the ground following arrest.\n\nThe latest unrest in Minnesota\u2019s largest city went largely unchecked late Thursday, with the mayor ordering a tactical police retreat from a police station that was set ablaze.\n\nNational Guard troops called out earlier in the day by the governor kept a low profile. Governor Tim Walz had ordered the Guard to help keep the peace after two previous nights of disturbances sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death on Monday.\n\nIn a late-night Twitter message, President Donald Trump said he would send in National Guard troops to \u201cget the job done right\u201d if the \u201cweak\u201d mayor failed to restore order, suggesting lethal force might be needed.\n\n\u201cAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d Trump wrote.\n\nThe arrest of Floyd, 46, was captured by an onlooker\u2019s cell phone video that went viral and showed a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd\u2019s neck as he moaned: \u201cPlease, I can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nFour police officers involved in the arrest of Floyd, who was accused of trying to pass counterfeit money at a corner store, were dismissed on Tuesday, but unrest has continued unabated.\n\nSympathy protests erupted on Wednesday in Los Angeles and Thursday in Denver, with freeway traffic blocked in both cities. In Phoenix, protesters faced off with police in riot gear at City Hall, and a rally was held at the Arizona state Capitol.\n\nThursday night\u2019s disturbances in Minneapolis also spread into adjacent city of St. Paul, the state capital, with fires and vandalism breaking out there.\n\nIn contrast with Wednesday night, when rock-throwing demonstrators clashed with police in riot gear, law enforcement in Minneapolis kept mostly out of sight around the epicenter of Thursday\u2019s disturbances, the Third Precinct police station.\n\nProtesters massing outside the building briefly retreated under volleys of police tear gas and rubber bullets fired at them from the roof, only to regroup and eventually attack the building, setting fire to the structure as police withdrew.\n\nNational Guard troops were absent, as were members of the fire department. Protesters were later observed on the roof, and a crowd of hundreds lingered around the building for hours, feeding flames with hunks of plywood and other debris.\n\nPlumes of smoke rise into the sky in the aftermath of a protest after a white police officer was caught on a bystander's video pressing his knee into the neck of African-American man George Floyd, who later died at a hospital, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., May 29, 2020.

Weakness is pointing your own finger at a time of crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard said it activated 500 of its soldiers in the greater Minneapolis area, mostly to provide security support to firefighters.\n\nThe mayor said many of the troops had been posted around the city to help police prevent looting of banks, grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential locations during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSeveral other buildings and a car were set ablaze and looters plundered several businesses, including a burning liquor store and nearby discount store that had been ransacked the night before. Fire officials said 16 buildings were torched on Wednesday night.\n\nThe upheaval followed concerted efforts by law enforcement officials to ease tensions by promising justice for Floyd.\n\nThe Floyd case was reminiscent of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City who died after being put in a banned police chokehold as he, too, was heard to mutter, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d\n\nGarner\u2019s dying words became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that formed amid a wave of killings of African-Americans by police.\n\nAt a peaceful daytime rally and march on Thursday around a county government center in Minneapolis, protesters pressed their demands for the four policemen to be arrested and charged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for a favor. We\u2019re asking for what is right,\u201d civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said as he addressed the crowd.\n\nPolice Chief Medaria Arradondo publicly apologized to Floyd\u2019s family on Thursday morning, conceding his department had contributed to a \u201cdeficit of hope\u201d in Minneapolis.\n\nOfficials overseeing investigations from the U.S. Justice Department, FBI, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and prosecutors appealed for calm, vowing a thorough investigation.\n\nSlideshow (21 Images)\n\nFloyd was a Houston native who had worked as a nightclub security guard.

She constantly calls when I am on the air, not able to (or at least refusing to) remember my schedule. In fairness to her, she has a lot going on among all five of our kids, and my schedule is a little all over the place. But still she calls. On air, on set, in a meeting, she calls me all day, every day.\n\nMy wife doesn't keep anything in. If she thinks it, she expresses it. She will wake me up in the middle of the night on a Tuesday to ask what I want for dinner on Friday because she suddenly thought of it. It's annoying and adorable and it's just how she is.\n\nBut I always answer when she calls, wherever I am, whatever I am doing, because you never know if it's an emergency.\n\nIt never is.\n\nUntil last Monday, when it was.\n\nMy wife was in New Orleans for the weekend, as our second-oldest goes to Tulane and it was parents weekend. And I'm on set of The Fantasy Show, doing our Week 9 recaps. And my phone rings. Now, it's on silent, and during the show we are often all over the studio, doing sketches, interacting with puppets, lots going on. But the phone is usually near me. And in between segments, I notice she's calling.\n\n\"Hey, I'm on set. Is everything OK?\"\n\n\"No! There's an emergency at school. I need you to get there I'm trying to get an earlier flight out butIjustspoketothenurse ...\" She's talking a million miles a minute when suddenly the other line rings. It's my daughters' school. I have twin daughters who are in second grade, and, obviously, they attend the same school. \"Beth, it's the school. Let me call you right back.\"\n\nI am standing on set. I have a microphone on, I'm surrounded by four cameras and I hear Javi the director in my ear. Daniel Dopp, producers, crew members and a guy in a bear costume are staring at me as I answer the phone.\n\n\"Mr. Berry, it's Kate, the school nurse, and we have an emergency.\"\n\nAnd my heart stops in a way it never has before.\n\nThese days, an emergency at school can mean many things, and none of them good.\n\nAnd I'm helpless to do anything, 30 minutes away, wearing makeup as a dozen people patiently wait for me so they can get back to doing their jobs.\n\nAs Kate the Nurse starts to tell me what's going on, I hear a familiar sound. My daughter screaming and crying in the background. She is in pain like I have never heard before, yelling for me and her mom, but, morbid as it is to admit this, I'm relieved to hear those sounds. My first thought is, \"OK, whatever it is, at least she's alive.\"\n\nKate explains that my daughter fell off the monkey bars at school and she has broken her arm in multiple places. They have called an ambulance. I tell them I know my daughter and that in addition to being in pain, I am sure she is scared. Who is going to ride in the ambulance with her? They tell me they're trying to find someone. I am adamant that someone she knows rides with her.\n\nThe school offers to have me come to the school and pick her up or ride with her, but I am about a half-hour away from the school. Finally, they tell me her teacher, bless her, will ride with her. My daughter loves her teacher, so, \"Great,\" I say. Please get her in the ambulance and to the emergency room as soon as possible. I'll meet them at the hospital.\n\nI look around at my co-workers, who are all staring at me and have heard only half of this conversation -- the parts about an ambulance and the emergency room. But I have no time to explain because my wife is on the other line. Our 15-year-old, who is a freshman in high school, was on the other line with Beth. He was very worried. He can't drive yet, and like many teenage boys, is often annoyed with his little sisters, but none of that matters now. He wanted to leave his school and take a ride-sharing service to his sisters' school, or have the ambulance come pick him up so he could ride with her. I was really touched by that. Very sweet.\n\nBut there is no time. I told them she was in a lot of pain and it was most important to get her help quickly. So I finally hang up and look at the crew. \"She fell off the monkey bars at school and broke her arm. They say it looks really bad. I'm sorry, but I have to leave right now.\" My producers don't hesitate. \"Go. Don't worry. We will figure something out.\" I turn to Daniel. \"Will you host?\" Daniel says of course, whatever is needed. I thank them all and run out of the taping. And that's why, if you watched last week's Monday and Tuesday episodes of The Fantasy Show, you saw a lot of Daniel and no sign of me.\n\nDriving to the emergency room at Yale New Haven Children's Hospital, I quickly talk again to my wife, who is now heading to the airport to try to get on the first flight she can back. She'll do her best, but getting from New Orleans to Hartford, Connecticut, is not easy and certainly not direct. She hangs up to call the airline as I'm left with a new realization.\n\nI'm on my own here. Even if she can get an earlier flight she's out of pocket for many hours. I'm going to have to make all the decisions. Beth and I generally decide things about the kids together, but as anyone who knows both of us will tell you, I'm an idiot. Certainly compared to her. I feel naked and nervous and completely unprepared to handle the first major emergency with one of my kids, by myself.\n\nI can't dwell on that because I'm now at the ER, and as hospital staff are bringing me back to my daughter's room, I hear her screaming all the way down the hall. She is in incredible pain, and as I get into the room, I quickly understand why.\n\nBoth of her arms are broken.\n\nHer forearms are bent in ways that they shouldn't be.\n\nShe looks at me, eyes wide, tears in them but trying to force a brave smile. \"Daddy, I want to hug you but my arms are broken.\"\n\nAnd my heart just snaps in two.\n\nSome days are better than others. Courtesy of Berry Family\n\nToo many doctors and nurses to count are all around, sticking and poking and hooking her up to everything under the sun and getting her some pain medication while I speak to her teacher about exactly what happened at school, and a doctor who explains that each of your forearms has two bones. The radius and the ulna. And my daughter has broken both of them.\n\nIn each arm.\n\nShe's likely going to need surgery, that night. They'll know more after the orthopedic surgeon looks at her X-rays. OK, I say, pulling the doctor away quietly. I get that this is bad and fairly rare to break both arms, especially all four bones. But she'll eventually be OK, right? No long-term damage?\n\nToo soon to tell, he says.\n\nToo soon to tell.\n\nAnd I just sit there with that.\n\nMy thoughts are interrupted by her teacher and the school's principal, who had also come in the ambulance with my daughter. Making sure there was nothing else we needed, they were heading back to school. I thank them both profusely as I turn back to my daughter. The meds had kicked in by this point, so while still very uncomfortable, she is no longer in immense pain.\n\nThe doctors and nurses leave, telling us they will come grab us when it's time for X-rays. And then a room that was full of insane commotion just 30 seconds earlier is now still and quiet. Just me, my daughter and her bent arms, lying listlessly on the bed.\n\nAnd I don't know how to make this better. That's Daddy's job, right? \"Everything's going to be all right, Daddy's here, I'll fix this, I'll take care of it, don't worry. Daddy's here.\" That's the job and I say all of these things and more. But inside I have no idea how to make this better, how to fix this. I feel as helpless as I ever have.\n\nShe's the rule-follower of my twins, and she keeps apologizing. I keep assuring her that this isn't her fault, it's an accident and that Mommy and Daddy aren't mad. That now we are in the hospital and they have doctors here and everything is going to be all right, even if I don't fully trust that myself.\n\nI don't know what to do, but whatever it is, I decide, we are going to do it together. It's a busy day (and eventually night) at the ER, so I am told to get comfortable. We are going to be here a while. We decide to watch \"Frozen,\" her favorite movie. It's been a while since we've watched it, but it's familiar and comforting, and right now, I'm for all the comfort she can get.\n\nWe watch the movie together, me sitting as close as I can to her bed as she holds my hand with two little fingers, the only parts of her arm that can move at the moment. And as the movie starts, she looks at me. \"I'm glad you're here, Daddy.\"\n\n\"I am too, love bug. I am too.\"\n\nAfter the movie, the X-rays, more tests, doctors and pain meds, she is hungry (they won't let her eat) but feeling calmer. We talk about it, and I ask if she's up for seeing some folks, because my phone has been blowing up with concerned family, friends and co-workers. She video chats with her mom (now in a layover in Charlotte, North Carolina), her aunt, grandmother, brothers and a few friends at school. Her best friend's mom texts and asks if she can bring my daughter's friend by to visit. This sparks a smile and a \"please, please, please\" from my daughter, so with the blessing of the doctor, I say come on down. She comes with gifts, and I see the smile I love finally start to peek out.\n\nThe orthopedist comes in. They need to put her under and get to work. And it goes ... well. Thank goodness. More tests, more X-rays, but the orthopedic surgeon tells me my daughter did great, and the doctor expects a full recovery, with no long-term, lasting effects. I sign all the discharge papers, my daughter finally gets to eat something and chooses a multicolored ice pop. We leave the ER almost 12 hours after I got there, a little after 2 a.m.\n\nMatthew Berry's RotoPass Need help with customized ranks for your scoring system, lineup setting tools, season-long projections and in-season trades? You need the Ultimate Fantasy Football resource. With RotoPass you get access to several leading fantasy football sites for one low price. You're welcome. -- Matthew Berry\n\nAnd now, we are adjusting to this temporary yet life-altering new reality. She has a full cast on each arm from wrist to shoulder. She can't use her arms at all. She can't feed herself, go to the bathroom or even scratch her nose. She needs someone to do all of that for her. She needs pain medication every three hours, so we are waking up in the middle of the night to give to her medicine. It's why I was mostly absent last week, including from this column. Thank you to my editors and to Field, Tristan and Matt for filling in last week.\n\nWe've met with the school about accommodations -- my daughter is getting some home help, and the hope is that she can return to school on a partial basis with an aide in a few weeks. Poor thing weighs like 45 pounds soaking wet, so her arms feel like they weigh more than she does, so she might need a wheelchair at school as well. Lots of adjustments for her and for us. It's going to be a long road back.\n\nBut here's the thing. Beth and I feel incredibly lucky.\n\nShe fell almost 7 feet off a jungle gym. She could have landed on her head, neck ... things could have been much, much worse than four broken bones. As I walked the hall of the children's ER that night, I saw much worse than what my daughter was going through, and I know that happens every day, to way too many children. Way too many kids, all over the world, suffer significantly more than my daughter currently does.\n\nThere are a lot of clich\u00e9s in this lesson -- taking time to smell the roses and not taking things for granted and how you never know when life will change. But clich\u00e9s are clich\u00e9s because they are universally true and repeated until all the originality has been squeezed out of them.\n\nI will tell you that, that Monday morning, I was annoyed at how some of my fantasy teams had performed the day before, and about an issue at work that continues to bug the hell out of me, and it had been a long few days of just me and the kids with Beth in New Orleans. And the minute I got that call, I forgot all about all of it. None of it really matters. And all my worries about handling all this by myself? Gone.\n\nAnd this is the part where I usually try to tie my intro to fantasy football, and sometimes it's more of a stretch than others. But I just don't see one this time, and to be honest, I shared this with you all because writing is cathartic, it helps me deal with things, and to put them in perspective. Like, not sweating the small stuff. You know. Small stuff like the fact this story has nothing to do with fantasy football. Do you care? Because I don't. Let's get to it.\n\nFor those joining us in progress ... this is not a start/sit column, but merely about whom I think will exceed or fall short of projections. Always check my ranks Sunday morning for the most up-to-date thoughts on where players stack up. Programming note: this week, Fantasy Football Now will be on ESPN2 from 10 a.m. ET to 11:30 and then will switch to ESPNEWS from 11:30 to 1 p.m. Thanks as always to \"Thirsty\" Kyle Soppe of the Fantasy Focus 06010 podcast and The Stat-a-Pillar Damian Dabrowski of The Fantasy Show for their help at various points in this column. Unless otherwise noted, all stats are for the past four weeks (Weeks 7-10). Here we go.\n\nQuarterbacks I Love in Week 11\n\nAs frustrating as \"Bad Jameis\" has been, \"Good Jameis\" is capable of winning you a week almost by himself. Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJameis Winston, Bucs (vs. Saints): Quietly averaging 348.5 passing yards over his past four games, we should get \"Good Jameis\" this week in a potential shootout against a Saints secondary that is likely without standout corner Marshon Lattimore (hamstring). Given the success teams have throwing the ball against Tampa Bay (Bucs are 28th against the pass), the Saints will put up points, and I expect Winston to keep the Bucs in it with his arm in a game Caesar's has as the third-highest over/under on the board this week.\n\nTom Brady, Patriots (at Eagles): He's had over 255 passing yards the week following a bye in each of the past six seasons, and comes off his rest week having had more time to practice with Mohamed Sanu to face an Eagles defense that has given up at 17 points to opposing quarterbacks in six different games this year. With two weeks to prepare for the NFL's eighth-worst red zone defense, I like Brady's chances at a top-7 finish this week.\n\nJosh Allen, Bills (at Dolphins): With at least 21 fantasy points in all three career games against the Fins, Allen should continue his hot streak against a hard-playing but still under-manned Miami defense that is bottom five in the NFL in yards per pass attempt, touchdown percentage allowed, pressure rate and more. With three rushing scores in his past two games, there's a good floor here for Allen and a pretty high ceiling as well.\n\nOthers receiving votes: Philip Rivers is coming off a \"mini-bye\" after the Chargers having played Week 10's Thursday game and being featured in Week 11's Mexico City Monday Night Football game, so that helps mitigate a bit of the travel concerns. Rivers averaged 23.7 points per game against the Chiefs last year and should have to throw to keep up with Patrick Mahomes. K.C. has allowed over 17.5 points seven different times this season (and over 21 points five times). ... The week's obvious top streaming option is Derek Carr against a Cincy team that has allowed each of the past five quarterbacks it has faced to score at least 21 fantasy points, and coughs up a league-high 7.2 yards per catch after the reception. ... Two first names, always a crowd pleaser. As is a matchup with the Falcons' porous defense (last week notwithstanding). All of which means Kyle Allen is a very \"QB2 with upside\" this week against an Atlanta team that has allowed at least two touchdown passes in six of its past seven games and that hasn't had an interception since Week 2.\n\nQuarterbacks I Hate in Week 11\n\nCarson Wentz, Eagles (vs. Patriots): Been a tough year for Carson Wentz. The eighth QB off the board in most ESPN drafts this year, Wentz has yet to finish better than QB8 a single time this season and has more finishes outside the top 15 at the position than he does in the top 10. Lamar Jackson, who has a decidedly different skill set, is the only QB to score more than 12 fantasy points against the Patriots. Vegas projects 20-22 points for Philly this week, and for his career, Wentz averages just 14.99 FPPG when the Eagles are held under 25 points.\n\nKyler Murray, Cardinals (at 49ers): Yes, he had a nice game two weeks ago against these same 49ers. But don't forget that 55.7% of his points in that game came on one completion (the 88-yard TD to Andy Isabella). Yes, all completions count, but we are in the business of preparing for what is most likely to happen, and banking on an 88-yard score from a player who had eight receiving yards on the season prior seems ... optimistic. With five different games this year without a single TD pass, Murray is merely a boom/bust option on the road against one of the best defenses in the NFL.\n\nSam Darnold, Jets (at Redskins): I get it, I swear. Dude put up 21.7 FP last week and now he gets the Deadskins. But look closer. As the sixth-best passing defense, Washington allows the 7th lowest deep completion percentage this year. It's partially because it is so easy to run on the Skins, and teams are rarely down to them, so you just don't need to pass on Washington. With one of the lowest under/overs on the slate featuring two of the slowest offenses in the league, there are better Week 11 streamers.\n\nRunning Backs I Love in Week 11:\n\nAntonio Brown's short tenure with the Raiders tempered some of the draft-day hype that fell Josh Jacob's way, but Jacobs has been as advertised and become the focal point of the Raiders offense. Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nJosh Jacobs, Raiders (vs, Bengals): A popular fade for many during draft season, my 2019 preseason Fantasy Ride or Die has been much more ride than die these days, with five rushing scores in his past five games. Vaulting into the top 10 of fantasy running backs in total points, Jacobs has six straight games with 17+ touches. And I expect the heavy workload to continue as a double-digit home favorite against a Cincy squad allowing a league-high 173 rush yards per game this season. He's a top three play for me this week.\n\nMelvin Gordon, Chargers (vs. Chiefs in Mexico City): Ohhh, that's right. That's what Melvin Gordon looks like. We said all along in the preseason we didn't expect Melvin Gordon back until Week 10 and, while we got the reporting date wildly wrong, we were right on in terms of him being the guy the you drafted. With 23 touches in each of the last two games, expect a heavy dose of him as the Bolts try to slow down K.C. Five teams this season have seen their running backs rush for at least 150 yards versus the Chiefs as KC allows the third most yards per carry (5.14) and is bottom-6 in terms of both yards before and after first contact.\n\nLe'Veon Bell, Jets (at Redskins): As hinted at in the Sam Darnold section, the way to beat Washington is exploiting a run defense (I use the term \"defense\" loosely here) that allows the fifth most rush yards per game (136) and the seventh most RB PPG (27.5). Well, to be fair, there are many ways to beat Washington, but the run seems to be a popular one. Only Christian McCaffrey has a higher percentage of his team's touches than Bell, so a heavy workload is coming against a squad that also allows a 78.8% completion rate on passes shorter than 15 yards.\n\nOthers receiving votes: Since Week 8, Devin Singletary has out-snapped Gore 122-57 and is averaging 6.4 YPC this season. A true three-down back (16 targets in his past three games) the only concern is that they seem to use Gore (and QB Josh Allen) at the goal line more than you'd like. And there's always a chance they give Gore a chance to run one in against his former team. Still, Singletary is good enough to be a very viable RB2 against Miami. ... Eleven different RBs have scored 10+ points vs. Carolina this season as the Panthers have allowed a league-high 17 rushing TDs (five more than the next closest team). And with Devonta Freeman unlikely to play, this sets up as a week to flex Brian Hill in a game with an over/under of 49.5. ... Always dangerous picking a Patriots running back, but this smells like a James White game to me against an Eagles defense that creates pressure at the fifth-highest rate. Expect lots of dump-offs to White, who quietly trails on Austin Ekeler and Christian McCaffrey in running back receptions. ... Speaking of PPR flex types, my \"bold prediction\" last week on Fantasy Football Now was that J.D. McKissic would finish as a top 20 RB in PPR. He finished as RB 19. With Ty Johnson still banged up as of this writing, you could do worse than McKissic as a desperation flex this week against a Cowboys team that has allowed the third most RB receptions per game this season.\n\nRunning Backs I Hate in Week 11\n\nGet the best of ESPN sent to your inbox The ESPN Daily delivers the biggest sports news and moments every weekday. Sign me up! Email:\n\nTodd Gurley II, Rams (vs. Bears): Free Todd Gurley? Gurley has not caught a pass in consecutive games and has failed to catch multiple passes in five of his eight games this season. He has yet to have more than 18 carries in a game this season, and 45% of his points this season have come on plays in which he has scored, making him a (checks notes) touchdown-dependent RB2. Um, yeah. Free Todd Gurley! Sadly I don't think it happens this week against a Bears team that is fourth in yards-per-carry-against. Add to that a struggling offensive line that just lost its starting center for the year and will be without their right tackle this week. You likely don't have better options but to play him, but I'm not optimistic about a big game unless he falls into the end zone.\n\nDavid Montgomery, Bears (at Rams): Other side of the ball in that same game, Rams are the No. 1 run defense in the NFL over the past four weeks and are second-best in yards-per-carry-against. Montgomery is another guy who is touchdown-dependent for fantasy value as, if you remove a fluky 55-yard-run against the Chargers in Week 8, he is averaging 3.21 yards on his other 128 carries this season.\n\nRonald Jones II, Bucs (vs. Saints): Since Week 4, the Saints have allowed 3.5 yards per carry (third best) and 69 rush yards per game (fewest in the NFL). They are the third-best run defense in the NFL over the past four weeks and hey, I know Bruce Arians said he wasn't going to hold Jones' fumble against him this week, which is promising, but still, it's a tough matchup. Jones' floor is helped if he continues his passing-down work, but we saw that in only one game and that game was against Arizona. Hard to declare it's definitely a thing now, and if he doesn't get the passing-down work, this is a tough sell as anything other than a cross-your-fingers flex this week.\n\nPhillip Lindsay and Royce Freeman, Broncos (at Vikings): The only teams that have rushed for even 110 yards vs. Minnesota this season had an elite QB or deep threats to keep the Vikes defense downfield (Packers and Chiefs, in a game where Patrick Mahomes was injured but Tyreek Hill had returned). Can't imagine Brandon Allen coming into Minnesota and moving the ball at all in this one, and falling behind quickly does not help this split job on a team that is unlikely to have a lot of possessions and isn't likely to be in scoring position often. As double-digit underdogs on the road in a game with an over/under of 40, they are merely desperation flex plays at best.\n\nPass Catchers I Love in Week 11\n\nKeenan Allen may not owe us anything, but perhaps Lady Luck owes Keenan Allen some good fortune the rest of this season. Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images\n\nKeenan Allen, Chargers (vs. Chiefs in Mexico City): How bad has it been for Allen? Been so brutal I can put him on the \"love\" list and it doesn't seem obvious, as he is just WR56 since Week 4, behind guys like Danny Amendola and Randall Cobb. Brutal, but this is his week in a shootout against a Chiefs team than allows the 10th-highest completion percentage, the fifth-highest touchdown percentage and third-highest passer rating, all to the slot this year.\n\nDJ Moore, Panthers (vs. Falcons): With double-digit targets in two straight and in three of the past four, and at least eight targets in five straight, Moore should stay busy on Sunday against a Falcons team that is bottom three in the NFL in yards per completion, catch rate allowed, touchdown rate and passer rating allowed. Over 15 fantasy points in four of his past five games, I have Moore as a top-12 play this week.\n\nMichael Gallup, Cowboys (at Lions): With Darius Slay expected to shadow Amari Cooper, I expect Dak to take at least a few deep shots to Gallup here as he's had multiple deep targets in four of his past five games. That's significant because since Week 5, the Lions have coughed up the second-highest deep completion percentage and the highest deep-touchdown pass percentage in the league. Gallup's 102.1 air yards per game (12th most in the NFL) are not a fluke and against the Lions' bottom-2 pass defense, I expect him to get looks early and often. I have Gallup as a top-20 play this week and like his chances to get into the end zone for the third straight game.\n\nJamison Crowder, Jets (at Redskins): Revenge game! Or... just another really good matchup for a slot receiver against a Washington squad that allows a league-high 78.9 completion percentage to slot receivers and gives up touchdowns to the slot at the ninth-highest rate. Crowder has scored in two straight with a strong chance to make it three in a row on Sunday in front of a bunch of Jets fans at FedEx field.\n\nDarren Waller, Raiders (vs. Bengals): Been a tough few weeks for Waller the Baller, but that turns around this Sunday at the Black Hole. Cincy has been pummeled for a league-high 7.2 yards per catch after the reception this season and they allow opponents to complete 73.1% of their TE targets. Still getting a 24% target share (fourth highest at the position), Waller the Baller gets back on track this week against the NFL's 32nd-ranked scoring defense the past four weeks.\n\nOthers receiving votes: For all that has gone wrong this year for the Jets, they have a great run defense. Which is why teams try to exploit their bottom-10 pass defense. Definite risk here, especially with unproven rookie Dwayne Haskins under center, but I like Terry McScorin's chances (Come on, that's better than F1 for a nickname) to get into the end zone, or at least have a top 30-ish day. ... The Texans cough up over 295 passing yards per game on the season (fourth most) and there's not a QB in the NFL hotter than Lamar Jackson. Gimme some Marquise Brown on Sunday. ... Don't look now, but since the Bills' bye week, Cole Beasley is the 29th best WR in fantasy. You could do a lot worse for a WR3 this week than Beasley against Miami. ... Since Week 5, the fifth-best tight end in fantasy has been Darren Fells. He's touchdown dependent, but most tight ends are. Off the bye and potentially a nice target for Deshaun Watson given how tough Baltimore's secondary is, Fells is available in 75% of ESPN leagues. ... With George Kittle likely out, the tight end that gets the most snaps against Arizona this week is likely to be Ross Dwelley. As desperation dart throws go, the tight end against Arizona has paid off a lot more often than not this year.\n\nPass Catchers I Hate in Week 11\n\nESPN Daily podcast Monday through Friday, host Mina Kimes brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nAllen Robinson II, Bears (at Rams): With Jalen Ramsey likely shadowing him and Mitch Trubisky on the road trying to get him the ball against the Rams' No. 1 scoring defense, lowering expectations for A Rob is the most likely outcome. In the past four weeks, the Rams are fourth best in opponent TD pass percentage, fifth in sack percentage and seventh in fewest yards per completion. A Rob has played great this year, but in Week 11, he's outside my top 20.\n\nMike Williams, Chargers (vs. Chiefs in Mexico City): One of these weeks Williams will go off, so since I am putting him on the \"Hate\" list, I'm sure it'll be this week. As you've read, I like Rivers, Gordon and Allen in this game, so this is not anti-Charger. But 69.6% of Williams' points have come on the perimeter this season, and KC allows the fewest completions to perimeter WRs and the third-lowest completion percentage to perimeter wideouts, and have allowed just one perimeter WR to score in eight of the past nine games. Williams has just seven targets in the two games since Ken Wisenhunt was fired, by the way.\n\nZach Ertz, Eagles (at Patriots): Ertz had the big week against the Bears, but prior to that he had three straight games outside the top 15 of tight ends and it gets no easier this week, off the bye. The Patriots allow the third-fewest TE PPG this season. If you have Ertz, you likely don't have better options, but just realize the odds say he is unlikely to provide significant fantasy upside this week.\n\nStefon Diggs, Vikings (vs. Broncos): Man, I hope I am wrong here, because I have Diggs on a team that desperately needs him this week. But with Adam Thielen likely out, my expectation is Diggs sees a lot of Chris Harris. That's not ideal, considering he's got just four catches for 53 yards (and zero touchdowns) in his past two games combined. In a game where Minnesota is likely up and up big, running all over Denver, it's worth noting the Broncos held Davante Adams (9.6 points), Allen Robinson (8.1), T.Y. Hilton (7.4) and Keenan Allen (5.8) to single-digit fantasy points this year.\n\nMatthew Berry -- The Talented Mr.Roto -- is now firmly anti-monkey bars.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/zoom-etiquette-youve-probably-broken-at-least-one-of-these-video-chat-rules/", "authors": ["Alison Denisco Rayome"], "title": "Zoom etiquette: You've probably broken at least one of these video chat rules", "text": "Sarah Tew/CNET\n\nWith coronavirus lockdowns and quarantines still in place in most states, many of us are using video chat as the main way to keep in touch with coworkers, family and friends. Whether you're using Zoom, Skype, FaceTime, Google Meet or Hangouts, Microsoft Teams or one of the other video chat services available, you've probably encountered some distracting video chat behaviors from colleagues and friends, taking your calls off the rails.\n\nHere are six ways you may be accidentally ruining your video chats and meetings, and how to avoid them.\n\nRead more: Zoom, Skype, FaceTime: 11 video chat app tricks to use during social distancing\n\nTyping or otherwise being noisy while not on mute\n\nIn my experience, this is the issue that comes up the most -- especially on large group calls.\n\nThere is always someone who forgets to mute, and suddenly the whole group is bombarded by sounds of loud typing, a microwave running, a dog barking or a child shouting. Of course, these all come with the territory of working from home. But it's all the more reason to keep yourself on mute unless you need to talk.\n\nNot muting is not only distracting in general, it also is disrespectful to the person who is trying to get a point across. Luckily, Zoom has a handy trick to help you avoid being That Person: Keep your audio muted automatically by going to Settings > Audio > Mute microphone. To quickly unmute when needed, just press and hold the space bar down.\n\nRead more: Webcams out of stock? Use your phone camera instead\n\nEating, drinking or smoking\n\nEspecially in smaller group calls, eating, drinking or smoking during a video meeting is a major distraction -- even more so that it would be in the office, because everything is laser-focused on your face. Try to follow the same rules you would if you were meeting in person.\n\nA caveat: Some people may find themselves in back-to-back video meetings all day, with no time to eat or grab coffee. In that case, if it's a more casual meeting, it's perfectly alright to make an exception. In smaller meetings, it would be considerate to ask if the group minded, or explain that you haven't had a sip of water for hours.\n\nLooking at your phone or laptop\n\nJust because you're at home doesn't mean everyone can't see you staring at your phone instead of paying attention to the video meeting. Keep your phone to the side and turned over so you're not tempted to glance at it. Looking away from the camera at other content on your laptop or monitor is also pretty obvious, and not the best look to whoever you're supposed to be paying attention to. Keep other tabs minimized and your focus on the meeting.\n\nIn a smaller meeting, it's courteous to explain why you're looking so focused off-camera. In a larger meeting, consider turning video off if you can't give the speaker your full attention.\n\nRead more: 5 ways to make video meetings a little less awkward, from a Google expert\n\nLeaving the frame without explaining why\n\nIf you need to get up from a meeting for any reason -- to go to the bathroom, get a drink or attend to a child or pet -- you should give the others a heads up if you can, either verbally or in the chat option included in many of these apps. That way it doesn't look like you've just disappeared for no reason. Otherwise, it's better to hold up a finger to indicate \"1 minute\" and turn off the video camera until your return to the ongoing call.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Weekend Zoom calls have exploded. Here's how the company...\n\nKeeping the camera at a weird angle\n\nWebcams can be tricky -- you may think your laptop is in a fine position on your desk or kitchen table, but all your video chat companions notice is that they can see up your nostrils. Avoid this fate by propping up your laptop on some books or investing in a small stand, so that your camera is at eye level or even pointing down (more tips on that below). That way, the angle won't take away from anything you have to say.\n\nFiguring out the tech while on the call\n\nThere's definitely a learning curve to telecommuting and using video conferencing services to host meetings and give presentations. But if you're going to be doing something you haven't done before -- like share your screen or play some audio -- do a trial run with a coworker or family member first, so you aren't fumbling and wasting time while on the call.

To actively listen and show that you're engaged, you should nod and smile as someone is talking. Practice active listening: For smaller group chats (and when you aren't typing, eating or otherwise making lots of extra noise), leave yourself unmuted to provide some verbal feedback (like \"mmhmm\" and \"OK\") to show active listening. In larger meetings, you can try speaking more slowly to avoid unintended interruptions, and give people time to interject if needed.\n\nFor more help on your video chats, check out tips for how to use Zoom like a pro, and how to change your background on Zoom and Microsoft Teams.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/06/08/carrie-underwood-southbound-video-watch/", "authors": ["Brandy Robidoux", "Music Writer"], "title": "Carrie Underwood Drops Fun-Loving \u2018Southbound\u2019 Music Video Featuring Her Family \u2014 Watch", "text": "Carrie Underwood is back with a new music video & it\u2019s one of her most personal yet!

In a randomized trial involving 103 COVID-19 patients, convalescent plasma made no difference in the time it took to show signs of improvement or in rates of death at 28 days versus a placebo. There were some potentially encouraging results among patients who were \"severely ill\" but not sick enough to be in the intensive care unit. They recovered roughly five days faster if they got the plasma treatment, and more of them improved within 28 days of starting treatment. The study was somewhat hampered as researchers were not able to enroll as many patients as they had hoped because the epidemic started to come under control in their region, and it was stopped early. Had they been able to enroll as many patients as originally planned, the results might have been different.

Overall, 821 people who had recently been exposed to the virus or lived in a high-risk household received either hydroxychloroquine or placebo. There was no significant difference in the rate at which participants developed COVID-19. \"Our data is pretty clear that for post exposure, this does not really work,\" lead researcher Dr. David Boulware told Reuters.\n\nMore than 20% of the patients in the trial also took zinc, which had no significant effect. Several trials of hydroxychloroquine have been stopped over concerns about its safety for treating COVID-19 patients, but the new trial found no serious side effects or heart problems with hydroxychloroquine. \"I think both sides - one side who is saying 'This is a dangerous drug' and the other side that says 'this works' - neither is correct,\" said Boulware. (; https://reut.rs/3eQcWn5)\n\n\n\n\n\nTiming, location of sample may impact coronavirus test results\n\nHow well nasal swab tests can identify coronavirus infection depends on how soon they are done after symptoms begin, infectious disease experts advised in a paper titled, \"Five Things to Know About Coronavirus Diagnosis Tests\" published on Wednesday in the CMAJ medical journal. They also point out that when coronavirus infection is predominantly affecting the lungs, swab samples from the nose and throat are going to be less accurate than samples obtained from sputum and from the windpipe and lungs. \"Lower respiratory tract samples may reveal a positive result when nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal sampling has not,\" they write. Furthermore, a positive test does not necessarily indicate how infectious someone may be. \"Laboratories report a 'yes/no' result and do not regularly report viral load\" - the amount of virus in the sample. A positive test long after symptoms have gone away probably is not caused by active virus, they add. For quick \"point of care\" coronavirus tests, they say, the advantage is a faster answer for the tested person. But those tests have to be processed one at a time, whereas slower testing methods allow for many samples to be processed simultaneously. Finally, they point out, having coronavirus antibodies in your blood - reflecting previous infection - does not equate with immunity.

Pooling evidence from 172 studies in 16 countries, researchers found frequent handwashing and good hygiene are also critical - though even all those measures combined cannot provide full protection. Much of the data were from epidemics caused by the SARS and MERS viruses in previous years, so the researchers admit the findings may have some limitations for the current pandemic. Still, they wrote on Tuesday in The Lancet medical journal, policy makers around the world need to \"promptly and adequately address\" shortages of face masks and eye protection. \"For healthcare workers and administrators, our findings suggest that N95 respirators might be more strongly associated with protection from viral transmission than surgical masks,\" but both of those are more protective than single-layer masks, the said. \"Eye protection might also add substantial protection.\" For the general public, \"face masks are associated with protection, even in non-healthcare settings, with either disposable surgical masks or reusable 12- to 16-layer cotton ones.\" (https://bit.ly/2AFI6OX; https://reut.rs/2XrQBX2)", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/2019-mlb-first-year-player-draft-no-pitchers-selected-in-top-six-picks-for-first-time-in-draft-history/", "authors": ["R.J.

His past three fights alone saw Nurmagomedov tap out Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier before putting Gaethje to sleep in his final appearance.\n\nNow that he\u2019s secured that coveted ranking in the pound-for-pound list, Nurmagomedov has done enough to feel fulfilled with his career and there\u2019s no need to fight again.\n\n\u201cToday I was ranked the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter so the mission is accomplished,\u201d Nurmagomedov said. \u201cWhat else is there to do?

It\u2019s also evidence of the Republican-dominated legislature\u2019s willingness to move closer in line with the majority of voters who favor a less punitive approach. The historic commutations come amid nationwide efforts to reduce punishment of low-level crimes and move the U.S. prison system in a more rehabilitative \u2014 or at least less punitive \u2014 direction.\n\nCriminal justice reform advocates like Ryan Kiesel, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma, agreed that the commutation news signaled a change but cautioned that the road ahead will be a long one.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFrom the 30,000-foot view, the criminal justice landscape is light-years ahead of where it was three or four years ago,\u201d Kiesel told The Washington Post. \u201cIt would have been impossible before State Question 780 passed in Oklahoma; that signaled to lawmakers there was an appetite for reform.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Oklahoma voters approved State Question 780 and 781, a pair of ballot measures that reclassified certain simple drug possession and nonviolent property crimes under $1,000 as misdemeanors instead of felonies and mandated that the cost savings would go to drug treatment and rehabilitation services. In January, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers voted to make the 2016 laws apply retroactively.\n\nThe commutations are just a fraction of the state\u2019s 26,334-person state prison population, but they mean a second chance for the hundreds of incarcerated people who will be freed as a result.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRose Ortiz of Gainesville, Tex., will be among those outside the Mabel Bassett Correctional Center in McLoud, Okla., on Monday waiting to welcome a loved one home. Ortiz\u2019s daughter, Calista, will be released and reunited with her husband and five kids \u2014 including a baby whom she gave birth to in prison.\n\nOrtiz told The Post on Saturday that she had doubts at first when she heard her daughter would be eligible for early release. Calista had tried before to get a reduction in her roughly seven-year sentence for drug possession even as she helped other women successfully file for their own early-release petitions.\n\n\u201cWhen you hear that, you wonder, \u2018Is this really going to happen?\u2019\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nAD\n\nAt a Friday news conference announcing that the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board had unanimously voted to recommend the sentences of 527 state inmates be commuted, first-term Republican Gov.

The state said the mass commutations will save taxpayers an estimated $11.9 million based on costs projected if the eligible prisoners served their full sentences.\n\nAD\n\nStitt said that in addition to releasing prisoners whose sentences were no longer consistent with their since-reclassified crimes, the Department of Corrections for the first time in state history held a \u201creentry\u201d fair behind prison walls. Prisoners being released Monday, along with those scheduled for release in the next six months, were connected with services such as housing and counseling support. In some cases, prisoners were able to secure state ID cards or driver\u2019s licenses before their release; though crucial, such documentation can be difficult to obtain for people returning from prison. The effort, Stitt said, was coordinated by a mix of state, local, nonprofit and faith groups.\n\n11 Eddie Warrior inmates received their drivers license or state ID cards today from the Muskogee County Tag Office thanks to an ODOC project. Many of them, shown here, will be discharging Monday after HB 1269 made State Question 780 retroactive. Congratulations, ladies! https://t.co/sqVeuTrAa0\n\nWith a majority of Oklahoma voters supportive of criminal justice reforms, lawmakers in the heavily red state where Republican legislators outnumber Democrats 3 to 1 are increasingly embracing a platform long associated with progressives.\n\nAD\n\nKris Steele, a Republican who served in the state legislature from 2000 to 2012, is now the executive director of Oklahomans for Criminal Justice Reform. In his view from within the state\u2019s Republican Party, Steele said criminal justice reform was barely on the radar during his time in the legislature.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor the first three or four elections, the methodology was to run a platform of \u2018tough on crime.\u2019 Political consultants advised that. There were even predesigned mail pieces with that messaging,\u201d Steele told The Post.\n\nBy contrast, during the most recent election cycle, Steele couldn\u2019t recall a major Republican candidate who ran on a punitive platform. \u201cI think the vast majority of candidates and incumbents ran a corrections reform message.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSteele said he suspects a few factors are behind the Oklahoma Republicans\u2019 embrace of criminal justice reform. One is a realization that over-incarceration is the definition of inefficient government, producing neither increased public safety nor less crime for the cost. There\u2019s also the issue of faith: The messages of criminal justice reform align with the same values at the center of Christianity, such as redemption, grace, forgiveness and second chances.\n\nAD\n\nBut a third factor Steele identifies is more stark: Oklahoma\u2019s incarceration rate is more than 10 times that of Canada, according to the Tulsa-based nonprofit think tank Oklahoma Policy Institute, meaning more than 1 in 100 Oklahoma adults is locked up at any given time.\n\n\u201cThe sad reality is, we\u2019ve reached a point of saturation, given our high incarceration rate: If it\u2019s not your loved one, chances are, it\u2019s a friend,\u201d Steele said. \u201cThe proximity, in many ways, has changed people\u2019s thinking.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Oklahoma will be pivoting hard toward reform with any speed. As Steele notes, local district attorneys and law enforcement allies are among the staunchest, and most effective, holdouts. \u201cThey tend to be very effective in the legislature in thwarting or slowing these [reform] efforts,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nFor Ortiz, who will see her daughter outside of prison walls for the first time in two years, the wait has been long enough. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed having her around as a mom, sister and daughter,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nMonday\u2019s reunion for Calista will probably include dinner with her siblings and will definitely include a lot of hugs for her children \u2014 especially the baby. Ortiz said that because she lives 2\u00bd hours from the prison, the family wasn\u2019t able to bring the baby to visit as often as Calista would have liked.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen you have a little baby, every day is important. Every week, every month is important,\u201d Ortiz said. She reflected on her daughter\u2019s time incarcerated and added, \u201cShe\u2019s had to miss a lot.\u201d\n\nRead more:", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Fri Nov 01 23:23:54 +0000 2019", "id": 1190409156232175616, "id_str": "1190409156232175616", "full_text": "Hand delivering 524 signed commutations to be processed in time for the release of hundreds of non-violent, low-level inmates across our state on Monday.

legalizes magic mushrooms: 5 things to know", "text": "Oregon became the first state in the nation to legalize psilocybin in therapeutic settings Tuesday. Measure 109 passed with 56% of the vote, as more than a million Oregonians said yes to the measure.\n\nHere are five things to know about the groundbreaking new law.\n\nIt will be at least two years before psilocybin therapy is available.\n\nThe new law will create a framework for using mushrooms in a therapeutic setting.\n\nThe measure, from chief petitioners wife-and-husband Sheri and Thomas Eckert of Beaverton, will create a two-year period during which regulatory details will be worked out, including what qualifications are required of therapists overseeing its use.\n\nPsychedelic mushrooms will not be distributed like cannabis or alcohol.\n\nPsilocybin won\u2019t be available to purchase and take home. Only license holders will be able to cultivate psilocybin or provide the therapy or own a psilocybin service center under the new law\n\nAnd it does not allow people to take or grow psychedelic mushrooms in their homes, or leave a treatment facility while still under the influence of psilocybin.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority will be responsible for the program, unlike cannabis, which is managed by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission.\n\nAccording to the chief petitioners, therapy recipients will go through a pre-screening, a supervised therapy session and a post-use evaluation.\n\nYou won\u2019t necessarily need to be suffering from mental health issues to use psilocybin,\n\nThe treatment isn\u2019t only for Oregonians struggling with mental health problems. Anyone age 21 or older who passes a screening will be able to access the services for \u201cpersonal development,\u201d according to the Eckerts.\n\nA soap company was a huge backer of this measure.\n\nDr. Bronner\u2019s soap company donated more than $1 million directly to the yes campaign for Measure 109 and provided most of the money behind a political committee that gave another $1.5 million.\n\nPsilocybin is still a Schedule I drug.\n\nFederal law classifies psilocybin as a Schedule I drug, like LSD and marijuana, and the Drug Enforcement Agency cautions it may cause temporary physical or mental harm in some cases. Federal officials note that it is not addictive.\n\nHowever, on Tuesday, Oregon passed a law decriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs including heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, LSD, psilocybin, methadone and oxycodone.\n\nBryce Dole and Jamie Hale contributed to this story.\n\n-- Lizzy Acker\n\n503-221-8052, lacker@oregonian.com, @lizzzyacker", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-11-12-20-intl/h_4f0e7093337d282647f59eec8f2de32b", "authors": ["Julia Hollingsworth", "Jenni Marsh", "Zamira Rahim", "Ed Upright", "Roya Wolverson", "Joshua Berlinger"], "title": "States shatter Covid-19 records as US reports more than 10.5 million cases and 240,000 deaths", "text": "RN Treva Rivers administers a Covid-19 test at FirstEnergy Stadium in Reading, Pennsylvania, on October 13.

Most hospitalized patients are aged 65 or older, and most of the deaths have been among patients 65 or older.\n\nUtah\n\nThe state reported 3,884 new Covid-19 cases Thursday -- a new record that is a significant jump above previous high, its data dashboard shows. Utah also hit record highs in its Covid-19 7-day case average and test positivity percentage.\n\nUtah\u2019s previous record for new Covid-19 cases, 2,989, was set on November 5.\n\nThe rise in infections has driven the seven-day new case average to a record 2,738.4 cases. This measure has been climbing fairly steadily since the start of October. Utah\u2019s percentage of positive tests also hit a record 23.21% after surging since October 11.\n\nGreg Bell, the President of the Utah Hospital Association, said the state was running out of intensive care beds and that the state has \u201cin earnest, began transferring patients about 10 days ago\u201d from hospitals at capacity.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nThe state hit its highest Covid-19 hospitalization rate since June 4 with 1,827 in hospital. Since Monday, the state has seen 10,472 new cases, which Governor Phil Murphy said was \"stark and sobering,\"\n\nMurphy announced 3,517 new Covid-19 cases, 18 deaths, and a positivity rate of 12.02%. There are 360 Covid-19 patients in intensive care, the highest rate since June 12.\n\nDepartment of Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said that if New Jersey continues at this trajectory, it will return to the state it was in back in spring.\n\nMurphy said holiday gatherings should be limited to immediate family or household.\n\nIn the past week, there have been 15 outbreaks at schools and 46 new Covid-19 infections, which Murphy noted was much lower than he and his staff were expecting.\n\nWisconsin\n\nCovid-19 is \"getting worse everywhere\" in the state, said a top health official as Wisconsin reached almost 7,500 new cases on Thursday.\n\nThe 7,497 new cases bring the state's total to 293,388, Julie Willems Van Dijk, Deputy Secretary of Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said at a news conference. She also announced 58 new deaths bringing the state's total to 2,515.\n\n\"Covid-19 is everywhere in our state. It is bad everywhere, and it's getting worse everywhere,\" she said. \"It is straining hospitals and people are dying.\"\n\nVan Dijk said that only 8% of ICU beds are available statewide and that hospitals are struggling with staffing, partly because staff are sick or quarantining.\n\nThe seven-day rolling average of new cases is 6,209, Van Dijk said. She said Wisconsin has 1,000 cases per day higher than New York City during the height of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo said in a news release Thursday that the state\u2019s positivity rate is 2.95% and 29 more people died from coronavirus in a 24-hour period.\n\nIn the state's \"micro-cluster\" focus zones, the test positivity rate is 4.86%.\n\nThe governor said the next few weeks are going to be \u201ckey,\" with Covid raging nationally.\n\n\"There is no pre-destined future here. It's a pure consequence of our actions.

Mimi Groves was still a child when she said, in a Snapchat recording, \u201cI can drive\u201d followed by the \u201cn-word\u201d -- the racial slur.Jimmy Galligan, a half-black student who graduated from Heritage High School in Virginia this past spring with Groves, obtained this video during their senior year. Per Galligan himself, he waited until Groves had been accepted to, and chose to enroll at, the University of Tennessee-Knoxville to release the video -- which went viral.The resulting firestorm led to a torrent of abuse, and to an ultimatum from the University of Tennessee to Groves: withdraw voluntarily or have your offer of admission rescinded. Groves, who is white, chose the former and is now taking courses at a local community college instead of at her dream school -- the reckoning.Should the former two have led to the third on the scale that Groves is now facing? Any reasonable person would say no. Even conceding the obvious -- she shouldn\u2019t have used that slur in any context -- there\u2019s little indication she used it out of hatred for black people. In fact, the context seems clear: Groves said it casually, as hundreds of hip-hop tracks do every year. That doesn\u2019t excuse the behavior, which should be considered unacceptable. But it is an important distinction from using the slur with animus, which was obviously not her intention.There are many to blame for what\u2019s happened. If Groves can be held responsible for a poor decision rendered in her mid teens, surely Galligan can be as well for deliberately trying to ruin a classmate\u2019s life four years later -- a worse crime at a more mature age. But regardless of Galligan\u2019s culpability, institutions such as the University of Tennessee and the New York Times are far more deserving of scorn than either of these Virginia teens.At the university, cowardice won the day. Facing calls on social media for Groves\u2019s acceptance to be rescinded, administrators bowed to pressure from a vocal minority, forgoing what was right to do what was most convenient. It was easier for university officials to hang Groves out to dry than to withstand the intense but brief storm themselves. So that\u2019s what they did.Their decision had nothing to do with racial or any other kind of justice. They didn\u2019t care if Groves would feel \u201ccomfortable on campus\u201d -- language they used to persuade her to withdraw prior to handing her the ultimatum -- and they didn\u2019t honestly believe that black students on campus would be at risk were she to enroll. The only thing that mattered to them was escaping the situation with as little effort and scrutiny as possible. Forget taking a stand and explaining why they wouldn\u2019t punish a young woman for a mistake she made as a child. It was all about damage control. I wonder how many of us would ultimately qualify for acceptance to the University of Tennessee were we held to the same standard as Mimi Groves from our freshman years of high school onward.And at the Times, disgraceful (yet now familiar) behavior also won out. To signal approval of Galligan\u2019s behavior to readers without outright endorsing it, Dan Levin, the article\u2019s author, notes that Galligan had \u201cmade a decision that would ricochet across Leesburg, Va., a town named for an ancestor of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee and whose school system had fought an order to desegregate for more than a decade after the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling.\u201d The ridiculous implication is that the name of Groves\u2019s town and its opposition to integration over 50 years ago justified her treatment.Levin adds that \u201cthe story behind the backlash also reveals a more complex portrait of behavior that for generations had gone unchecked in schools in one of the nation\u2019s wealthiest counties, where Black students said they had long been subjected to ridicule\u201d before going on to share the stories of students who were forced to endure appalling racist treatment by their classmates or even have \u201cUnderground Railroad\u201d games forced on them in gym class. As maddening as these stories are, they describe people guilty of far worse than Groves\u2019s offense. Levin\u2019s attempt to blur the lines between her case and more damning ones is contemptible -- or worse.Levin also records an anecdote from Galligan that helpfully illuminates just how wrong what Galligan did was:> Mr. Galligan thinks a lot about race, and the implications of racial slurs. He said his father was often the only white person at maternal family gatherings, where \u201cthe N-word is a term that is thrown around sometimes\u201d by Black relatives. A few years ago, he said his father said it aloud, prompting Mr. Galligan and his sister to quietly take him aside and explain that it was unacceptable, even when joking around.Just a few paragraphs later:> For his role, Mr. Galligan said he had no regrets. \u201cIf I never posted that video, nothing would have ever happened,\u201d he said. And because the internet never forgets, the clip will always be available to watch.> > \u201cI\u2019m going to remind myself, you started something,\u201d he said with satisfaction. \u201cYou taught someone a lesson.\u201dFor his father, Galligan calmly explained why using slurs -- even casually -- is wrong. For Groves, he summoned national opprobrium on her and her family and denied her the opportunity to attend her dream school.

Economic fallout hits poorer Californians hardest, and infection and death rates among Latino and Black communities tower over those in white communities, where more have the means to stay home.\n\nA remarkable role reversal in mobility emerges as a product and producer of that growing disparity.\n\nSocial distancing varies by income, a new study published by UC Davis to the National Academy of Sciences shows. America\u2019s wealthiest, who are typically the country\u2019s most mobile, became its most stationary as the coronavirus spread, while poorer people went from the most inert to the biggest movers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople in poor areas may be at more risk of infection because they are social distancing less,\u201d economist Joakim Weill said.\n\nWealthier people became the least mobile because they can adapt their work and consumption, said Michael Springborn, a UC Davis professor who worked with Weill and studies environmental and resource economics.\n\n\u201cFlexibility almost certainly increases with your level of income. \u2026 The more income you have, the more flexibility you have,\u201d Springborn said. \u201cLower-income communities tend to have jobs that are typically considered essential work and lend themselves less to work from home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may have less liquidity and less cash on hand, and that may force them to do more trips to buy groceries, for instance,\u201d Weill added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe economists identified the trend after splitting America\u2019s counties and census tracts into five different income groups based on median income. Using mobile location data, they then compared income to the mobility of people living within each area. The results show a stark difference between upper-class and working people.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a massive jump as you get to that final category,\u201d Springborn said, referring to the elevated percentage of people staying completely at home in America\u2019s wealthiest census tracts, where median income sits between $40,500 and $148,000. Among the three poorest quintiles, the measure of people staying completely at home bunches together at a rate nearly a fifth smaller than the richest group\u2019s, representing a large, mobile working class.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of the distribution of income level in the United States. You have a lot of people earning a relatively low or modest amount, and then a much smaller amount of communities that are really, really far out on the high end,\u201d Springborn said. Non-wealthy people\u2019s increased coronavirus exposure fits alongside their higher rates of preexisting health conditions and decreased access to quality healthcare, Springborn said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear from various lines of evidence that poor communities are bearing a disproportionate share of the burden of the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Los Angeles, communities with higher poverty rates have three times as many cases as wealthier communities, Advancement Project senior fellow Maria Cabildo said. Cabildo foresaw the coronavirus\u2019 spread to Los Angeles\u2019 poorer areas back when the virus was reported to primarily affect wealthy people.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even get a test unless you\u2019d been traveling. You need to have been in China or have been in Italy. I had a sense, like, this is going to happen ... this thing\u2019s going to spread into our communities,\u201d the born East-sider said. Skyrocketing mortality rates for Latino and Black Angelenos prove her expectations turned true, she said. The coronavirus ravaged poor communities while slowing in wealthier ones.\n\nPoor households \u2014 often facing eviction, food shortage and more unmet needs \u2014 don\u2019t have the flexibility to choose safety over money, so they have to go out and face exposure, Cabildo said.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re lucky enough to have a family member that\u2019s working, they\u2019re out working,\u201d she said. \u201cThe consequence of that is people come into contact with many more people.\u201d That increased exposure combines with other factors, like higher home density, to devastate poor Latino and Black households in Los Angeles, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe owe something to these workers, who are moving L.A. forward so that the rest of us can shelter in place. We have to respond with resources in those communities that are most severely impacted,\u201d she said.\n\nSpringborn and Weill, whose research team also included academics from UC Santa Barbara and Stanford, said their findings should inform policy decisions too.\n\n\u201cThese type of findings should urge them to really consider prioritizing lower communities in the distribution of vaccines,\u201d Weill said.

An investigation into these allegations will commence immediately. There is no room for hate at LPD. We will get to the truth.\u201d\n\nZacharek was one of three new LPD officers announced by the department in June. An LPD release from that time said Zacharek was originally from Edwards, New York, who attended Penn State University and served three years as a tank crewman in the U.S. Army. \u201cHe visited Lafayette and fell in love with the community,\u201d LPD wrote at the time.\n\nIn data posted by the site IronWatch.Exposed, a user going by Panzerleiter on Iron Watch was created by someone with a Google mail account under Zacharek\u2019s name. The bio for the user named Panzerleiter at Iron Watch also claimed to be a tank crewman in the U.S. Army who registered in upstate New York. Panzer is a German tank. Leiter, in German, means leader or chief or conductor.\n\nLt.

It asks the justices to wade into a treacherous territory that has divided the Court and the county for decades and been at the center of election campaigns and countless judicial confirmation hearings.\n\nThis is the first major abortion case that will be heard by President Donald Trump's two nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, and it shines a light on Chief Justice John Roberts , who sided with the liberals last year to temporarily block the law, perhaps in order to give the justices time to issue a reasoned opinion. The case will be decided by July, just as the presidential election is heating up.\n\nIt was only in 2016, when Justice Anthony Kennedy was still on the bench, that the Court struck down a similar law out of Texas . Much has changed since then, however, as Kennedy has been replaced by Kavanaugh, who is considered more conservative on the issue. Supporters of abortion rights fear not only that the recent precedent is in jeopardy but that the Court's new conservative majority might begin to chip away at landmark opinions including Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld a woman's right to have an abortion.\n\nIf Louisiana prevails, it will likely embolden other states to pass similar laws.\n\n\"Disappointingly, we find ourselves back at the Supreme Court this term challenging a Louisiana law designed to shut down clinics,\" said Nancy Northup, the President of the Center for Reproductive Rights, the group behind the challenge. She charged Louisiana with \"openly defying\" the Supreme Court's 2016 ruling.\n\nAs is often the case, the vote of Roberts could be key. In 2016 he voted in favor of the Texas law, but last year, he sided with the liberals to block the Louisiana law from going into effect before the Supreme Court could hear arguments. Although heartened by Roberts' preliminary vote, opponents of the law are nervous he simply wanted to freeze the state of play to give the Court time to have oral arguments and distinguish the circumstances in Louisiana from those in Texas.\n\nAlthough he is a conservative justice, Roberts cares about the institutional reputation of the Court and might move cautiously before voting to overturn such recent precedent.\n\nLouisiana's Unsafe Abortion Protection Act, blocked since its enactment in 2014 is an effort, state officials argue, to \"improve abortion safety by means of doctor credentialing.\"\n\nLouisiana Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Murrill says that clinics in the state have a \"long disturbing\" history of serious health and safety problems, abortion carries \"known risks for serious complications\" and that the act would bring abortion practice \"into conformity\" with the privilege requirements for doctors performing other outpatient surgeries. The penalty for violating the law is not more than $4,000 per violation.\n\nAs a threshold matter, Murrill argues that the justices shouldn't even get to the merits of the case because the doctors and the clinics bringing the case don't have the legal right -- or \"standing\" -- to be in court. Murrill notes that Louisiana women can challenge abortion regulations if they wish to do so -- \"as individual women have done in numerous other abortion cases across the country\" -- but that the clinics and doctors can't stand in their place. She said that's because the interests of a for-profit business that exchanges medical services for a fee might not align with patients seeking an abortion.\n\nMore than 200 members of Congress, including two Democratic House members, filed a brief in support of Louisiana on that point. They say there is an inherent conflict of interest between abortion providers and their patients when it comes to health and safety regulations.\n\n\"It is impossible for abortion clinics and doctors to share or represent the interests of their patients when they seek to eliminate the very regulations designed to protect their patients' health and safety,\" the lawmakers stated.\n\nThe Trump administration supports that position and argues that the law is valid . \"Act 620 would not create a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion for a large fraction of Louisiana women seeking one -- let alone all such women,\" Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the Court.\n\nThe administration argues that the Court might need to narrow or overrule the Texas case from 2016 because it conflicts with the Court's older precedent.\n\nThe claims are rejected by lawyers for the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing two doctors and an abortion clinic in the state who say that if the law had been able to go into effect when it passed, it would have forced the closure of two of the state's three remaining clinics and left only one doctor with the ability to provide abortion care.\n\nThey argue the law serves no valid credentialing function and will force women to increase travel times and wait longer for the procedure. \"Because Act 620 provides no benefits, it unduly burdens a woman's Fourteenth Amendment right to pre-viability abortion,\" Julie Rikelman, an attorney with the Center for Reproductive Rights, argued. She said that it is extremely hard to obtain admitting privileges in the state and that denials often have nothing to do with a doctor's competency to provide abortion care.\n\nRikelman also rejects the notion that only women seeking abortions could bring the suit, noting that a woman would only have a narrow time frame to bring such a suit and that such litigation often lasts for years. She stresses the close relationship between doctor and patient.\n\nThe appeals court took the unusual move of engaging in some fact finding, a task often handled by district courts, and concluded that the doctors had not made a good faith effort to get the credentials.\n\n\"There is insufficient evidence to conclude that, had the doctors put forth a good faith effort to comply with Act 620, they would have been unable to obtain privileges,\" the court held. \"Instead of demonstrating an undue burden on a large fraction of women,\" the court said, the law \"at most shows an insubstantial burden on a small fraction of women.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Nancy Northup's name.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1339427/China-Australia-news-ban-academics-attack-China-national-security-trade-war", "authors": ["Rebecca Perring"], "title": "China bans two Australian academics from entering country \u2013 blames national security", "text": "China has barred entry to two 'anti-China' Australian scholars\n\nFREE now and never miss the top politics stories again.

He had opened a small, nautical-themed market in South Pasadena in 1967 and watched it grow into an empire of nearly 500 stores nationwide.\n\nBut today that empire, known for its trading-post motif and international product lines, has come under attack for its branding of ethnic foods. The names Trader Ming\u2019s, Arabian Joe\u2019s, Trader Jose\u2019s, Trader Giotto\u2019s and Trader Joe San appear on items such as haba\u00f1ero and lime salsa, gyoza dipping sauce and artichoke antipasto.\n\nThe popular Southern California institution has created \u201ca narrative of exoticism,\u201d according to an online petition posted about two weeks ago calling for Trader Joe\u2019s to remove and rebrand a variety of products with \u201cracist\u201d labeling.\n\n\u201cThe Trader Joe\u2019s branding is racist because it exoticizes other cultures \u2014 it presents \u2018Joe\u2019 as the default \u2018normal\u2019 and the other characters falling outside of it,\u201d said the petition posted by 17-year-old Briones Bedell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, Trader Joe\u2019s \u2014 which Coulombe sold in 1979 to German supermarket chain Aldi \u2014 acknowledged that its approach to product naming, \u201crooted in a lighthearted attempt at inclusiveness ... may now have the opposite effect.\u201d A spokeswoman said the company is changing the packaging and expects to complete the process \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nWhat once was considered successful marketing has been shaken by a cultural moment that took hold in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death and the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s had famously thrived on the presumption that all\u2019s fair in the name of free enterprise and commerce, and consumers responded, drawn to its quirky themes and budget pricing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut over the last few months, public spaces have lost statues, buildings have been stripped of names, and now consumer products are having a day of reckoning amid a nationwide reconsideration of once popularly accepted precepts.\n\nLand O\u2019Lakes has removed the image of a Native American woman from its butter products, and images of Black men and women on product lines such as Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben\u2019s and Mrs. Butterworth\u2019s are in for a makeover, if they survive at all. The Eskimo Pie name also is being replaced.\n\n\u201cLong gone are the days when the communication between brands and consumers was one way,\u201d said Maria Rodas, a professor of marketing at USC. \u201cConsumers have more power than ever, given the huge amount of information at their fingertips, how connected they all are and the easy access to social media platforms that help broadcast their messages.\u201d\n\nRodas is not surprised that Trader Joe\u2019s has come under fire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBrands are symbols, and some of them are even cultural symbols,\u201d she said. \u201cYears ago, people would buy a product mainly for its functional benefits, but now people expect more of brands and hold them to higher standards.\u201d\n\nCultural critic M.G. Lord, whose book \u201cForever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll,\u201d examined popular perceptions of that icon, wonders why these brand names were not eliminated sooner. She cites Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben\u2019s in particular.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Aunt\u2019 and \u2018Uncle\u2019 clearly reference the way honorifics like \u2018Mrs.\u2019 and \u2018Mr.\u2019 were withheld from older enslaved people,\u201d Lord said Monday.\n\nIn her petition, Briones also calls into question the company\u2019s story about the origin of the market\u2019s nautical theme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, at the time Coulombe founded the chain, he \u201chad been reading a book called \u2018White Shadows in the South Seas,\u2019 and he\u2019d been to the Disneyland Jungle Trip ride, and it all just \u2026 coalesced.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cWhite Shadows,\u201d written by Frederick O\u2019Brien and published in 1919, is far from romantic. The book, according to critics, portrays white capitalists as destroyers of native culture. The story was made into a 1928 silent movie that was considered a technical and artistic landmark at the time.\n\nBut Briones and other critics accuse the narrative of \u201cperpetuating the myth of the noble savage and the white god.\u201d Her petition also criticizes the use of stereotypes in Disneyland\u2019s Jungle Cruise.\n\nInside the Trader Joe\u2019s in Temecula, shoppers crowded the aisles on Monday.

The new facility is expected to start meaningful production of the Standard Range Model 3 in Q4, as the company looks to bring a cheaper Tesla EV to the Chinese market. Amidst a growing trade war, this new factory comes at an interesting time, with some major questions still to be answered.\n\nCurrently, Tesla offers three versions of the Model 3 in China, since the Long Range rear wheel drive version disappeared from the order page site last week. These vehicles must be imported from the United States, and the expected delivery date depends on how much inventory is there - the Long Range model shows a 1-4 week estimate, while the Standard Range shows as being available in September, and the Performance version in November. The Chinese Model 3 order page can be found below.\n\n(Source: Tesla China Model 3 page, seen here, with Google translate used)\n\nYou can see that the cheapest version currently available goes for 355,900 Yuan, while the Chinese built vehicle is listed at 328,000 Yuan. Now there is a disclaimer there that the price is not final, so we'll see what actually happens in the next couple of months. There are a couple of major factors at play here that need to be discussed.\n\nFirst of all is the increasing US / China trade war, which saw an increase in tensions last week. As a result, auto tariffs are set to rise again on US exported vehicles to China, which likely means Tesla will have to raise prices on the US built versions or take a significant hit to its margins. Unfortunately, demand may already be waning, because only 4 ships have left for China this quarter according to the Tesla ship tracker as opposed to 7 in Q2. Auto parts will also see some tariffs, so it will be interesting to see how much of the Shanghai built Model 3 is imported.\n\nThe other important item for Tesla China is the ongoing weakening of the Yuan, which can be seen in the chart below. If you remember above that US built Model 3, it has gone from a translated price of $53,119 at an exchange rate of 6.7 to a price of $49,707 at the current rate of 7.16. That's going to definitely impact average selling prices as well as margins a bit.\n\n(Source: cnbc.com, see quote here)\n\nThe initial plan for the Shanghai gigafactory is 3,000 units per week, so we'll round to 150,000 units a year taking into account 2 weeks for factory maintenance. These vehicles are only going to be the Standard Range version, so that means they will be the lowest margin units of the line. If we assume that 328,000 Yuan price remains as is, which translates to $45,810, let's try to look at the financial impact.\n\nWith Model 3 gross margins currently around 20%, I've been modeling a gross margin for the Standard range at 12%. Assuming that price above and Tesla can get Shanghai gross margins to be 20% at that annual volume, given lower costs in China, you'd be looking at around $6.87 billion in additional revenues and $1.374 billion in gross margin dollars. Obviously there will also be additional operating expenses, interest costs, taxes, etc. that will factor in, so the final profit could easily be much lower.\n\nAnother thing to consider will be the loss of current revenues and gross margin dollars from those sales no longer going to China. Customers won't need to buy a Standard Range model 3 anymore from the US, and there may be a loss of some Long Range sales as well as consumers trade down. According to estimates, Tesla had over 13,000 Model 3 sales in the first half of the year in China, once it started shipping to that country a few months in. Most of those were likely the long range versions with the Standard Range not going international right away.\n\nThe China estimates link in the prior paragraph shows the country's leading EV vehicle at just under 50,000 sales in the first half of the year. However, that model goes for 215,000 Yuan, and there are a number of other decent range electric vehicles that go for much less than that, with new competitors also cropping up over time. At 328,000 Yuan, or perhaps more once the price is finalized, Tesla will need an incredible value proposition to get to 150,000 units a year. The BYD Qin Pro EV, for example, has a comparable range and price much lower than the Model 3, and it had just over 10,000 units in the first half of 2019.\n\nIn the end, Tesla's Shanghai gigafactory will be an interesting item to watch in the coming months. The US / China trade war has resulted in more tariffs, which likely means Tesla will be raising prices in China, especially thanks to the Yuan depreciation. The real question is can Tesla find demand for 150,000 units a year in China, given the Model 3 will be much more expensive than most EVs in that country. China's two leading EV unit sellers were under 50,000 units in the first half of the year, with one of them being 35% cheaper and the other being about 65% cheaper than the currently expected price of the China built Model 3. If Tesla can't get demand to a reasonable level, then the financial impact from the Shanghai gigafactory for the Model 3 will likely be limited once you consider the lost sales of US imported Tesla units.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

We've charted the last 50 goals allowed by each goalie in the regular season and every goal in the postseason, with the help of Apex Video Analysis and Save Review System from Upper Hand Inc., to see what patterns emerge.\n\nFor the first time in NHL history, the 2020 Stanley Cup Final will involve two starting goalies who have represented Russia internationally when Andrei Vasilevskiy of the Tampa Bay Lightning opposes Anton Khudobin of the Dallas Stars.\n\nKhudobin, who was born in Kazakhstan, and the Russia-born Vasilevskiy are each known for acrobatic, athletic saves, but the comparisons end there. From size to style to positioning, their approaches are very different and require different methods of attack to avoid strengths and attack weaknesses in the best-of-7 series when it begins at Rogers Place in Edmonton, the hub city for the Final.\n\nGame 1 is Saturday (7:30 p.m. ET; NBC, CBC, SN, TVAS).\n\n[RELATED: Complete Stanley Cup Final coverage]\n\nANDREI VASILEVSKIY, TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING\n\nThere aren't a lot of glaring weaknesses for Vasilevskiy, who is again a Vezina Trophy finalist one season after winning the award for the first time. He's had an impressive postseason (14-5-0 with a 1.82 goals-against average and .931 save percentage) to help the Lightning become the only team to advance to a conference final without needing to start a second goalie or play a Game 7. With explosive movement added to a solid technical foundation, Vasilevskiy has established himself as one of the best goalies in the NHL, but there are trends that can be targeted.\n\nGoal trends\n\nGet him on the iron: Post integration played a role in 20 percent of tracked goals in the regular season, nine of 40 in the postseason (22.5 percent), and the New York Islanders seemed intent on targeting it in the Eastern Conference Final, scoring three times in those situations. That included Devon Toews' wraparound goal in Game 6, and a low-high pass out to Anthony Beauvillier in Game 3. It doesn't always have to be attacks from the goal line either. Vasilevskiy tends to stay on his post and sit in reverse-VH, a tactic in which the short-side pad is along the ice against the post and the back pad is up and that skate is used to push his body into the post and pivot around it, even after the puck moves away from a sharp angle, or sometimes before it gets there. The tendency cost him on a shot from the hash marks along the boards against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Islanders forward Brock Nelson caught him leaning into his post with a Game 3 shot from above the bottom of the face-off circle, and it can also delay his movements getting off the post to quick shots.\n\nAgainst the grain: As quick as Vasilevskiy is, he still gets caught in motion rather than beating plays and getting set. It shows up in his goal totals on shots directed against the flow. Thirty percent of his regular-season goals came on shots against the grain, almost double the 17.7 percent average for more than 6,000 goals tracked during four years of this project, and the Islanders scored five of their 11 goals (45 percent) in the series in this manner.\n\nLooking over traffic: Vasilevskiy has always tried to look over screens rather than around them, almost standing straight up like he's on tippy toes. A late transition to the ice didn't cost him as many goals along the ice as past seasons, but he can get caught dropping from that high stance with shots back up high, and it played a role in several of the surprisingly high 14 mid- and high-glove goals in the regular season (28 percent), and nine in the postseason (22.5 percent)\n\nInto the body on the blocker side: Though the top corner is the target on the glove side, there's not the same need to be perfect on the blocker. Vasilevskiy has allowed six such goals (11.4 percent) among the tracked regular-season goals, more than double the 4.7 percent average. He has allowed five such goals (12.5 percent) in the postseason.\n\nQuick releases: Lateral passes and one-timers are a good way to beat any goalie, and it may say how well Vasilevskiy is playing that it's taken those types of plays to score on him in the postseason. Quick releases and one-timers played a role in 55 percent of the goals, including seven of 11 against New York, up from 30 percent in the regular season and above the 37.4 percent tracked average.\n\nPucks off pads: Rebound goals weren't an issue against the Islanders but they are up in the postseason to 25 percent from 14 percent in the regular season, and Vasilevskiy's pads are designed to create active rebounds that come off hot, so forwards may want to establish position further away from crease to take advantage of those opportunities.\n\nANTON KHUDOBIN, DALLAS STARS\n\nKhudobin went into the West Final with a .909 save percentage in the playoffs but looked a lot more like the goalie who led the NHL with a .930 save percentage in the regular season while saving 153 of 161 shots (.950 save percentage) against the Vegas Golden Knights. The key for Tampa Bay will be creating chances that gave Khudobin trouble earlier in the playoffs. To do that, they need to counter his strengths, which are highlighted by an ability to read plays and shot releases and using quick feet to get out past the top of his crease to make up for his 5-foot-11 height.\n\nGoal trends\n\nLayered screens and chaos: Reading plays, positional aggression and patience on his skates are hallmarks of Khudobin's game, so it's not surprising that he struggles with traffic that pushes him deeper into his crease and makes it harder to see the puck because he's not tall enough to look over traffic. His regular-season totals for goals involving screens (28.6 percent) and deflections (25.2 percent) were already well above the tracked averages for all goalies, and they jumped to 48.8 percent for screens and 31.7 percent for deflections through the first two rounds. In the conference final, Vegas scored twice with traffic and twice more on deflections but too often settled for single-player screens, which Khudobin managed to look around with relative ease. Vegas didn't create enough of the broken-play scrambles that led to goals against Khudobin earlier in the playoffs.\n\nRebounds, but elevate: A by-product of shots into traffic is rebounds. Khudobin will control most of the shots he sees, as evidenced by his regular-season rebound goal totals (21.9 percent) being slightly worse than the average (20 percent). Those numbers were up through two rounds of the postseason (24.4 percent), with broken-play scrambles accounting for nine of those 10 goals, but the Golden Knights didn't manage any such goals, in part because they failed to elevate some of their best chances. As Mark Stone and Alex Tuch found out after Khudobin robbed them in the final seven minutes of Game 3 with the score tied 2-2, anything along the ice gives the athletic, never-give-up Khudobin the opportunity to get a pad there.\n\nMove him one way, shoot the other: Vegas did take advantage of Khudobin's extra movement by shooting against the grain on three of their eight goals, including a long-range Alex Martinez goal in Game 4. Catching Khudobin moving one way with shots the other way has accounted for 36.7 percent of the goals against Khudobin in the postseason, up from his regular-season total (28.6 percent), which was already well above the 17.7 percent average. Max Pacioretty beat him from distance off the rush in Game 4 with an against-the-grain shot, but hit the post, and it's not the only time he's been beat clean this way, something Tampa Bay's skilled forwards might want to target more often than Vegas.\n\nGlove side: Of the goals Khudobin has allowed in the playoffs, 48.7 percent of them went in on the glove side, above the pad. That was well above the 29.5 percent average, after two rounds, but it was noted 13 of those 22 goals involved screens and those numbers don't represent a save percentage. Reilly Smith scored over the glove with a clean shot off the rush in Game 5, but Vegas only scored twice there in the series.

The story: That he hadn\u2019t yelled \u201cfore\u201d during the second round of The Open, resulting in both a marshal and a caddie\u2019s mother getting hit by his errant shots.\n\nIn a story in the Scotsman, Stanley\u2019s playing partner, Robert MacIntyre, unloaded on Stanley. \u201cMy playing partner doesn\u2019t shout \u2018fore,\u2019 his ball goes into the crowd, we\u2019re shouting \u2018fore\u2019 as the ball is coming into the crowd,\u201d MacIntyre told the newspaper. \u201cHe\u2019s just standing, watching it. And people didn\u2019t have enough time to react when we shouted.\u201d\n\nStanley met with reporters after a third-round 73 Saturday to offer his side of the story. He said that because five to seven people on the tee immediately alerted the crowd that an errant drive was incoming, he didn\u2019t bother.\n\n\u201cIf his issue was with me not being the first person to say \u2018fore,\u2019 I mean, does he have a point? Does he not have a point? That\u2019s up to him,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cAll I know is after I hit the ball, it wasn\u2019t but a couple of seconds before several people on the tee box started shouting \u2018fore.\u2019 I thought that was enough. My intention was never to do anything negative or put anybody in the gallery in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nFull-field scores from the 148th Open Championship\n\nFull coverage of the 148th Open Championship\n\nMacIntyre had taken exception with two separate incidents, on the 14th and 17th holes. On 14, Stanley tried to hack a fairway wood out of thick rough, and his ball immediately shot left, his ball two-hopping into a marshal. \u201cMy caddie yelled \u2018fore\u2019 about a second after it came off the clubface,\u201d Stanley said.\n\nThe short, blind 17th was played into a strong left-to-right wind Friday, and Stanley\u2019s ball started drifting in the breeze, toward the gallery. Stanley said that his caddie, his two playing partners and a couple of marshals all yelled. \u201cI thought that was enough,\u201d he said. \u201cThey knew it was coming. To me, it was a non-issue.\u201d\n\nMacIntyre disagreed, and he offered his playing partner some \u201charsh words\u201d in the scoring trailer afterward. Stanley said he was surprised by MacIntyre\u2019s outburst, especially since Stanley had asked those standing right of the 17th fairway if anyone had been struck and no one responded.\n\n\u201cEveryone I play with, when there\u2019s a ball off-line, there\u2019s an effort to let people know,\u201d he said. \u201cI certainly don\u2019t think guys try to, when they hit a ball off-line, use the crowd to their advantage.\u201d\n\nStanley said that he didn\u2019t apologize to MacIntyre, nor would he confront him again about the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not awkward for me,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you talk about somebody playing within the boundaries of etiquette in golf, that\u2019s kind of a touchy situation. To paint somebody in a bad light, not playing within the etiquette of the game, you\u2019ve got to be careful when you do that. When you tell your story, you\u2019ve got to make sure you have all the details.\n\n\u201cFrom what I read last night, he didn\u2019t do that. He\u2019s a young player (22). I\u2019ve been out here a while I don\u2019t feel the need to be schooled on the rules of golf or what to do when you hit a shot off-line. So that\u2019s my perspective on it.

They\u2019re also haggling over company-paid legal services for union members and the future of a joint UAW-GM training center in Detroit, the letter said.\n\nBut the company, in a Thursday letter to Dittes, said that GM expected the union to move more quickly and respond to the larger offer before the committee work is done.\n\n\u201cAt the meeting, Mary Barra emphasized the need to get a comprehensive response from the union as soon as possible,\u201d wrote Scott Sandefur, GM\u2019s top bargainer.\n\nDittes wrote that when the committees finish, the union will turn in a comprehensive proposal in response to the company\u2019s offer.\n\n\u201cThe completion of those committees is not known at this point,\u201d Dittes wrote, adding that committees have been meeting since 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nWorkers walked off their jobs on Sept. 16 after their four-year contract expired.

The Celtics had been building toward a specific goal for years, and one disastrous season ripped away their suddenly promising chances of accomplishing it. But one small silver lining: Boston\u2019s strategies around the 2019 NBA Draft are now simplified. The goal now is to improve around the timelines of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum.\n\n\u201cWe do like a lot of guys in this draft and there are scenarios when we would have three guys and keep them all,\u201d Celtics director of player personnel Austin Ainge said earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly manageable on a 15 or 17-man roster now with two-ways to have some rookies.\u201d\n\nThat might be in the cards in the wake of Saturday\u2019s news. The Celtics can employ a few different draft strategies to accomplish that goal, all of which follow some basic archetypes. Let\u2019s take a look at some of those archetypes, and which prospects would fit into the molds.\n\nThe Risk-It-All option\n\nSome players who fit in this category:\n\n- Bol Bol\n\n- Kevin Porter Jr.\n\n- Darius Bazley\n\n- Jontay Porter\n\n- Jalen Lecque\n\n- Louis King\n\nPlayers listed above are high-risk, high-reward for various reasons, including questions about injuries (Jontay Porter), motor (Bol Bol), and lack of experience (Darius Bazley, Jalen Lecque). But all of them have talent that outstrips their projected draft range by a fair amount, and one could make a strong case for each one becoming a very valuable player with good development.\n\nA reasonable example of a Risk-It-All-Draft: Bol (14), Porter (20) and Bazley (22). The Celtics pick up a potential unicorn, a powerful guard with explosive athleticism and 3-point shooting, and a potential ball-handling four whose body is starting to fill out. They also might be left with a handful of nothing, but three lottery tickets give you a better chance at hitting big than one.\n\nThe Play-It-Safe option\n\nTechnically, every draft pick is a gamble, but here are some guys who are fairly safe bets to be productive players.\n\n- P.J. Washington\n\n- Tyler Herro\n\n- Keldon Johnson\n\n- Cameron Johnson\n\n- Nickeil Alexander-Walker\n\n- Ty Jerome\n\n- Matisse Thybulle\n\n- Grant Williams\n\nEach of these prospects has a relatively high floor, which limits their bust potential. Whether they bring plenty of experience (Jerome), a knowable skill set (Washington, Thybulle, Herro, Cameron Johnson) or a high motor (Keldon Johnson), they all should be contributors at the next level.\n\nA reasonable example of a Play-It-Safe draft: Washington (14), Alexander-Walker (20), Cameron Johnson (22). With that combination, Boston would pick up a post-up big with stretch potential, a secondary play maker who can shoot from deep, and perhaps the best pure shooter in the draft.\n\nAs you can see, even these somewhat extreme examples aren\u2019t bad strategies. Going all in on risk gives the Celtics three strikes to use on the high-level talent. Having three solid role players could give Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown some support as soon as next year.\n\nBut the Celtics could also mix it up.\n\nThe Mostly-Play-It-Safe Option\n\nA reasonable example of a Mostly-Play-It-Safe draft: Herro (14), Kevin Porter Jr. (20), Cameron Johnson (22). In this instance, the Celtics get a ton of shooting and floor spacing from Herro and Johnson, but they also take a shot on star talent in Porter. Not a bad gamble, given that they gain contributors who can play immediately and also get a chance to develop a player within their culture who has top-five-in-his-class potential.\n\nThe Risk-Some-Of-It Option\n\nA reasonable example of a Risk-Some-Of-It option: Bol (14), Porter (20), Jerome (22). In this scenario, the Celtics take star potential in Bol and Porter early before slowing their roll a bit to grab a high-IQ shooter in Jerome.\n\nObviously, the degree of risk on each pick also coincides with how high it is. For example, there\u2019s more risk to drafting Bol at 14 and Cameron Johnson at 22 than there is to drafting P.J. Washington at 14 and Porter or Bazley at 22.\n\nIn my latest mock draft, which you can read here, I went with a fairly balanced version of the Risk-Some-Of-It option, grabbing Herro (14), Porter (20) and Bazley (22). In other words, the Celtics went with talent they recognize and know they need with their highest pick, then took a couple of swings for the fences later in the first round when strikes aren\u2019t quite as damaging.\n\nThe Moving-On-Up option\n\nThe Celtics aren\u2019t going to be able to package anything together to move into the top three, where the Pelicans, Memphis Grizzlies and New York Knicks are all zeroed in on their favorite players. The No. 4 pick is available, but the Celtics aren\u2019t going to be able to get it -- the Pelicans snagged it from the Lakers, and they are hoping to trade it for a talented, proven player as opposed to more packaged picks.\n\nWould the Cavaliers want to move down? Probably not, even though their roster has a lot of holes to fill. Phoenix wants Coby White. The Bulls and Hawks will likely be happy with the players who slip to them.\n\nSo how high could the Celtics move? Maybe to No. 9, where the rebuilding Washington Wizards might be able to use multiple picks instead of one slightly better one. The Hawks won\u2019t want to move for more draft picks (they have three already themselves), but perhaps Minnesota or Charlotte would want multiple bites at the apple.\n\nIn that case, some players in the middle of the lottery who might not be available at 14:\n\n- Brandon Clarke\n\n- Rui Hachimura\n\n- Jaxson Hayes\n\n- Nassir Little\n\n- Sekou Doumbouya\n\nAre those guys worth packaging picks? Probably not, especially since one might slip to 14 anyway. This option doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\n\nThe Trading-On-Out Option\n\nThe Celtics also could use a pick or two and then deal a pick (or two) for established players to fill out their roster. This might be the most realistic option, but it\u2019s also one of the most difficult to project. The player the Celtics could get for 14 is probably different than the player they could get for 22. The player they could get for 20 and 22 is probably different than the player they could get for all three picks.\n\nAs such, speculating on who they might acquire probably isn\u2019t particularly responsible. But while Boston is building with youth, don\u2019t forget that youth need veterans to thrive. The Celtics probably won\u2019t give up all of their picks, but seeing them hand out a couple for experienced players certainly seems plausible.\n\nWhat are the Celtics like?\n\nDanny Ainge is a risk taker, but he\u2019s not a wild gambler that puts all of his money on the field and lets the dice fall as they may. He doesn\u2019t mind a big swing, even if it results in a big miss.\n\nWe can\u2019t know for sure how the Celtics will draft, but a reasonable guess would be controlled risk in one way or the other. The Celtics need stars, but they also certainly hope they already have a couple in Tatum and Brown, and giving them necessary support entering next season without any training wheels would be wise.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/30593861/nfl-week-16-fantasy-football-inactives-watch-friday-saturday-out", "authors": ["Aj Mass", "Espn Fantasy Staff", "Jim Mccormick", "Kyle Soppe", "Lindsey Thiry", "Espn Fantasy"], "title": "NFL Week 16 fantasy football inactives watch for Friday and Saturday", "text": "Matthew Berry breaks down which defenses fantasy managers can grab off the waiver wire this week, including the Bears, Cardinals and Chargers.

The eight-person council consists of both online experts and Twitch creators, who have a deep understanding of the Twitch platform, its content and community, the company says.\n\n\u201cWhen developing this council we felt it was essential to include both experts who can provide an external perspective, as well as Twitch streamers who deeply understand creators\u2019 unique challenges and viewpoints,\u201d Twitch explained, in an announcement introducing the new council members. \u201cEach member of the council was carefully selected based on their familiarity with the Twitch community and their relevant personal and professional experiences.\u201d\n\nTwitch says it felt the need to create a group like this to allow communities to thrive on Twitch, particularly at a time its platform is seeing record levels of engagement. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, streaming services have seen sizable increases in usage \u2014 and Twitch has been no exception.\n\nAccording to recent data from Arsenal.gg, StreamElements\u2019 analytics partner, Twitch saw 48% month-over-month growth in hours watched between March and April, including game streams and non-gaming content combined, reaching 1.65 billion hours watched last month. Year-over-year, Twitch was up by 101% in hours watched as of April, thanks to sizable growth of Twitch\u2019s \u201cJust Chatting\u201d category of non-game content that alone climbed 138% year-over-year.\n\nTwitch confirmed some of these metrics, noting hours watched were up over 50% in the past four weeks since social distancing began. It also said that, in 2019, it was seeing an average of over 4 million unique streamers per month, totaling 10 billion hours watched.\n\nBut the growth in viewers and content means there\u2019s also a lot more to manage to keep the community safe, which is where the advisory council is meant to help.\n\nThe group will offer their input on the drafting of new policies and policy updates; the development of new products and features aimed at improving safety and moderation; the promotion of healthy streaming and \u201cwork-life balance\u201d habits; the protection of interests from marginalized groups; and the identification of emerging trends that could impact the Twitch experience.\n\nIn its announcement, Twitch introduced the new members as follows (its words):\n\nAlex Holmes Alex is Deputy CEO at non-profit The Diana Award, which is a legacy to Princess Diana\u2019s belief that young people have the power to change the world.

It\u2019s also arriving at a time when Twitch is pitching itself to advertisers, whose marketing efforts have been impacted due to the cancellations of live events and sports amid the pandemic. Advertisers, burned by YouTube in the past, are looking for brand safety.\n\nThis coronavirus pandemic has increased demand from clients who have accelerated their interest in Twitch, the company recently told The Drum in an interview. In addition, the game-streaming site can help address viewers\u2019 demand for sports content through its sports sims, and their demand for competitions to watch through esports.\n\nOn the latter front, Twitch just weeks ago launched an esports directory on its site to cater to its growing streaming audience. It also recently partnered with Comscore to bring gaming and esports stats to advertisers.\n\nThe site generated $230 million ad revenue in 2018, which increased to $300 million in 2019, according to a report by The Information. But ad rates are down in 2020 due to the pandemic. That means Twitch may gain more interest and more advertisers, but not see a significant jump in revenue to reflect that until further down the road.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.blackshoediaries.com/2019/11/17/20968460/stats-and-storylines-timely-quarterback-runs-penn-state-football-sean-clifford-will-levis", "authors": ["Nov"], "title": "Stats And Storylines: Timely Quarterback Runs", "text": "Indiana played like the 7-2 team that it was coming into Happy Valley. It took a team effort, coaches and players, to hold off a late Hoosier comeback. Journey Brown had 100 yards rushing on 21 carries and Devyn Ford added 38 on 8 carries for the Lions but it was the tough yards by the quarterbacks that put the team over the hump.\n\nLate in the first quarter with the Hoosiers leading 14-10, Sean Clifford kept the ball and ran for 38 yards and a touchdown to take a lead the would never be relinquished.\n\nAs with many long runs, there was some nice blocking downfield. Devyn Ford (28) sprinted in front of Clifford to make a key block. Had Ford not made that effort, Clifford may not have gotten to the end zone, or at the very least, would have taken a hard hit. In the end zone, Mac Hippenhammer (12) did a nice job of getting between Bryant Fitzgerald (31) and where Clifford was heading.\n\nWith great music, sometimes it isn\u2019t just about the notes you play, but the notes that you don\u2019t play. Jahan Dotson (5) made a wise decision not to make an unnecessary block, one that could have been called for a penalty.\n\nThe touchdown by Clifford capped a 31-point first quarter for both teams. Over the next two quarters, they combined for 13 points as the Lions opened up a 27-17 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nIndiana put together two long scoring drives to cut the lead to 3 with 10:45 to play. First, it was a field goal after a 14 play drive. Then an 11 play, 91-yard drive had the Lions on their heels, with a collective lump building in the throats of the 100,000 plus fans cheering inside Beaver Stadium.\n\nSean Clifford needed to guide the team down the field for some points to halt the Hoosier momentum and give the defense a chance to regroup. He led an 18 play, 75 yard drive that ended with a touchdown with under two minutes to play.\n\nAfter a first down run of 13 yards by Journey Brown on the first series of plays, Penn State faced a 3rd and 9. Clifford took the ball himself, making his first run since the 38 yard touchdown in the first quarter.\n\nA pass to Pat Freiermuth moved the sticks again to the Indiana 33. With time winding down it became clear to coach James Franklin that a field goal, to increase the lead from 3 to 6, would not be much help to his team. They were committed to what could be a game-sealing touchdown.\n\nBackup quarterback Will Levis entered the game to take the snap on 3rd and 2 from the 25. The Hoosiers stopped him a yard short. On fourth down, Rahne called Levis\u2019 number again. This time it worked out behind the strength of a great push on the right side of the offensive line.\n\nThe play moved the ball further into Indiana territory and kept the clock running. With just over 3 minutes to play, Clifford ran for 6 yards on a 3rd and 1. On 3rd and goal from the 4 he ran the ball again, this time coming up a yard short.\n\nFranklin didn\u2019t hesitate to keep the offense on the field and Ricky Rahne didn\u2019t hesitate to give his quarterback the ball one last time.\n\nThis time Clifford went right over the center for a touchdown and 10 point lead with under 2 minutes to play.\n\nIndiana made it interesting, driving 66 yards for a late field goal. Jesse Luketa recovered an onside kick with a handful of seconds on the clock. One quick kneel by Clifford ran out the remainder of the clock.\n\nStats", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://comicbook.com/gaming/2019/10/13/apex-legends-loot-patch-update/", "authors": [], "title": "Apex Legends Set to Add Much-Requested Looting Change", "text": "One of the nicer things about the development of Apex Legends, the battle royale game from developer Respawn Entertainment, is that the folks working on the video game keep a public Trello which lists of upcoming changes, current bugs, and recently resolved issues. This allows players an additional way to keep an eye on what's happening behind the scenes in addition to the usual patch notes, social media updates, and so on. Recently, a much-requested looting change has cropped up on the Trello that should make a broad swath of folks happy.\n\nSpecifically, one annoying aspect of the game for some players at the moment is how looting deathboxes -- the little crates left by players after they die -- can get complicated when taking fire. As it stands, taking damage while looting automatically drops folks out of the looting menu, but this has an unintended consequence. Because folks are so ingrained to immediately drop out of the menu themselves and start firing back, it can lead players to instead dropping right back into the menu and delaying any response.\n\nThe Trello card notes that a setting is being worked on that will seemingly allow folks to toggle this interaction on and off. For those people that prefer to automatically drop out of the menu, it'll still be there, but those that constantly find themselves struggling against it will be pleased to see the change implemented in a future patch.

While there might be some loose overlap between antifa and anarchists, antifa isn\u2019t even a group, and adherents are characterized by specific resistance to perceived neo-fascist movements.\n\nAD\n\nMeanwhile, the DHS document defines \u201canti-government extremists\u201d as motivated by \"their belief that their liberties are being taken away by the perceived unconstitutional or otherwise illegitimate actions of government officials or law enforcement.\u201d\n\nObviously, that\u2019s not antifa, either.\n\n\u201cThis document shows that the government itself does not view antifa as a significant threat in the homeland,\u201d Juliette Kayyem, a former DHS official who reviewed the document at my request, told me.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe document shows how absurd the Trump campaign\u2019s justification for using the symbol really is,\u201d Kayyem added. \u201cIt undercuts their defense.\u201d\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League has harshly criticized the Trump campaign for employing a symbol that \u201cis practically identical to that used by the Nazi regime to classify political prisoners in concentration camps.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nKayyem said the document is a bulletin customarily sent by DHS to \u201cstate and local law enforcement\u201d to alert them as to \u201cwhat they should be looking out for in terms of threats.\u201d\n\nThe document also notes that \u201coverall protest-related violence\" has been \"decreasing significantly during the last week,\u201d which also undermines continued Trump fearmongering.\n\nThe document does assess that there may be \u201cheightened\u201d threats to law enforcement in coming days in the form of \u201cexploitation of otherwise lawful protests\u201d by \u201cviolent opportunists,\" and cites \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d and \u201cblack supremacist\u201d extremists.\n\nAD\n\nNotably, the continuing threat to law enforcement has been thrust to the forefront by the arrest of Steven Carrillo for the alleged killing of one security officer and the wounding of another. Carrillo is an alleged adherent of the \u201cboogaloo boys,\u201d an extremist movement trying to exploit protests to incite race war.\n\nAD\n\nThe DHS document actually does cite the \u201cBoogaloo movement\u201d as a threat in this context. It notes that Carrillo is likely associated with it, defining it as \u201ca term used by some violent extremists from a variety of movements who seek to incite a race war or the collapse of society.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, according to CNN reporter Marshall Cohen, Trump has yet to mention this as a threat.\n\nAt the same time, the Trump campaign continues to cite antifa as a threat \u2014 and is using this to justify its use of that symbol in ads \u2014 even though an assessment from Trump\u2019s own government doesn\u2019t cast antifa as such.\n\nAD\n\nSimilarly, another leaked intelligence document earlier this month assessed the greatest threat as coming from \u201clone offenders with racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist ideologies,\u201d not from antifa.\n\nAD\n\nThe new DHS document shows that the non-assessment of the threat of antifa hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 even as the claims about antifa continue.\n\nThe broader story here, as Isaac Stanley-Becker details, is that the continued fearmongering about antifa by Trump and many top officials seems designed to distort the true nature of these multiracial, largely peaceful and broadly representative national protests in a very fundamental way.\n\nThere\u2019s another pernicious angle here, too. As another former DHS official noted, this document cites the possibility of more attacks on law enforcement \u2014 but concerted distortions of what\u2019s driving that threat are themselves destructive to efforts to combat them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAttributing the risk to one group (or mischaracterizing its structure) is dangerous, because it misses the holistic nature of the problem, excludes those that do present a danger and ultimately, puts law enforcement at increased risk,\u201d this official told me.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.androidcentral.com/movado-connect-20-launches-snapdragon-3100-and-1gb-ram-495", "authors": [], "title": "Movado Connect 2.0 launches with Snapdragon Wear 3100 and 1GB RAM for $495", "text": "What you need to know The Movado Connect 2.0 is official and you can pre-order it starting today.\n\nIt runs the latest Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, and comes in 40mm and 42mm sizes.\n\nPrices start at $495 but can reach $795 depending on the finish and band you choose.\n\nIf you were holding out hope for a Pixel Watch this year, it's pretty evident that you can give up on that.

A group of players led by Kyrie Irving is concerned the returning to basketball will distract from the growing social justice movement, and the coronavirus pandemic continues to worsen in Florida.\n\nEarly on Monday morning, Washington Wizards forward Davis Bertans, who was in the midst of a career season, and is set to be a free agent, opted out of the remainder of the season. Now, Portland Trail Blazers forward Trevor Ariza has joined him as the latest player to decide to sit out, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.\n\nAriza's reasoning is much different from Bertans, however, as he is choosing to spend the time with his son.\n\nAriza, a starter, has been involved in a custody case over his 12-year old son, and the mother's choice of granting a court-ordered one month visitation period during the league's quarantine of teams in Orlando left Ariza to choose those parenting responsibilities over competing with the Blazers in the 22-team re-start, sources said. Ariza, 34, could lose between $1 million and $1.8 million in salary, based on whether the Blazers qualify for the playoffs, for not participating in the restart. Ariza has a minimally-guaranteed $12.8 million contract for the 2020-2021 season.\n\nDue to the league's health and safety protocols, Ariza could unfortunately not bring his son with him to Orlando. According to a document obtained by CBS Sports, no player guests will be allowed until after the first round of the playoffs. This left Ariza to decide between parenting or playing. Unsurprisingly, he chose to be a parent.\n\nThe veteran forward was traded from the Sacramento Kings to the Blazers in January in a deal that involved Kent Bazemore and Anthony Tolliver. In 21 games with the Blazers, he was averaging 11 points and 4.8 rebounds, while shooting an impressive 40 percent from 3-point land. He figured to be a key part of their rotation heading into Orlando, as they'll compete for a playoff spot in the Western Conference.\n\nPlayers who wish to opt-out of the bubble environment have until June 24 to notify their teams.

And could it involve some specific packages for true freshman Luke McCaffrey to assist Noah Vedral if Adrian Martinez can\u2019t go? I feel like the QB run game, along with some tough yards by Dedrick Mill, needs to be a threat. Given what we\u2019ve heard about McCaffrey\u2019s speed and his cool demeanor, it feels like a game where you don\u2019t hesitate to see if that can make some hay. Meanwhile, Vedral will need to play with that decisive confidence that he sees as one of his strengths.\n\nCan Maurice Washington be a dynamic X factor for a full game to add some explosive play help to Wan\u2019Dale Robinson and maybe JD Spielman? (I actually have some optimism Spielman might make a go of it in his home state). The Huskers need the Washington we saw back in Colorado, who can deliver those two or three breakout plays to jump start this offense. Given Nebraska\u2019s struggles to finish off drives (ranked 123rd in red zone offense) and the kicking concerns, this team could need one or two long-distance jobs for scores. Washington is still as talented any player on the field. Challenged by coaches this week, he needs to re-emerge.\n\nPick to Click: Dicaprio Bootle. The Husker junior cornerback has had a really strong season and opponents have been hesitant to test him. If he can help negate either Tyler Johnson or Rashod Bateman the way he did with Colorado\u2019s Laviska Shenault, it will be a major piece in the Blackshirts trying to lock down a win.\n\nPrediction: Minnesota 30, Nebraska 22. Injury worries and inconsistencies on the O-line limit my confidence in how the Huskers will slug it out on a bad-weather night. But make no mistake a win would be a major swing game for this team, and in my mind, the most important win by a Nebraska team in the Scott Frost tenure.\n\nMichael Bruntz\n\nThe weather will likely take center stage on Saturday night in the Twin Cities. Cold temperatures, high winds and precipitation are expected, and which team deals with those realities the best will likely come out on top. Will Nebraska be able to run its full offense knowing that winds will make passing difficult and the fumble-prone Huskers could have difficulty on exchanges. One factor working in the Huskers\u2019 favor is that a big play or two could turn a game like Saturday\u2019s, and Nebraska has shown its ability to make a few of those, rather than stringing together lengthy drives.\n\nNebraska\u2019s defense should come to Minneapolis confident after helping to close out last week\u2019s win over Northwestern. A different challenge awaits in Minnesota, however. The Golden Gophers ran through Illinois for more than 300 yards last week, and have the size up front to try to get downhill against the Huskers. Nebraska\u2019s outside linebackers will need to hold the edge against Minnesota\u2019s tight ends and try to force Minnesota quarterback Tanner Morgan into making throws on third and long.\n\nPick to Click: Dedrick Mills. It feels like an old-school Big Ten football kind of game, and Mills will need to be a workhorse for the Huskers.\n\nPrediction: Nebraska 22 Minnesota 19. Let\u2019s get weird.\n\nMike Schaefer\n\nNebraska and Minnesota are meeting on a cold, blustery day and the Huskers are a hurting team with the status of quarterback Adrian Martinez, wide receiver JD Spielman, and whoever the hell is lining up at kicker currently unknown. This all seems to point to a conservative, ball control, power offense on Saturday. Let Dedrick Mills attempt to eat, then bust Maurice Washington and Wan\u2019Dale Robinson outside. That\u2019s where Minnesota is vulnerable and could yield the home run play. Give Noah Vedral some help and the Huskers can make this thing a game.\n\nDefensively Nebraska has to make Tanner Morgan work for everything on Saturday. Minnesota will want to run to set up the play action passing game, and if the Huskers are strong up front, which it has been at times this season, then it will make Morgan have to live in second and third and long. Morgan has been better than expected, but has taken advantage of some good chain play calling where the defense is looking run and he\u2019s catching wide open receivers. Nebraska can\u2019t afford that on Saturday.\n\nPick to click: Dedrick Mills goes for more than 100 yards on Saturday and the Huskers ride the powerful runner between the trenches to shorten the game and wear down the Gophers.\n\nPrediction: Minnesota 20, Nebraska 16.

And 47% agreed that the idea of going to a major public event \u201cwill scare me for a long time.\u201d\n\nThe study was published by Performance Research, a sports and events research firm, in partnership with Full Circle Research Co.\n\nThe news for movie theaters was particularly grim, with 49% of respondents saying it would take a few months to never for them to return, and 28% saying that they will attend movie theaters less often once they\u2019re safe. While 15% of respondents said they plan on going to the movies more often post-pandemic (and 58% said their attendance won\u2019t change), the net effect suggests an alarming erosion of theatrical returns that theater exhibitors and studios alike can ill afford.\n\nMajor indoor concert venues, indoor sports venues, and \u2014 of significant interest to the Walt Disney Company \u2014 theme parks appear to be the hardest hit by the pandemic, with 56%, 51% and 50% of respondents respectively saying it would take anywhere from a few months to possibly never for them to return, even after they\u2019ve been deemed safe. A third of respondents further said they plan to attend indoor sports venues and indoor concert venues less often after the COVID-19 epidemic has subsided.\n\nOutdoor parks and beaches, outdoor sports venues, and zoos and aquariums appear to be the least affected, with 64%, 56%, and 55% of respondents respectively saying they would return right away or within a few weeks.\n\nEven for those who do say they will return to public venues, however, the possibility of catching a pathogen will be front of mind: Two-thirds of respondents said their concern over the cleanliness and sanitation of venues and restrooms will be higher than prior to the pandemic; 65% stated concern for the cleanliness of food service areas; and 59% said they will be concerned about crowds and their general proximity to strangers.\n\nThe news isn\u2019t entirely bad, however: 46% said they will value going to public events more than they did before, and 53% reported a \u201cpent-up desire to attend the events I love\u201d once the pandemic is over.\n\nA vast majority of respondents \u2014 66% \u2014 said the decision by major sports organizations to suspend public events was \u201cabout right.\u201d\n\nThe study, which has a margin of error of 3%, drew from consumers in Full Circle\u2019s research panel, who were surveyed between March 23 to 26 \u2014 when the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. nearly doubled from 43,667 to 83,836.

All of their phones were bombarded with text messages asking similar questions. \u201cHave you seen this?\u201d \u201cAre you OK with this?\u201d \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\nHours earlier, team general manager Connie May tweeted out a photo of the team\u2019s players lined up for the national anthem. May tagged President Donald Trump in the tweet, making sure to let him know the picture featured, \u201cEveryone respecting the FLAG!\u201d The tweet was eventually deleted.\n\nThe players \u2014 many of whom will represent the United States in the Tokyo Olympics next year \u2014 were furious. They felt as though their voices were taken away, and that they were used to make a political statement that they didn\u2019t support. In the ultimate move of solidarity, the entire team, its coaches and some staff members vowed to never play for the Scrap Yard Dawgs again.\n\nThe players may have left the Scrap Yard Dawgs behind, but had no intention of walking away from softball, especially after what happened. So they did the next best thing: They started their own team.\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing, athletes have banded together to use their platform to enact change within their sport. NFL players and employees got commissioner Roger Goodell to say \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d and allow sideline protests after years of discouraging that behavior. The University of Cincinnati said it would remove Marge Schott\u2019s name from its baseball stadium after athletes spoke up. This was professional softball\u2019s moment.\n\nOn Friday, the former members of the Scrap Yard Dawgs started This Is Us Softball. It\u2019s the same roster and coaches that made up the Scrap Yard Dawgs, but with a much different message.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really the same team, we\u2019re just dropping the Scrap Yard portion of it because we no longer want to represent the organization after how we were treated,\u201d outfielder Haylie McCleney told Yahoo Sports. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to continue to play for the awareness, the empowerment and the unity.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe players explained how they intend to uphold those values in a video released Friday. The video features players from This Is Us explaining exactly what their new team is all about.\n\nLeaving the Scrap Yard Dawgs behind was the obvious choice. May attempted to explain the tweet in the locker room following the game, saying she believed it showed the team was unified. Some members of the team thought the apology was tone-deaf.\n\nPitcher Cat Osterman was one of the first players to declare she was done with the team, as was Kiki Stokes \u2014 the team\u2019s first-ever draft pick. Stokes was one of the two Black players on the roster, along with Kelsey Stewart. The entire team followed after that.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a question,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cNo one questioned the decision. I believe Cat was one of the first people to say it, and then after that, everyone was like, \u2018You go, I go,\u2019 and then everyone obviously supports Kiki Stokes and myself.\u201d\n\nMay attempted to apologize over the phone, but that only made things worse. At one point during the call, May apologized and then used the phrase \u201call lives matter.\u201d That let the players know she wasn\u2019t listening to their concerns.\n\n\u201cI was on the call,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cAnd she was apologizing and she kept saying, \u2018But my heart was in a good place.\u2019 She went as far as to apologize and then say \u2018all lives matter,\u2019 At that point, people were like, she\u2019s really not understanding what we\u2019re trying to say.\u201d\n\nMcCleney says she heard May used the phrase, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but \u2026\u201d numerous times during the call. McCleney says players felt there was \u201cno genuineness\u201d in May\u2019s apology. McCleney adds she\u2019s disappointed May hasn\u2019t made a public statement on the matter.\n\nThe players\u2019 biggest public statement came Friday. With the creation of This Is Us, the players declared they weren\u2019t going to stay silent. They wanted to use their platforms to make a change.\n\n\u201cNot just in the softball community but in this country,\u201d says McCleney.\n\nMultiple companies reached out to the team to help secure funding and equipment. The USSSA Pride, the team the Scrap Yard Dawgs played against Monday, also offered their full support to the players, coaches and staff that left the organization. The Pride \u2014 who were set to play a seven-game series against the Scrap Yard Dawgs during the summer \u2014 condemned May\u2019s tweet publicly, and postponed games as a show of solidarity after what happened Monday.\n\n\u201cThe Pride is 100 percent behind us,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cThey support everything we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nBy starting This Is Us, both McCleney and Stewart hope meaningful conversations about racism can take place. McCleney urges people to listen to Black voices, saying, \u201cIf our GM was listening to Black voices, she would have known that that tweet was unacceptable.\u201d\n\nStewart believes those conversations are necessary for people to change their minds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to open our hearts and minds and really acknowledge the situation, acknowledge that racism is real and be part of that change,\u201d she says. \u201cHave those hard conversations and don\u2019t be afraid to change your mind after you learn new information.\u201d\n\nFor Stewart, one of the most discouraging side effects from Monday\u2019s tweet is the number of young girls who have told Stewart they no longer feel like playing softball. Stewart wants them to know she \u2014 and the rest of This Is Us \u2014 is fighting for them.\n\n\u201cWe are here to protect you at all costs. And we\u2019re going through this now so you don\u2019t have to go through this,\u201d she says. \u201cKeep swinging, keep playing catch and we\u2019ll protect you the whole way.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/j-lo-super-bowl-halftime-show-preparation", "authors": ["Melissa Roberto"], "title": "How JLo is preparing for Super Bowl LIV halftime show", "text": "Jennifer Lopez cannot contain her excitement for her upcoming Super Bowl LIV halftime show performance.

European Union leaders meet for a year-end summit that will address anything from climate, sanctions against Turkey to budget and virus recovery plans. Brexit will be discussed on the sidelines. (AP Photo/Francisco Seco)\n\nBRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 European Union leaders reached a hard-fought deal Friday to cut the bloc\u2019s net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared with 1990 levels, avoiding a hugely embarrassing deadlock ahead of a U.N. climate meeting this weekend.\n\nFollowing night-long discussions at their two-day summit in Brussels, the 27 member states approved the EU executive commission\u2019s proposal to toughen the bloc\u2019s intermediate target on the way to climate neutrality by mid-century, after a group of reluctant, coal-reliant countries finally agreed to support the improved goal.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cEurope is the leader in the fight against climate change,\u201d tweeted EU Council president Charles Michel as daylight broke over the EU capital city. \u201cWe decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55% by 2030.\u201d\n\nFive years after the Paris agreement, the EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. Yet the bloc\u2019s heads of state and government were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns by eastern nations seeking more clarity about how to fund and handle the green transition.\n\nBut the long-awaited deal on a massive long-term budget and coronavirus recovery clinched Thursday by EU leaders swung the momentum.\n\nLarge swaths of the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation. EU leaders have agreed that 30% of the package should be used to support the transition.\n\nStill, agreeing on common language was not an easy task. Negotiations were punctuated throughout the night by intense discussions in the plenary session and multiple chats in smaller groups on the sidelines.\n\nAnother delay in revising the EU\u2019s current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would have been particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal, and leaders worked to the wire to seal a deal.\n\nThe event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the U.K. with the United Nations and France. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the U.K. to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 \u2014 a more ambitious goal than the EU\u2019s.\n\nPoland, which last year didn\u2019t commit to the EU\u2019s 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for their energy needs. They considered it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without considering their respective energy mixes.\n\nTo win their approval, member states agreed that the new target should be delivered collectively. According to the Belgian Prime minister\u2019s office, \u201cleaders agreed that the cuts will be first achieved in sectors and countries where there is still plenty of room for improvement.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the European Commission will take into account specific national situations when drawing up the measures. A progress report will be submitted to the European Council in the spring.\n\nThe accord also left the door open to member states to use gas or nuclear power as they drop fossil fuels. EU leaders agreed last year that nuclear energy would be part of the bloc\u2019s solution to making its economy carbon neutral, and they reiterated Friday that they would respect member states\u2019 rights to decide on their energy mix and to choose the most appropriate technologies to reach the goal.\n\nAccording to a French official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the meeting, Poland also obtained guarantees that the EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System \u2014 a cap-and-trade scheme for industries to buy carbon credits covering about 40% of the EU\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 would be revamped. Poland wants the reform of the system to redirect more revenues to the poorer EU countries.\n\nWorld leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.\n\nGreenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.\n\n\u201cTo increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5\u00b0C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65% cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,\u201d the NGO said.\n\nClimate Action Network Europe regretted that the revised \u201cnet\u201d target includes carbon sinks like reforestation, meaning that emitting sectors will need to decarbonize less to reach the new goal.\n\n\u201cAs the Commission indicates itself in its 2030 Climate Target Plan, if the EU is successful in implementing the Commission\u2019s biodiversity, carbon removals could represent up to 5% of emissions. In this case the real emissions reduction target would be as low as 50%,\u201d the NGO said.\n\nEU leaders also encouraged the commission to propose a carbon tax at the bloc\u2019s borders for countries that did do not regulate CO2 emissions as strictly as the EU does.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s climate coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/climate", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/raiders-reportedly-trade-former-first-round-pick-gareon-conley-to-the-texans-for-draft-pick/", "authors": ["Josh Edwards"], "title": "Raiders reportedly trade former first-round pick Gareon Conley to the Texans for draft pick", "text": "The Oakland Raiders have traded cornerback Gareon Conley to the Houston Texans in exchange for a third-round pick, according to Vic Tafur of The Athletic. NFL Media's Ian Rapoport clarified that the Raiders are acquiring the third-round pick that Houston received from Seattle as part of the Jadeveon Clowney trade.\n\nConley is under contractual control through the 2020 NFL season and potentially longer if the Texans elect to pick up his fifth-year option. The No. 24 overall selection in the 2017 NFL Draft has recorded 23 tackles, two pass deflections and an interception this season. In his prior 17 career games, he had amassed 44 tackles, three interceptions, 16 pass deflections and a touchdown.\n\nTexans head coach Bill O'Brien has played a prominent role in personnel moves since the organization's decision to part ways with former general manager Brian Gaine. The 4-3 Texans must feel that they are just a few pieces away from being a Super Bowl contender because they have gone all-in with trades. They spent a 2019 second-round pick on Kentucky cornerback Lonnie Johnson.\n\nHouston owes the Browns their third-round pick in the 2020 NFL Draft if running back Duke Johnson Jr. is active for 10-plus games; he has already played in each of their first seven games. The other pick is now promised to Oakland. Houston had already traded their 2020 first-round pick, 2021 first-round pick and 2021 second-round pick to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for left tackle Laremy Tunsil, so they are bereft of draft capital for a few years. The AFC South franchise does have an additional fourth-round pick as part of the Tunsil deal, but they dealt a sixth-round pick to the Patriots for Keion Crossen.\n\nThe Raiders are 3-3 and still in the heart of the AFC Playoff race. General Manager Mike Mayock must have felt that the return was too great to pass up. The trade likely means that Keisean Nixon, Nevin Lawson or Trayvon Mullen will step into that starting role opposite Daryl Worley.\n\nGruden has an additional 2020 first-round pick and 2020 third-round pick to complete the Khalil Mack trade. Their second-round pick goes to Chicago in return. On the first two days of the 2020 NFL Draft, they will have two first-round picks and three third-round picks.\n\nA bow can now be tied on the Clowney trade as well.

In preparation for court action, the committee on Wednesday told the White House in a letter that it rejected immunity claims that prompted one former Trump aide to refuse to answer more than 200 questions.\n\nThe panel gave White House officials until July 17 to produce a revised list of objections.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Democrats, who are poised to expand their probe of Trump, his family and associates with a slew of new subpoenas, say Mueller\u2019s testimony will focus public attention on some of the more disturbing findings of his two-year investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn a 448-page report, Mueller said the Trump campaign had numerous contacts with Moscow, though the investigation did not find sufficient evidence to show conspiracy.\n\nHe did not conclude that Trump obstructed justice by trying to impede the Russia probe, but also did not exonerate the president of doing so.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is also investigating alleged hush payments during the 2016 campaign to two women who claimed to have affairs with Trump, including porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\n\u201cThe Dems Witch Hunt continues!\u201d Trump said in a tweet on Wednesday. He has regularly denounced the Mueller investigation while also claiming that the probe found \u201cno collusion\u201d with Russia and \u201cno obstruction.\u201d\n\nJudiciary Committee Democrats privately met on Wednesday to discuss details of conducting the Mueller hearing and his aides\u2019 testimony. Lawmakers emerging from the session said arrangement were still in flux.\n\nMueller, in his first public comments since starting his investigation, said on May 29 that Justice Department policies meant the probe was never going to end with criminal charges against Trump, and indicated it was up to Congress to decide whether he should be impeached.\n\n\u201cIf we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\u201d Mueller said.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/22/best-black-friday-apple-deals-2/", "authors": [], "title": "Black Friday Apple Deals: Save on iPad, MacBook, Apple Watch", "text": "Welcome to Black Friday week at 9to5Mac.

While at SMU, Morris watched Hicks rewrite the record books for quarterbacks. So when Morris came to Arkansas, the idea of getting Hicks to transfer sure figured to be a sound one.\n\nBut the things Hicks did at SMU didn\u2019t translate to SEC football, and maybe Morris\u2019 system doesn\u2019t either.

As a backup or emergency quarterback, Starkel has a role on this roster.\n\nIn their 54-24 loss to Mississippi State last Saturday, we saw 2 young quarterbacks come off the bench and do good things. Granted that while both excelled in mop-up roles, the potential was on display from both John Stephen Jones and K.J. Jefferson.\n\nFor Jones, grandson of Jerry Jones, former Arkansas player and owner of the Dallas Cowboys, it was his second such outing. Jones completed 6-of-7 passes for 49 yards and a touchdown the week before in a blowout loss to Alabama.\n\nThough his numbers were less impressive on Saturday (4-for-9, 25 yards, 1 TD) they were still somehow good enough for Morris to announce him as the starting quarterback for the game this week against Western Kentucky.\n\nOK, I get it, the transfers have not worked out and at 2-7 what is there to lose by starting the redshirt freshman? Some might even say it\u2019s long overdue. But why Jones? Because his family is loaded, and I don\u2019t mean with athletic ability?\n\nJefferson is clearly the better talent. The true freshman excited not only the football team Saturday but also had the full support of a Homecoming game crowd, what was left of it. Jefferson sparked the offense in a way that hasn\u2019t been seen all season.\n\nAgain, it was accomplished in garbage time, but Jefferson led his team on an impressive touchdown drive that not only showed his abilities as a passer, but perhaps even more encouraging his capabilities as a runner. Jefferson completed a 32-yard pass and then ran for 26 yards and a touchdown. He was 1 of 6 true freshmen on the field for Arkansas during the touchdown drive.\n\nHe has the full package and at 6-3, 228 pounds, Jefferson is a much more imposing figure than the 5-11, 199-pound Jones. It\u2019s really no contest which quarterback presents a brighter future for the Razorbacks. And if you\u2019re going to turn to the younger players for the final 3 games of the season, why wouldn\u2019t you choose Jefferson?\n\nJoe Craddock, in Year 2 as the offensive coordinator, said Monday that while Jones will start, Jefferson would take snaps, and earlier rather than later.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to see him earlier,\u201d said Craddock, who added that the coaching staff would evaluate which of the two QBs moves the ball better and allot playing time accordingly.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the intangibles in which Jones has the edge over Jefferson? Maybe he knows the offense better? Who knows. Craddock said the bye week helped immensely in that Jefferson was afforded a good portion of the reps in practice.\n\nMy hope is that Morris can figure it out and hand the reins to Jefferson and not give the impression that big boosters are making key decisions.\n\nBut that\u2019s where we are today in the big-business of college football.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://seekingalpha.com/article/4307442-fate-big-3-canadian-cannabis-producers", "authors": ["Gary Bourgeault"], "title": "Fate Of The Big 3 Canadian Cannabis Producers", "text": "Source: investment hustler\n\nTo say the performance of Aurora Cannabis (ACB), Canopy Growth (CGC) and Aphria (APHA) were underwhelming over the last couple of quarters would be an understatement. They have been terrible.\n\nThe top three Canadian cannabis companies as measured by production capacity, are bellwethers of the health of the cannabis industry, and by that metric, it appears that there are some big problems the sector is now facing.\n\nWhile that's true, what's important to take into account is the impact the dismal performance of Health Canada has had on the companies in regard to unsuccessfully licensing enough retail outlets in order for the suppliers to ramp up sales. All the companies have pointed to that as being the key factor in a decline in recreational pot sales.\n\nEven though it could be taken as an excuse for the weak performances, my belief is that they aren't really trying to do that in this case. The biggest failure has been in Toronto, and Ontario as a whole, where not that long ago there were only a handful of retail stores customers could buy legal pot at.\n\nIn this article we'll look at the consequences of the lack of Canadian retail stores, and what it means for these three producers in the short and long term.\n\nLicensing failure and the black market\n\nIn my view there should be hundreds more physical locations in Canada than there are now for consumers to acquire legal cannabis. There is no doubt these three companies, and others as well, had been counting on that to be the case over a year after the legalization of recreational pot in Canada.\n\nWhen considering many of the Canadian producers had built their facilities at a pace that would closely align with the legalization of derivatives in October 2019 - once they were close to full capacity - it has not allowed the increase in production capacity to have the impact on their revenue, margins and earnings, as they otherwise would have.\n\nAll three of these companies are not that far away from having their facilities in Canada reach their overall production potential, and others such as Organigram are close as well.\n\nThe reason they worked to get production capacity to reach high levels in this period of time and the near future, was because they assumed the number of retail stores would be much higher at this time than they are.\n\nConsequently, the result is an erosion of revenue, as there simply aren't enough places to sell their increasing amount of supply out of.\n\nContrary to what some have suggested, there isn't the oversupply issue that is being pointed out as being the cause of the decline in revenue, but the lack of legal stores to sell cannabis from.\n\nThat in turn has allowed the black market to continue to thrive, primarily because they are the only option for many people. This has also suppressed the potential growth of the consumer bases of these companies because many of the customers will be trying cannabis for the first time because of it being legal. They aren't interested in the risk of buying from the black market.\n\nThe issue here has very little to do with there being too much supply in the market in comparison to demand, the issue is there being too much legal supply in a market that has heavy demand, but doesn't have enough legal physical stores to meet that demand.\n\nTo put it another way, cannabis demand -both legal and illegal - is still huge, legal suppliers simply haven't been able to get their supply to the market at levels they are currently able to.\n\nThis is amplified by the fact the largest market in Canada has so few stores to serve the millions of potential consumers in Ontario. All these companies can do is wait it out because they have no control over the process and its pace.\n\nI'm starting to get more concerned than before because I also built into my models for these companies a much higher number of retail stores at this time. It doesn't seem Health Canada has a sense of urgency in the matter as well.\n\nThe big thing to takeaway from this is investors in these and other Canadian cannabis companies must include the lack of retail outlets in their models, as it's the biggest factor in the growth trajectory of Canadian cannabis companies, and until the number of stores increase significantly in number, revenue is going to remain subdued.\n\nAnother concern is with the lack of retail cannabis outlets, which will likely result in disappointing numbers from derivative sales. That doesn't mean it won't boost revenue and earnings for these companies, but it does mean it may be far less than originally anticipated in the near term.\n\nWith that in mind, Aurora Cannabis, Canopy Growth and Aphria do have different strengths and weaknesses within the fundamentals that need to be taken into account in relationship to these market conditions, which is what we'll get into next.\n\nAphria\n\nAphria, like many cannabis companies, has experienced a lot of pros and cons concerning sentiment from investors. Some investors that are looking for earnings have been positive on the company lately, after a couple of decent quarters showing a profit.\n\nIn the latest quarter the company reported net revenue of C$126.1 million, with earnings for the reporting period coming in at C$16.4 million, beating the C$15.8 million generated in the prior quarter. Year-over-year earnings was down from the C$21.1 million reported in the first fiscal quarter of 2018.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1 million, with adjusted EBITDA from cannabis operations ending at $1.3 million. Taking away gains from outside of operations, net income in the quarter fell from a gain of C$16.4 million to a loss of C$30 million. That means non-operational earnings accounted for the earnings in the quarter, including an increase in the value of its biological assets.\n\nAphria maintains its full year 2020 guidance of $650 t0 $700 million in revenue and $88 to $95 million in adjusted EBITDA. It will have to have a lot of things go right for it to achieve those results.\n\nCanopy Growth\n\nCanopy Growth has fallen off its perch as the representative of the cannabis sector after the firing of co-CEO Bruce Linton. It has struggled to recover from that event, and as the pace of growth of the Canadian cannabis industry slows down, it has crushed the share price of the company.\n\nIn the latest quarter it had a loss of C$374.6 million ($282.4 million), or C$1.08 per share. Compared to the same quarter in 2018, the losses were higher than the C$330.6 million loss, or C$1.52 a share the company posted.\n\nThe key negative catalyst was the restructuring charge of C$32.7 million it took from its softgel & oil products. The company obviously missed it concerning demand for oil products in particular. It also took a C$15.9 million inventory charge in the reporting period.\n\nAlthough CEO Mark Zekulin said he sees the quarter as being a one-off performance, I think that is unlikely. I see there being more charges associated to returns, inventory, and packaging in the quarters ahead. That will come from production levels against the ability to sell its product. The age and quality of the pot is the major issue there.\n\nZekulin said this: The last two quarters have been challenging for the Canadian cannabis sector as provinces have reduced purchases to lower inventory levels, retail store openings have fallen short of expectations, and Cannabis 2.0 products are yet to come to market.\n\nHe also rightly noted that Ontario, which represents approximately 40 percent of the population of Canada, only has about one store per 600,000 people. Not much going to change until that is addressed. That is the key metric to watch to get a sense of the growth trajectory in the future. The major point to understand in regard to supply and demand in Canada is that this isn't a question of demand at all, but of the shortage of retail outlets to sell product in. The demand is there, and Canopy Growth and the other companies operating in Canada built out production capacity based upon the assumption there would be many more stores that were operational at this time.\n\nCommentators continually frame this as an oversupply issue in the sense that Canopy and the others mentioned in this article have produced too much pot in relationship to demand, when in reality this is an issue of the demand being there, but the companies not having enough retail stores to meet legal demand. This is why the black market in Canada continues to flourish beyond what it should at this time.\n\nThe point is it's not as if all these companies missed on the demand potential in Canada, they missed on assessing how long it would take for retail stores to be licensed and operational.\n\nCanopy Growth isn't close to being out of the woods yet, and it has the CEO situation continuing to hang over it. Until the company hires a new CEO and the market gets more visibility on what changes will be implemented in a post-Linton era, it will continue to be a headwind.\n\nAurora Cannabis\n\nAs expected, the earnings report from Aurora Cannabis for its first fiscal quarter was underwhelming. It posted net revenue of C$75.2 million in the quarter, a 24 percent drop sequentially. Most of that came from the 33 percent decline in revenue from the Canadian recreational pot.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was also disappointing in the quarter, as it plummeted to C$39.7 million, down from the adjusted EBITDA loss of C$26.6 million in the prior quarter.\n\nAlso generating weak net revenue was its wholesale business, which fell to C$10.3 million, a decline of 49 percent. This wasn't a surprise because of retail sales were down, it's obvious it would lower demand for wholesale product.\n\nThe one bright spot on the sales side was its increase in medical sales to $30.5 million, a gain of 3 percent sequentially. Another impressive accomplishment was it cutting costs per gram to only C$0.85. That's is going to pay off for the company in the long term. I expect it to drop further in the quarters ahead.\n\nTo combat the short-term decline in revenue, Aurora announced it was suspending construction on its Aurora Nordic 2 facility and its Aurora Sun facility. The company estimates this should save about CA$190 million in capital expenditures.\n\nIt also has offered a deal to holders of concerning its convertible debentures that mature in March 2020, which will keep it from having to raise CA$230 million in capital. It'll have to raise some capital, but it won't be near the amount it would have had to under initial agreements. Investors have agreed to convert the debentures earlier and at a reduced price.\n\nI remain very bullish on Aurora Cannabis over the long term. At these prices it would be wise for those wanting cannabis exposure to start building positions in Aurora.\n\nConclusion\n\nAurora, Canopy and Aphria are all victims of the slow roll out of retail stores in Canada. This isn't just an excuse they're making for under performance, but a reality based upon the strategies they used concerning increasing production capacity.\n\nThis has kept these and other companies from scaling further and not only increasing revenue, but scaling to a level where it would reduce costs and bring them closer to profitability.\n\nThe lack of retail stores not only limits growth from existing cannabis users, but it also limits the growth potential that will come with the legalization of cannabis in Canada that will attract new customers. Many new users aren't going to go to the black market for sales, so when there are enough retail outlets to take share from the illegal market - which means long-term cannabis users - combined with a group of new users that aren't going to risk buying from the illicit market, it will significantly increase revenue in the quarters ahead.\n\nAs the black market starts to lose significant share, it'll also remove some of the cost pressures on legal operators because illegal producers and sellers don't have the additional regulations, fees and taxes the legal market has to pay for, which pushes up costs and prices.\n\nFor some time I've been saying the way to measure the performance potential of Canadian cannabis companies at the macro level is to follow the pace of the licensing and opening of new retail stores, and look closely at the impact of derivative sales have on the companies over the first two quarters of calendar 2020.\n\nThe question lingering over the fate of these three companies and others is this: will the pace of cannabis retail store openings remain incremental, or will they start to take off at a rapid pace. The answer to that question will determine the short-term performance of these companies.\n\nIt should be understood that absolutely nothing has changed at the fundamental level for the cannabis sector. It's going to continue to grow in demand for at least a decade in my opinion, as nations start to open up their markets to medical cannabis in particular, and in some cases, to recreational pot.\n\nThese countries aren't going to allow their regional competitors increase tax revenue and GDP at their expense, making them less attractive to outside investors. Aurora, Canopy and Aphria should all do well in the long term, but I still believe Aurora will outperform them and many others in the years ahead. That's primarily because of its superior management team, assuming it remains in place.\n\nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Credit: Pantone\n\nIt was a decision that echoed the company's first Color of the Year: 2000's Cerulean, chosen ahead of the new millennium when fears over the Y2K computer bug dominated the news.\n\n\"It was an interesting dichotomy of feeling,\" said Eiseman. \"It was the fear of what might happen. So (it was chosen) to help alleviate that fear. But the blue sky denotes that there's a future out there ... there's something to look forward to. So it was a very thoughtful choice from the beginning.\"\n\nPast colors have sometimes been a bit more blatant in their correlation to current events. Take 2019's energetic Living Coral, for instance, which highlighted the beauty of the ocean's microorganisms, but also warned of its disappearance, as warming oceans due to climate change have bleached coral populations. In late 2016, following the U.S. presidential election, Pantone selected Greenery for the following year, alluding to political turmoil and calling the color a hue for restoration and renewal.\n\n\"Our goal is to engage people in a conversation around color,\" said Pressman. \"It has to be organic. It has to be truthful to what's taking place.\"\n\nThough Pantone is known for its color forecasting and trend reports, Pressman said the Color of the Year is not driven by data. \"What are we looking for? What do we need? And what are the psychological characteristics of that color that can give us what we're looking for?\" Pressman posed. The decision is informed not only by the state of the world, but also what's happening in the fashion and art spheres. But this year, she said, \"you can't get away from the overwhelming influence of the pandemic.\"\n\nPsychological associations\n\nAccording to Pantone's press statement, Illuminating is associated with optimism and vivacity, while Ultimate Gray encourages \"feelings of composure, steadiness and resilience.\"\n\nIn her own research into color associations, Eiseman has found that yellow is often associated with \"cheer\" and \"happiness,\" due to its correlation with the sun.\n\nA small peer-reviewed study from 2019, led by Swiss psychologist Domicele Jonauskaite, came to a similar conclusion. The study used music and images to induce particular moods in its 125 subjects, then asked them to choose colors to match their moods. Participants most often associated the color yellow with joy.\n\nStudies have found that the color yellow is most often associated with joy, while gray can be a bit more moody. Credit: Pantone Color Institute\n\nIn 2020, Jonauskaite and her team conducted a larger international study online of color-emotion pairings to see if differences in nationality or language influenced associations. Out of nearly 4,600 participants across 30 nations, most chose yellow for joy.\n\nPantone's selection for Ultimate Gray, however, is a bit more complicated. Though it was selected for its qualities of fortitude and reliability -- it's the color of stone, and a classic neutral in a wardrobe -- according to Jonauskaite's research, gray is linked with negative moods like sadness, fear and disappointment.In a year marked by mass illness and economic anxiety, such a selection isn't off base. But Pressman thinks gray can be a bit more versatile and open to interpretation. She and Eiseman point out it's a mid-gray, not a \"heavy\" shade.\n\nHowever people interpret Pantone's choices this year, Pressman and Eiseman emphasize the strength of bringing two disparate colors together.\n\n\"What we were trying to demonstrate was how you have different elements that come together, and it's that coming together that expresses the strength and the hopefulness,\" said Eiseman.\n\n\"I think (one) thing that's become abundantly clear during this time...across the world is this deeper understanding of how much we need each other,\" said Pressman. \"How our connections to other people, our relationships with other people, give us that emotional support.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-games-sale-bioshock-collection-early-black-friday-amazon-walmart-154254202.html", "authors": [], "title": "'BioShock Collection' and other Switch games get big discounts at Amazon", "text": "Buy Animal Crossing at Amazon - $50 Buy Animal Crossing at Walmart - $50\n\nBuy Pro Controller at Amazon - $59 Buy Pro Controller at Walmart - $59\n\nIn addition to BioShock, you can get Animal Crossing: New Horizons for an all-time-low price of $50, too.

Commissioner Gary Bettman told ESPN's Get Up last week that he believed that, under the current circumstances, the league can \"go later than we've ever gone.\"\n\n\"How late is a good question,\" Bettman said. \"What we want to make sure of is that we don't do anything from this season that might impact next season and having the normalcy it is supposed to have.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-message-to-us-catholics-on-racism-and-donald-trump-after-killing-of-george-floyd/", "authors": [], "title": "Pope Francis' message to U.S. Catholics after the killing of George Floyd", "text": "Vatican City \u2014 Pope Francis called George Floyd by name, twice, and offered support to an American bishop who knelt in prayer during a Black Lives Matter protest. Cardinals black and white have spoken out about Floyd's death, and the Vatican's communications juggernaut has shifted into overdrive to draw attention to the cause he now represents.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Floyd's killing at the hands of a white police officer and the global protests denouncing racism and police brutality might have drawn a muted diplomatic response from the Holy See. But in a U.S. election year, the intensity and consistency of the Vatican's reaction suggests that, from the pope on down, it is seeking to encourage anti-racism protesters while making a clear statement about where American Catholics should stand ahead of President Donald Trump's bid for a second term in November.\n\nFrancis \"wants to send a very clear message to these conservative Catholics here who are pro-Trumpers that, 'Listen, this is just as much of an issue as abortion is,'\" said Anthea Butler, a presidential visiting fellow at Yale Divinity School.\n\nPope Francis stands with President Donald Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, President Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband and White House senior advisor Jared Kushner during a private audience at the Vatican, May 24, 2017. Alessandra Tarantino / AFP/Getty Images\n\nButler, who is African American, said the Vatican is telling Catholics \"to pay attention to the racism that is happening and the racism that is in your own church in America.\"\n\nThe Vatican has long spoken out about racial injustice, and popes dating to Paul VI have voiced support for the civil rights movement and Martin Luther King Jr.'s message of nonviolent protest. History's first pope from the global south is no different. He quoted King at length during his historic speech to the U.S. Congress in 2015 and met with King's daughter, as his predecessor had done.\n\nBut the degree to which Francis and the Vatican have seized on Floyd's killing is unusual and suggests a coordinated messaging strategy aimed at a national church that Francis has long criticized for its political and ideological partisanship, said Alberto Melloni, a church historian and secretary of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna, Italy.\n\n\"It's not like seven people had the same type of reaction\" by chance, Melloni said.\n\nLast week, Francis denounced the \"sin of racism\" and twice identified Floyd as the victim of a \"tragic\" killing. In a message read in Italian and English during his general audience, Francis expressed concerns about violence during the protests, saying it was self-destructive.\n\n\"Sacredness of every human life\"\n\nHe also said, \"We cannot close our eyes to any form of racism or exclusion, while pretending to defend the sacredness of every human life.\"\n\nIt was a clear effort to call out some conservative Catholics for whom the abortion issue is paramount, while other \"life\" issues dear to Francis \u2014 racism, immigration, the death penalty and poverty \u2014 play second fiddle at the ballot box.\n\nFrancis has firmly upheld the church's opposition to abortion. And polls show a plurality of American Catholics support significant restrictions on legal abortion.\n\nBut Francis has also lamented that the U.S. church is \"obsessed\" with abortion, contraception and gay marriage to the detriment of its other teachings. Mr. Trump is staking his outreach to Catholic voters largely on his anti-abortion platform.\n\nFrancis spoke out June 3 after Mr. Trump posed in front of an Episcopal church near the White House, Bible in hand, after law enforcement aggressively forced protesters away from a nearby park.\n\nMilitary leaders slam Trump over protests as Barr defends clearing Lafayette Park\n\nA day later, Mr. Trump visited the St. John Paul II shrine, a visit denounced by the highest-ranking African American prelate in the U.S., Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington, D.C., whom Francis appointed to the politically important position last year. Gregory said he found it \"baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated.\"\n\nIn that vein, the pope's phone call to Texas Bishop Mark Seitz of El Paso last week appeared quietly significant. Seitz has taken a leading role in demanding fair treatment for migrants attempting to cross the southern U.S. border, a cause Francis has championed in ways that have fueled tensions with Mr. Trump.\n\nFrancis called Seitz unexpectedly after he was photographed kneeling in prayer at a Black Lives Matter protest. Seitz said the pope thanked him without mentioning the demonstration, but the context was clear: \"My recent words and actions on the events that are taking place in the country now\" after Floyd's killing.\n\nA photo provided by the Catholic Diocese of El Paso shows Bishop Mark Seitz, center, kneeling with other demonstrators at Memorial Park holding a Black Lives Matter sign in El Paso, Texas, June 1, 2020. Fernie Ceniceros/Catholic Diocese of El Paso/AP\n\nFrancis was not alone in making the Vatican's views known.\n\nWhile the Holy See would be loath to be seen as picking sides prior to the U.S. election, its media operation has made clear its backing for peaceful protests, denouncing injustices suffered by black Americans and underlining its longtime support of King's message.\n\nSunday's L'Osservatore Romano newspaper featured three Floyd-related stories on its front page. The first was that 1 million people were expected to protest that day in Washington.\n\nA second story was about a video showing two U.S. police officers shoving 75-year-old Martin Gugino, a white Catholic protester, to the ground in Buffalo. \"Go watch it, please,\" the article said.\n\nTrump tweets conspiracy theory about protester shoved by N.Y. police\n\nIts third story was about a prayer service presided over by the highest-ranking American at the Vatican, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who decried how America's constitutional ideals were failing its black citizens.\n\nIn an interview, Farrell said he has spoken to Francis in the past about America's race problems, which he saw up close as an auxiliary bishop in Washington. Farrell said Francis is well versed in King and American history.\n\nFrancis \"knows what the principle was and he knows what the struggle was,\" Farrell said.\n\nNatalia Imperatori-Lee, a professor of religious studies at Manhattan College, said the Vatican's message is having an effect on American Catholics.\n\n\"We are starting to see a kind of fissure emerge,\" she said. \"Whether that's going to be long lasting or whether it is a sign of a paradigm shift, I think it's too early to tell.\"\n\nA poll from the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute last week found that the share of white Catholics holding favorable views of Mr. Trump had dropped by double digits since last year, registering 37% in the last week of May compared with 49% across 2019.\n\nThe test, Imperatori-Lee said, will be if priests are still preaching about racism in six months.

On Monday, Nov. 9, 2020, Pfizer said an early peek at its vaccine data suggests the shots may be 90% effective at preventing COVID-19. (Courtesy of University of Maryland School of Medicine via AP, File)\n\nPfizer said Monday that an early peek at the data on its coronavirus vaccine suggests the shots may be a robust 90% effective at preventing COVID-19, putting the company on track to apply later this month for emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe announcement, less than a week after a presidential election that was seen as a referendum on President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, was a rare and major piece of encouraging news lately in the battle against the scourge that has killed more than 1.2 million people worldwide, including almost a quarter-million in the U.S. alone.\n\nPharmaceutical companies and various countries are in a global race to develop a vaccine against the virus.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a position potentially to be able to offer some hope,\u201d Dr. Bill Gruber, Pfizer\u2019s senior vice president of clinical development, told The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re very encouraged.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement doesn\u2019t mean a vaccine is imminent: This interim analysis, from an independent data monitoring board, looked at 94 infections recorded so far in a study that has enrolled nearly 44,000 people in the U.S. and five other countries. Some participants got the vaccine, while others got dummy shots.\n\nPfizer Inc. did not provide any more details about those infections and cautioned that the initial protection rate might change by the time the study ends. Even revealing such early data is highly unusual.\n\nAuthorities have stressed it\u2019s unlikely any vaccine will arrive much before the end of the year, and initial supplies will be rationed.\n\n\u201cWe need to see the data, but this is extremely promising,\u201d said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, former chief of the FDA\u2019s vaccine division. He ticked off many questions still to be answered, including how long the vaccine\u2019s effects last and whether it protects older people as well as younger ones.\n\nIf Pfizer\u2019s vaccine ultimately pans out, \u201cit\u2019s going to be a while before this has a major impact at the population level,\u201d Goodman said.\n\nMarylyn Addo, head of the tropical medicine unit at UKE hospital in Hamburg, Germany, said the interim results were \u201can interesting first signal,\u201d but questions remain.\n\nGlobal markets, already buoyed by the victory of President-elect Joe Biden, exploded on the news from Pfizer. Major markets in Europe, where infections have soared, were up 5%. In the U.S., Dow futures also rose 5% and were up about 1,400 points just over two hours before the opening bell.\n\nTrump, who had suggested during the presidential campaign that a vaccine could be ready by Election Day, tweeted on Monday: \u201cSTOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!\u201d\n\nPfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla said on CNBC that the election was always an artificial deadline and that the data was going to be ready when it was ready. The independent data monitors met on Sunday, analyzing the COVID-19 test results so far and notifying Pfizer.\n\n\u201cI am very happy,\u201d Bourla said, \u201cbut at the same time, sometimes I have tears in my eyes when I realize that this is the end of nine months, day-and-night work of so many people and how many people, billions, invested hopes on this.\u201d He added: \u201cI never thought it would be 90%.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious-disease expert, said he would be happy with a COVID-19 vaccine that was 60% effective. Scientists have warned for months that any COVID-19 shot may be only as good as flu vaccines, which are about 50% effective and require yearly shots.\n\nThe coronavirus shots, made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, are among 10 possible vaccine candidates in late-stage testing around the world \u2014 four of them so far in huge studies in the U.S. Another U.S. company, Moderna Inc., also has said it hopes to be able to file an application with the FDA later this month.\n\nVolunteers in the final-stage studies, and the researchers, don\u2019t know who received the real vaccine or a dummy shot. But a week after their second required dose, Pfizer\u2019s study began counting the number who developed COVID-19 symptoms and were confirmed to have the coronavirus.\n\nBecause the study hasn\u2019t ended, Gruber couldn\u2019t say how many in each group had infections. But the math suggests that almost all the infections counted so far had to have occurred in people who got the dummy shots.\n\nPfizer doesn\u2019t plan to stop its study until it records 164 infections among all the volunteers, a number that the FDA has agreed is enough to tell how well the vaccine is working. The agency has made clear that any vaccine must be at least 50% effective.\n\nNo participant so far has become severely ill, Gruber said. Nor could he provide a breakdown of how many of the infections had occurred in older people, who are at highest risk from COVID-19.\n\nParticipants were tested only if they developed symptoms, leaving unanswered whether vaccinated people could get infected but show no symptoms and unknowingly spread the virus.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFDA has told companies they must track half their participants for side effects for at least two months, the time period when problems typically crop up. Pfizer expects to reach that milestone later this month, but said Monday no serious safety concerns have been reported.\n\nBecause the pandemic is still raging, manufacturers hope to seek permission from governments around the world for emergency use of their vaccines while additional testing continues \u2014 allowing them to get to market faster than normal but raising concerns about how much scientists will know about the shots.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s scientific advisers last month said they worry that allowing emergency use of a COVID-19 vaccine could damage confidence in the shots and make it harder to ever find out how well they really work. Those advisers said it\u2019s critical these massive studies are allowed to run to completion.\n\n___\n\nAP writers Frank Jordans and Charles Sheehan contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

One of the exits of the subway station has even been turned into a memorial wall with flowers and messages of support.\n\nFloral tributes close off an entrance at Hong Kong's Prince Edward MTR station, after protesters accuse police of using excessive violence in the station.\n\nOn Friday, peaceful protesters gathered inside the Prince Edward subway station for a sit in to call on the MTR transport corporation to release CCTV of Sunday's incident.\n\nBut after police moved to disperse them, the protesters rapidly became violent, building barricades and pulling bricks out of the sidewalk to throw at police. \"Such acts seriously endanger public safety,\" Hong Kong police said on their official Twitter.\n\nHong Kong protesters' 5 demands Fully withdraw the extradition bill Set up an independent inquiry to probe police brutality Withdraw the characterization of protests as \"riots\" Release those arrested at protests Implement universal suffrage in Hong Kong\n\nThe ongoing demonstrations in Mong Kok come despite Chief Executive Lam announcing \"four actions\" to appease protesters on Wednesday, including the extradition bill's withdrawal and more communication by the government.\n\n\"We must find ways to address the discontent in society and look for solutions,\" Lam said in a a video statement Wednesday evening.\n\nBut with the protesters' four other demands unmet, including an investigation into police conduct and greater democracy in the city, the demonstrations look set to continue.\n\nOn the protesters' social media and communication groups, the rallying cry has been \"Five demands, not one less.\" No further concessions are expected by the Hong Kong government in the near future.\n\nRiot police stand in front a barricade set on fire by protesters after dispersing crowds outside the Mong Kok Police Station on September 7.\n\nAirport chaos\n\nHong Kong's international airport has increasingly become a focus for protesters. Disruptions at one of the world's busiest passenger and cargo hubs can have a major impact and attract global attention.\n\nRegular peaceful protests in the airport's arrival hall escalated on August 12 when a surge of demonstrators into Terminal 1 led to the cancellation all flights.\n\nThe next day demonstrators actively blocked passengers from heading to their departure gates, leading to more cancellations.\n\nBoth nights left thousands of passengers stranded and drew international headlines, leading Hong Kong's Airport Authority to get a court injunction blocking protesters from the terminal.\n\nUnable to demonstrate inside the terminal, protesters moved instead to block access to the airport on September 1 , barricading roads and throwing objects on the tracks of the Airport Express train.\n\nFor hours, all transport links to and from the airport were shut down, leaving passengers and plane crews forced to walk along roads to reach the terminal.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2020-nfl-mock-draft-dolphins-and-two-other-teams-trade-up-to-take-franchise-quarterbacks/", "authors": ["Ryan Wilson", "Min Read", "Cbs Sports Writer"], "title": "2020 NFL Mock Draft: Dolphins and two other teams trade up to take franchise quarterbacks", "text": "Round 1 - Pick 1 Joe Burrow QB LSU \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'4\" / 216 lbs Projected Team Cincinnati PROSPECT RNK 2nd POSITION RNK 1st This ain't hard. Take Burrow and move on.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 2 Chase Young EDGE Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'5\" / 265 lbs Projected Team Washington PROSPECT RNK 1st POSITION RNK 1st While we love Chase Young, Washington should listen to offers -- but unless they're blown away, take the layup, draft Young, and spend the rest of the draft rebuilding around Dwayne Haskins.\n\nMock Trade from Mock Trade from Detroit Lions Round 1 - Pick 3 Tua Tagovailoa QB Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 218 lbs Projected Team Miami PROSPECT RNK 3rd POSITION RNK 2nd It took 23 mock drafts (seriously!), but we have our first trade of the 2020 draft season. This is all contingent on Tagovailoa's health, and plenty of questions remain even after the quarterback made the rounds during Super Bowl week making it clear he plans to throw for teams before the draft. If he's healthy, he's a top-5 pick; if he's not ... then the Dolphins will need a Plan B for their tenuous QB situation.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 4 Isaiah Simmons LB Clemson \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 230 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Giants PROSPECT RNK 5th POSITION RNK 1st Typically we've had the Giants targeting an offensive linemen here (or even a cornerback) but this team ranked 27th in defense, according to Football Outsiders, and they were 31st against the pass. Simmons is one of the most athletic players in the country. He can play linebacker, safety, line up in the slot and even take snaps at cornerback. New York would basically be getting three players in one with Simmons.\n\nMock Trade from Mock Trade from Detroit Lions Round 1 - Pick 5 Justin Herbert QB Oregon \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'6\" / 237 lbs Projected Team Indianapolis PROSPECT RNK 20th POSITION RNK 3rd Herbert didn't play like a first-rounder in 2019 but his physical attributes check all the boxes for what NFL teams are looking for in a franchise quarterback, and he had a stellar Senior Bowl week, capped off by game MVP honors. In Indy, Herbert will provide the Colts an insurance policy against Jacoby Brissett, who has one more year left on his contract and is coming off a sluggish second half following a knee injury.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 6 Jedrick Wills Jr. OL Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'5\" / 320 lbs Projected Team L.A. Chargers PROSPECT RNK 9th POSITION RNK 1st The Chargers are also looking for a quarterback here, especially after the Colts traded up for Herbert. But whomever ends up under center will need to be protected, and Wills is one of the top offensive linemen in this class.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 7 Jeff Okudah CB Ohio State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 200 lbs Projected Team Carolina PROSPECT RNK 4th POSITION RNK 1st The Panthers secondary is young and it showed at times last season. James Bradberry is in the final year of his deal and whether he returns or not, it makes sense to add the top cornerback in the class in Okudah.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 8 Derrick Brown DL Auburn \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'5\" / 318 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 6th POSITION RNK 1st The Cards need to beef up the O-line but it's hard to pass up on Brown here. He's the best defensive tackle in this draft class and would upgrade a unit that wasn't even replacement level a season ago. Plus, 31-year-old Corey Peters, who led the unit with 805 snaps, has just one more year left on his deal.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 9 Mekhi Becton OL Louisville \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'7\" / 369 lbs Projected Team Jacksonville PROSPECT RNK 16th POSITION RNK 4th At 6-foot-7, 360 lbs., Becton is a mountain of a man but he moves like someone who weighs more like 260, which pairs nicely with his footwork, balance and strength -- as well as 2019 second-round right tackle Jawaan Taylor. Now the Jags just need to settle their QB situation.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 10 Javon Kinlaw DL South Carolina \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'6\" / 310 lbs Projected Team Cleveland PROSPECT RNK 7th POSITION RNK 2nd The Browns have their (next) coach in Kevin Stefanski, whose job now entails getting this talented group to play like a team. Making his job easier: Landing the best pass-rushing defensive tackle in the country; Kinlaw thought about coming out last year but returned to South Carolina where he had a stellar season, and then capped it off with an even better week of practice at the Senior Bowl.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 11 Andrew Thomas OL Georgia \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'5\" / 320 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Jets PROSPECT RNK 10th POSITION RNK 2nd Both left tackle Kelvin Beachum and right tackle Brandon Shell have contracts that will expire in a few weeks. Thomas was a freshman All-American right tackle and then moved to left tackle the last two years where he dominated, protecting QB Jake Fromm, who will hear his name called in the 2020 NFL Draft too. In New York, Thomas will protect Sam Darnold, who is coming off an up-and-down sophomore campaign.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 12 CeeDee Lamb WR Oklahoma \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'2\" / 189 lbs Projected Team Las Vegas PROSPECT RNK 8th POSITION RNK 1st The Raiders head to Las Vegas with plenty of questions, but CeeDee Lamb would give Jon Gruden an immediate playmaker to pair with Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow. Lamb is the toughest WR in this class and he's coming off a remarkable season for the Sooners where he averaged more than 20 yards per reception. The two biggest questions he must answer: How fast is he? And can he consistently beat press coverage, something he rarely saw in the Big 12?\n\nMock Trade from Mock Trade from Indianapolis Colts Round 1 - Pick 13 K'Lavon Chaisson EDGE LSU \u2022 Soph \u2022 6'4\" / 250 lbs Projected Team Detroit PROSPECT RNK 14th POSITION RNK 3rd The Lions' D-line ranked 31st in getting after the quarterback, according to Football Outsiders, and the entire defense ranked 29th in pass rush. Chaisson is explosive off the edge, though he'll likely need to gain some weight.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 14 Tristan Wirfs OL Iowa \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'5\" / 322 lbs Projected Team Tampa Bay PROSPECT RNK 13th POSITION RNK 3rd Wirfs was dominant last season and he can play either right or left tackle. In Tampa, Demar Dotson will be a free agent in March and Donovan Smith has two years left on his rookie deal. Now the Bucs just need to settle on a quarterback.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 15 Jerry Jeudy WR Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 192 lbs Projected Team Denver PROSPECT RNK 11th POSITION RNK 2nd Courtland Sutton is an emerging star who is a bona fide deep threat. Noah Fant is the dynamic tight end entering Year 2. Phillip Lindsay is the backfield playmaker, and Drew Lock is the quarterback who appears ready for the full-time job. Why not add one more weapon to this offense, the most exciting player in this draft class: Jerry Jeudy.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 16 Terrell Lewis EDGE Alabama \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'5\" / 252 lbs Projected Team Atlanta PROSPECT RNK 38th POSITION RNK 5th The Falcons 'D' played better down the stretch but the need for an edge rusher remains, especially with Vic Beasley in the final year of his contract. Lewis has battled through knee and elbow injuries that forced him to miss most of the previous two seasons but he's shown in 2019 just how disruptive he can be off the edge. After a strong Senior Bowl, there's a good chance he finds his way into Round 1.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 17 Henry Ruggs III WR Alabama \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'0\" / 190 lbs Projected Team Dallas PROSPECT RNK 17th POSITION RNK 3rd WR may not seem like an obvious need -- especially with glaring holes at safety -- but the Cowboys have to re-up Dak Prescott. Then there's Amari Cooper, whose future in Dallas seems less certain. There isn't a ton of depth at wideout on the roster, plus it would be hard to pass on Ruggs here. He's a burner and a threat to take it to the house every time he touches the ball.\n\nFrom From Pittsburgh Steelers Round 1 - Pick 18 Patrick Queen LB LSU \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 227 lbs Projected Team Miami PROSPECT RNK 41st POSITION RNK 3rd Raekwon McMillan and Sam Eguavoen both have one year left on their current deals and Jerome Baker's contract expires in two years. None rated better than average, according to Pro Football Focus' grades and Queen, who flashed early and often during the national title game (those 60 minutes of football served as a microcosm of his 2019 season), would give the Dolphins a much needed playmaker on defense.\n\nFrom From Chicago Bears Round 1 - Pick 19 CJ Henderson CB Florida \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'1\" / 202 lbs Projected Team Las Vegas PROSPECT RNK 25th POSITION RNK 4th The Raiders would've loved Queen here, but the Dolphins beat them to the punch. Instead, they settled for long, physical cornerback C.J. Henderson, who is the latest piece in Las Vegas' young, athletic, playmaking defense.\n\nFrom From Los Angeles Rams Round 1 - Pick 20 Trevon Diggs CB Alabama \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'2\" / 207 lbs Projected Team Jacksonville PROSPECT RNK 24th POSITION RNK 3rd D.J. Hayden was the Jags' most consistent cornerback, and the only one above replacement level, according to PFF. Jacksonville won't replace Jalen Ramsey with one player but Diggs would be a step in the right direction. Stefon's brother and a former wide receiver, Trevon is a big, physical player who can stand up against the NFL's best route runners. He'd fit right into Jacksonville's secondary.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 21 A.J. Epenesa EDGE Iowa \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" / 280 lbs Projected Team Philadelphia PROSPECT RNK 12th POSITION RNK 2nd Brandon Graham and Vinny Curry were the Eagles' two most efficient pass rushers, according to PFF, but Graham is 31 and Curry appears headed for free agency. Epenesa isn't a quick-twitch pass rusher like, say, Chaisson, but instead wins with power and tenacity. He can play on the edge or kick inside and it's that mix of versatility and athleticism that could make him attractive to the Eagles.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 22 Laviska Shenault Jr. WR Colorado \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'2\" / 220 lbs Projected Team Buffalo PROSPECT RNK 30th POSITION RNK 5th Another week, another mock draft where Shenault lands in Buffalo. Shenault can line up anywhere and would be a versatile chess piece in Brian Daboll's offense. How high he is selected will come down to his testing but when he's healthy he's damn near unstoppable. During the 2019 season, we compared him to Anquan Boldin -- but faster -- but as someone suggested to us on Twitter, a better comp might be A.J. Brown. We're guessing Josh Allen would welcome that type of playmaker to the Bills.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 23 Jacob Eason QB Washington \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'6\" / 227 lbs Projected Team New England PROSPECT RNK 34th POSITION RNK 5th The Pats have a history of taking fliers on big-armed, athletic QBs, though never this high. Jacoby Brissett, Jimmy Garoppolo and Ryan Mallett were either 2nd or 3rd-rounders, but then again, Tom Brady was never considering playing elsewhere, either. Eason reminds some people of Carson Palmer, though he'll need a year on the bench to learn the offense.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 24 Zack Baun LB Wisconsin \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'3\" / 235 lbs Projected Team New Orleans PROSPECT RNK 45th POSITION RNK 4th Baun is listed at 240 lbs., which means he might be better suited to play linebacker at the next level though some scouts were impressed with his pass-rush abilities during Senior Bowl week. Wherever he lines up, Baun is a playmaker; he had 11.5 sacks and 55 QB pressures in 2019. Demario Davis is coming off a lights-out 2019 season but AJ Klein will be a free agent next month and Kiko Alonso has one year left on his deal.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 25 Justin Madubuike DL \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'3\" / 304 lbs Projected Team Minnesota PROSPECT RNK 71st POSITION RNK 7th Madubuike declared for the draft last month after an impressive season for the Aggies. His low center of gravity coupled with strength, quickness and surprising athleticism for someone his size makes him a favorite to go on Day 2 and could even sneak into Day 1. Linval Joseph was the Vikings' best defensive linemen but the unit ranked 30th against the run, according to Football Outsiders.\n\nFrom From Houston Texans Round 1 - Pick 26 Josh Jones OL Houston \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'7\" / 310 lbs Projected Team Miami PROSPECT RNK 28th POSITION RNK 5th Jones had an outstanding season for the Cougars and that carried over to the Senior Bowl too. He has the type of strength and athleticism that translates well to the NFL. In Miami, he'd be part of a rebuilding effort that would begin with protecting the new face of the franchise, Tua Tagovailoa.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 27 Neville Gallimore DL Oklahoma \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'2\" / 302 lbs Projected Team Seattle PROSPECT RNK 21st POSITION RNK 3rd Gallimore is a fire plug with a non-stop motor who excels against both the run and the pass. The Seahawks, who have a history of bucking convention in Round 1, also have needs along the defensive line after the unit ranked 21st against the run and 30th in pass rushing last season, according to Football Outsiders' metrics.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 28 Kenneth Murray LB Oklahoma \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'2\" / 234 lbs Projected Team Baltimore PROSPECT RNK 26th POSITION RNK 2nd Josh Bynes played out of his mind last season but he's 30 and was on a one-year deal after spending the previous two seasons in Arizona (and the three before that in Detroit). Murray has sideline-to-sideline speed and is a middle-of-the-field playmaker who has the talent to be the next great inside linebacker in Baltimore.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 29 Jeff Gladney CB TCU \u2022 Sr \u2022 6'0\" / 183 lbs Projected Team Tennessee PROSPECT RNK 37th POSITION RNK 7th Logan Ryan and Tramaine Brock are two of the Titans' top three cornerbacks and both will be out of a contract in March. But even if Tennessee brings back one (or both), you can never have enough defensive backs on the roster. Gladney quietly had a standout season for the Horned Frogs. He might be one of the best cover corners in this draft class, and while he has the size (6-0), he'll need to add weight (he's listed at 183 lbs) to battle play in and play out with NFL receivers.\n\nRound 1 - Pick 30 Jalen Reagor WR TCU \u2022 Jr \u2022 5'11\" / 195 lbs Projected Team Green Bay PROSPECT RNK 43rd POSITION RNK 7th Jalen Reagor is a four-down player, who can line up anywhere, and would give Aaron Rodgers a smaller, quicker, faster pass-catching option on a wide receivers corps full of straight-line giants.\n\nMock Trade from Mock Trade from San Francisco 49ers Round 1 - Pick 31 Jordan Love QB Utah State \u2022 Jr \u2022 6'4\" / 225 lbs Projected Team Tampa Bay PROSPECT RNK 33rd POSITION RNK 4th The Bucs have a decision to make on their QB position. Do they re-up Jameis Winston and pray he somehow quits throwing interceptions, or take a flyer on Philip Rivers, assuming he's available? We know Bruce Arians' track record with developing quarterbacks, and if the plan is to find the next face of the franchise, Jordan Love could fit the bill. He's coming off a tough season at Utah State but like Herbert, the physical talent is off the charts.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://deadline.com/2020/07/johnny-depp-trial-verdict-explosive-moments-1202998148/", "authors": ["Jake Kanter"], "title": "Johnny Depp Libel Trial Verdict Not Expected Before September; Recap Of Court Battle\u2019s Most Explosive Moments", "text": "Billed as the biggest English libel trial of the 21st century, Johnny Depp\u2019s 16-day legal battle with Rupert Murdoch-owned tabloid newspaper The Sun concluded on Tuesday after both sides made their closing arguments at the High Court.\n\nJudge Justice Nicol is now set to take the coming weeks to deliberate over a verdict, which he is not expected to deliver until September at the earliest. It is likely to be a long wait for Depp, who has staked his reputation on the often ugly libel action, in which he has sought to disprove The Sun\u2019s claim that he is a \u201cwife beater.\u201d\n\nThe Pirates Of The Caribbean star was present at the High Court for every day of the proceedings, as was his ex-wife Amber Heard, who presented 14 allegations of abuse against Depp. These formed the backbone of The Sun owner News Group Newspapers\u2019 defense.\n\nOn the steps of the court on Tuesday evening, Heard acknowledged it had been a bruising three weeks, saying it had been \u201cincredibly painful to relive the break up of my relationship.\u201d Depp vehemently denies her allegations, with his attorney David Sherborne telling the court in his closing remarks that Heard is a \u201ccompulsive liar\u201d and that his client is \u201cno wife beater.\u201d\n\nWhen Justice Nicol delivers his verdict, it will come down to this: If the judge rules in Depp\u2019s favor, it will effectively exonerate him from claims that he assaulted Heard. If the decision goes against the actor, he will ultimately be deemed a \u201cwife-beater\u201d in an English court of law.\n\nBut it\u2019s unlikely to be the end of the matter. Depp is suing Heard for $50M in Virginia over a Washington Post column she wrote about domestic violence \u2014 a case that could reopen all the wounds that have been raked over in detail over the past three weeks in London.\n\nBelow is a recap of some of the libel battle\u2019s most explosive moments in chronological order:\n\nJuly 7: In opening remarks, Depp\u2019s legal team said he is seeking \u201cvindication,\u201d not damages from The Sun. \u201cDepp is either guilty of being a wife beater for having assaulted his ex-wife on numerous occasions, causing the most appalling injuries, or he has been very seriously and wrongly accused,\u201d said Sherborne.\n\nJuly 8: Taking to the witness stand, Depp denied slapping Heard after she laughed at his \u201cWino Forever\u201d tattoo. \u201cI didn\u2019t hit Ms Heard,\u201d he told court.\n\nJuly 8: The court heard the contents of an unsent email Heard wrote to Depp, in which she detailed his alleged \u201cDr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\u201d persona during their relationship. \u201cYou have hit me repeated. Something you should Never have done. What a f*cking man you are,\u201d she wrote.\n\nJuly 10: A \u201cdefecation incident\u201d in which feces were found in Depp and Heard\u2019s bed was a \u201cfitting end\u201d to the couple\u2019s relationship, Depp said. He was \u201cconvinced\u201d that it was either Heard herself, or one of her friends, who was involved in the episode.\n\nJuly 13: Depp said he did not intend to headbutt Heard during an alleged heated row between the couple at their Los Angeles penthouse. The argument took place the night before Heard was due to appear on The Late Late Show With James Corden.\n\nJuly 14: The court is told that Heard wrote in her diary about a \u201cterrible\u201d fight with her former husband Depp on a train journey during their 2015 honeymoon in Southeast Asia. \u201cJohnny\u2026 at one point found himself with his shirt wrapped around my neck,\u201d she wrote.\n\nJuly 15: Depp\u2019s former estate manager Ben King recalled how he found the actor\u2019s severed finger after an alleged altercation with Heard in Australia in 2015. Heard claimed the actor injured himself while smashing a telephone into a wall, but Depp alleged that the injury was the result of Heard throwing a vodka bottle at him.\n\nJuly 16: Depp\u2019s former lovers Winona Ryder and Vanessa Paradis are pulled from the witness stand, but their witness statements in his defense are published. \u201cThe idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved. I cannot wrap my head around these accusations. He was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen,\u201d Ryder said.\n\nJuly 17: Among the many sub-plots in the trial were accusations about Heard\u2019s interactions with other men during her relationship with Depp. Alejandro Romero, a concierge at Depp\u2019s LA penthouse, said Tesla founder Elon Musk regularly visited Heard late at night while Depp was away.\n\nJuly 20: Heard began her evidence and said Depp made her scared for her life. \u201cSome incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally or just by losing control and going too far. He explicitly threatened to kill me many times, especially later in our relationship,\u201d she said.\n\nJuly 21: Heard admitted to punching Depp to stop him pushing her sister down the stairs after remembering a \u201crumor\u201d he had done the same to Kate Moss. \u201cI did strike Johnny that day in defense of my sister. He was about to push her down the stairs and, the moment before that happened, I remembered information I had heard (that) he pushed a former girlfriend \u2013 I believe it was Kate Moss \u2013 down the stairs. I had heard this rumor from two people and it was fresh in my mind,\u201d she said.\n\nJuly 23: The court is told of Heard\u2019s texts to her mother calling Depp violent. \u201cHe\u2019s nuts, mum. Violent and crazy. I\u2019m heartbroken that this is who I love,\u201d she wrote.\n\nJuly 24: Johnny Depp\u2019s lawyers said they have been provided with a video from \u201can anonymous source\u201d which they said shows Heard \u201cattacked\u201d her sister. The footage showed Whitney Henriquez during the filming of a reality TV show, with one person heard saying \u201cdid you get in a fight?\u201d and then \u201cI can\u2019t believe Amber beat your ass.\u201d", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://nypost.com/2020/09/24/public-enemys-chuck-d-on-breonna-taylor-it-was-a-teachable-moment/", "authors": ["September"], "title": "Public Enemy\u2019s Chuck D on Breonna Taylor case: \u2018It was a teachable moment\u2019", "text": "Public Enemy is still ready to \u201cFight the Power.\u201d\n\nThirty-one years after that classic track dropped, the legendary Long Island posse returns Friday with a new LP, \u201cWhat You Gonna Do When the Grid Goes Down?\u201d It marks the group\u2019s return to Def Jam, the iconic hip-hop label that they helped build, and features \u201cFight the Power: Remix 2020,\u201d an all-star update of the 1989 anthem.\n\nThe Post spoke to PE leader Chuck D, 60, shortly after Wednesday\u2019s controversial Breonna Taylor decision.

The woman's son, his wife and her father have been diagnosed with the virus. The mother, son and wife share an apartment.\n\nThe two initial cases set off alarm bells among health officials that the virus could have been transmitted through pipes in the building. In densely populated Hong Kong this could lead to hundreds of people becoming infected in the supposed safety of their own homes.\n\nIn Hong Mei House, the two initial patients with coronavirus lived 10 floors apart, but were on the same vertical block of apartments -- number seven. Health authorities evacuated residents living in apartments numbered seven on all 30 floors of the building because their toilet discharge pipes were linked.\n\nThe possibility of the virus being transmitted through pipes immediately drew comparisons to the 2003 SARS outbreak, when this method became a major source of transmission. At the Amoy Gardens housing estate, there were more than 300 infections and 42 deaths after defective plumbing allowed the virus to spread through the building.\n\nAn investigation was launched Tuesday, but officials were quick to defend the building's sewage system as safe. Instead, Hong Kong housing minister Frank Chan said at a press conference that an initial investigation potentially pointed to a bathroom pipe of the second patient that could have been altered.\n\n\"A preliminary investigation revealed that the 307-room unit in which the second patient lived may have done self-refitting exhaust pipes,\" he said\n\nThe Hong Kong government also posted a photo on social media showing that a pipe in the apartment's bathroom had been altered.\n\nBut could this have led to a possible spread of the virus?\n\nOfficials wearing protective gear stand guard outside an entrance to the Hong Mei House residential building.\n\nFaecal matter\n\nThe evacuation at Hong Mei House was a precaution.\n\nWhile scientists are still investigating how the virus spreads, they believe it is mainly transmitted by direct contact, such as touching someone's hand, and through droplets, for example, an infected person sneezing or coughing on someone else.\n\nTherefore, the virus could have spread through the apartment block through close human contact or the shared use of elevator buttons.\n\nBut because the two patients lived directly above one another, and the initial inspection found that a pipe had been disconnected from the bathroom's waste pipe, authorities decided to investigate whether the virus could have spread through the building's sewage system.\n\nIvan Hung, chief of the Infectious Diseases Division at Hong Kong University, told CNN that early studies of the novel coronavirus suggested it is present in faecal matter, though investigations are still ongoing as to what extent the virus could be transmitted this way.\n\nMicrobiologist Yuen Kwok-yung said at a Tuesday press conference that an improperly sealed pipe could have resulted in a virus transmission, by carrying infected feces into the building's ventilation system and blowing it into people's bathrooms.\n\n\"As the pipeline that transfers feces is connected to the air pipe, it is very likely for the virus in the feces to be transmitted through the air fan into the toilet,\" Yuen said.\n\nThe pipes\n\nSo how does this work?\n\nEvery toilet, sink, and floor drain has a U-shaped pipe, which prevents sewer gases from entering the home and allows waste water and odors to escape. To work properly the U-shaped pipe, also known as a U-trap, needs to hold water in its bend.\n\nThese pipes connect to what's called a soil pipe, also known as a discharge pipe, which washes the waste away from the toilet, sink or drain.\n\nThe soil pipe needs to have a vent pipe connected, which ensures the sewer gases and odors are carried away -- usually through a vent in the roof. The vent pipe also makes sure that pressure in the drain is equalized so waste water keeps flowing.\n\n\"If you imagine the pipe linking all the toilets in the same unit on different floors -- it's like a Christmas tree,\" said Hung.\n\nDuring the SARS crisis, at Amoy Gardens the U pipes connecting to the floor drains were empty of water, according to a local investigation. That allowed virus-laden droplets coming down the pipes from other apartments to collect in the U-bend. Without the water to form a liquid plug, nothing stopped it from entering the bathroom.\n\n\"When the U-shaped pipe was not filled with water, the air in the discharge pipe of the bathroom can enter the indoor environment. Especially once the extraction fan in the bathroom is turned on,\" said Yuen.\n\nHong Kong officials have said Hong Mei House is different from the SARS scenario, however, because of the design of the pipes ensures water is always in the U-bend.\n\nTse Chin-Wan, undersecretary for the Hong Kong Environment Bureau, said on Tuesday that the pipes in Hong Mei House were not faulty.\n\nUnlike at Amoy Gardens, their floor drains were connected to the sink of kitchens or washing basin, meaning the U-bends were always full with water.\n\nIvan Hung, chief of the Infectious Diseases Division at Hong Kong University, told CNN the SARS case was \"very different and much more serious\" owing to a highly infectious patient and the virus being airborne.\n\nAs many as two-thirds of the patients in the Amoy Gardens outbreak had diarrhea, and that meant a large viral load -- the quantity of virus -- would have been discharged into the faulty drainage system.\n\nBut how can others get infected?\n\nJUST WATCHED Coronavirus global death toll surpasses 1,000 people Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Coronavirus global death toll surpasses 1,000 people 01:25\n\nIn Hong Mei House, authorities are still investigating a modified vent pipe that could have allowed the virus to spread.\n\n\"There are reasons to believe that confirmed cases of low-level units are caused by improper modification of toilet exhaust pipe,\" Leung Kar-ming, the district councilor representing Hong Mei House, told CNN in an email.\n\n\"It is to (be) believed at this stage it is due to improper modification of individual unit (307) where parts of the pipe were cut off and removed permanently.\"\n\nOne possibility is that infected material from the first patient's apartment could have traveled down the pipes and entered the room via the broken vent in the second patient's bathroom.\n\n\"If the patient is in the toilet and reading a newspaper, or whatever he's doing, then he will be exposed to this infected air,\" said Hung.\n\nWhile the investigation into the building continues, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection has advised the public to maintain drainage pipes by regularly pouring water into drain outlets -- the U-pipes -- and to put the toilet lid down before flushing \"to avoid spreading germs.\"\n\nIf it does emerge that the virus can travel through pipes, it will mean that residents staying at home to avoid the virus might be at risk in the place they felt most safe.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-hand-idUSKBN1YZ190", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "title": "Disgruntled Pope Francis pulls himself free from woman's grasp", "text": "ROME (Reuters) - A visibly indignant Pope Francis had to pull himself away from a woman in a crowd in St Peter\u2019s Square on Tuesday after she grabbed his hand and yanked him toward her.\n\nPope Francis was walking through the square in Vatican City and greeting pilgrims on his way to see the large Nativity scene set up in the huge, cobbled esplanade.\n\nAfter reaching out to touch a child, the pope turned away from the crowd only for a nearby woman to seize his hand and pull her toward him.

Charlie Baker's veto of the ROE Act, an expansion of abortion access in the state, according to State Senate President Karen Spilka.The State Senate vote in favor of overriding the governor's veto comes a day after the Massachusetts House of Representatives voted to do the same by a 107-46 margin.The abortion bill (H 5179) \u2014 which codifies abortion rights, expands abortion access for some minors, and allows the procedure after 24 weeks of pregnancy in some cases \u2014 has become state law.\"Protecting access to reproductive healthcare is now law in Massachusetts!\" Spilka tweeted Tuesday afternoon.\u201cThe passage of these reforms to improve abortion access is a historic milestone for reproductive freedom in Massachusetts. Today, the Commonwealth reestablished itself as a national leader in health care by removing political barriers to abortion and becoming the first state to legislatively ease burdensome restrictions on young people\u2019s access to care,\" reads a statement from the ROE Act Coalition. \"The legislature\u2019s leadership means no Bay State family who receives a devastating diagnosis later in pregnancy will ever be forced to fly across the country to access compassionate care and no 16- or 17-year-old will ever be forced to navigate the court system to access the health care they need. This legislation will significantly improve the health and wellbeing of Massachusetts residents and represents an important step in removing medically unnecessary barriers to abortion care in our state.\"Baker had first attempted to change the underlying proposal, but after his recommendations were rejected, he vetoed it on Christmas Eve.The Republican governor bristled at the plan to lower the age, from 18 to 16, at which individuals can seek abortions without first acquiring the consent of a parent or a judge and at the language outlining when an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy is allowed.Democratic leaders have faced increasing pressure from activists to expand abortion access in Massachusetts following the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.Chris Lisinski, of the State House News Service, contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/us-news-coronavirus-pandemic-2f9f8a32b5d9991790f4956497a50124", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "title": "Who will be the first to get COVID-19 vaccines?", "text": "Who will be the first to get COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nWho will be the first to get COVID-19 vaccines?

Lee", "Dec"], "title": "Bellator 237: Fedor vs. Rampage predictions", "text": "\u201cThe Last Emperor\u201d and \u201cRampage\u201d are coming home.\n\nIt\u2019s been a lifetime since Fedor Emelianenko and Quinton Jackson emerged as superstars in Japan\u2019s hallowed PRIDE Fighting Championships, though the two have made the occasional return to the country. It was in Saitama that Emelianenko ended a three-year retirement to defeat Jaideep Singh at a 2015 RIZIN show, and also where Jackson fought Ryan Bader at UFC 144 in 2012, which would be one of his last appearances for that promotion.\n\nNow under the Bellator banner, the two former champions headline a joint Bellator-RIZIN show that looks to be both rich in nostalgia and also a chance for some of the promotion\u2019s best to get their long-awaiated taste of JMMA glory.\n\nThree-time Bellator lightweight champion Michael Chandler competes in Japan for the first time, as do welterweight contenders Lorenz Larkin and Michael \u201cVenom\u201d Page. The main card also features Ilara Joanne facing the undefeated Kana Watanabe, and what should be a thrilling contrast of styles as Goiti Yamauchi meets Daron Cruickshank in a lightweight bout.\n\nWhat: Bellator 237\n\nWhere: Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan\n\nWhen: Saturday, Dec. 28. The six-fight main card begins at 10 p.m. ET on Paramount Network and the DAZN streaming service, with postliminaries taking place after the main event on Bellator\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nThis was probably more of a dream match 15 years ago, but better late than never, right?\n\nNeither Fedor Emelianenko nor Quinton \u201cRampage\u201d Jackson have any illusions about chasing major championships anymore, and if their goal is to simply seek fun fights on big stages, they\u2019d be hard-pressed to do better than a main event spot against one another at Saitama Super Arena. This is the kind of fight that North American fans might scoff at, but that Japanese fans will appreciate for what it is: another chance to see two legends shine in the twilight of their careers.\n\nAs for who will shine brighter, I\u2019m leaning towards the younger Jackson, who at a spry 41 years old has a little more left in the tank than Emelianenko, 43. Emelianenko actually hasn\u2019t fared too badly since joining Bellator with wins over Chael Sonnen and Frank Mir, but his losses to Ryan Bader and Matt Mitrione tell us everything we need to know. He can\u2019t deal with quicker fighters anymore, especially when they have power in their hands, and while Jackson isn\u2019t exactly flowing like a flyweight these days, he still has the kind of hand speed that will give Emelianenko problems.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Emelianenko\u2019s grappling\u2014which could be Jackson\u2019s foil\u2014is up to par. It\u2019s been a long time since Emelianenko has showed off the ground skills that made him one of the most feared submission artists of his day and hey may not have the capability nor the will anymore to battle through Jackson\u2019s stout takedown defense. This will likely be a stand-up affair with Emelianenko looking to give his Japanese fans one more highlight to savor.\n\nThey\u2019ll get one, he\u2019s just going to be on the wrong end of it.\n\nPick: Jackson\n\nMichael Chandler vs. Sidney Outlaw\n\nMichael Chandler should be wary here as Sidney Outlaw is a live underdog. He\u2019s stepping in for an injured Benson Henderson and will present Chandler with an entirely different puzzle to solve.\n\nFortunately for Chandler, Outlaw\u2019s greatest strength is one that he has dealt with on countless occasions. Wrestlers simply don\u2019t fare well against Chandler. He\u2019s an absolute stump when it comes to takedown defense and while Outlaw will be wise to push the pace and tire Chandler out, he\u2019s going to have to get past Chandler\u2019s power punches to do it and there\u2019s only so much he\u2019ll be able to take before wilting.\n\nI\u2019m predicting a first-round knockout for Chandler as he spoils Outlaw\u2019s Cinderalla hopes and sets himself up for a bounce-back in 2020.\n\nPick: Chandler\n\nIn his 16-year MMA career, Keita Nakamura has seen it all. He\u2019s well-rounded with an emphasis on grappling and he\u2019s also tough to finish. This is not just a showcase fight for Lorenz Larkin, who will have to be at his sharpest to avoid being dragged into Nakamura\u2019s world.\n\nThe question is whether Nakamura has enough offense to really trouble Larkin and take a decision, as there\u2019s a good chance this one goes the distance. Even if he takes Larkin down, keeping him on the mat is a major challenge and when they\u2019re not tied up, it will be Larkin who is doing the damage in the striking exchanges. He\u2019s quick and has great footwork, so as long as he sticks with his game plan, he\u2019ll be in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nLarkin by decision.\n\nPick: Larkin\n\nThis is some great matchmaking pitting two aggressive flyweights against one another, the hard-hitting Ilara Joanne and the submission-minded Kana Watanabe. Neither will be looking to take a step back in the early going, nor are they going to play things safe if they think there\u2019s a chance to finish. Watanabe is an aggressive guard passer on the ground and Joanne\u2019s stand-up occasionally shows flashes of vintage Wanderlei Silva, which should endear her to the Japanese crowd.\n\nI actually like Watanabe\u2019s chances to get Joanne to the ground, where she can neutralize the Brazilian\u2019s potent punches. Joanne, just 25 years old, is rapidly improving when it comes to her patience and cardio, but Watanabe\u2019s grappling is going to give her a headache. As long as she can avoid the flurries of Joanne and times her takedowns properly, this is Watanabe\u2019s fight to lose.\n\nPick: Watanabe\n\nThere\u2019s no kind way of putting it: Daron Cruickshank has always struggled with grapplers and they\u2019ve matched him up with one of Bellator\u2019s best here. Goiti Yamauchi has 19 career submission victories, Cruickshank has suffered seven of his 12 losses by submission. The math is not in Cruickshank\u2019s favor.\n\nAs long as this one is on the feet though, Cruickshank has a chance of landing a spectacular strike. \u201cThe Detroit Superstar\u201d will throw anything at any time and he\u2019s produced some of RIZIN\u2019s best highlights over the last few years. It is by no means out of the question that Cruickshank knocks Yamauchi out. If Yamauchi isn\u2019t careful, he\u2019ll find himself going viral overnight.\n\nOn the ground though, the gap between the two is enormous and Cruickshank won\u2019t last long down there if he can\u2019t stay off his back. It will be elementary if Yamauchi gets his hooks in, with a rear-naked choke all but guaranteed in that scenario.\n\nThis should be fun while it lasts, but Yamauchi should impose his will on this matchup and snag submission No. 20.\n\nPick: Yamauchi\n\nMichael Page vs. Shinsho Anzai\n\nShinsho Anzai has no chance.\n\nOkay, this is MMA, so saying anyone has no chance is not only disrespectful, it\u2019s also foolish as the list of epic upsets in fighting is a long one and nobody, not even Michael Page is above the whims of the often cruel MMA Gods. And how merry they would be having \u201cMVP\u201d slip on the proverbial oil slick in his first-ever appearance in Japan.\n\nStill, let\u2019s not overthink this. Anzai is a strong wrestler with a hard head, but he\u2019s also a target, which is to say he\u2019s the kind of opponent that Page has built his career on. Page will be wary of Anzai\u2019s takedown game and adjust his style accordingly, eschewing his kicks to focus on using his considerable reach advantage to box Anzai to bits. If Anzai dares to get wild and fire back, he\u2019ll play right into Page\u2019s hands.\n\nPage has yet to meet a wrestler who can assert themselves against him and after Saturday that will still be true.\n\nPick: Page", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2019/05/31/kenny-rogers-hospitalized-dehydration-physical-therapy/1298552001/", "authors": ["The Associated Press", "Published A.M.

Despite raising $6.4 billion in additional liquidity last month -- enough to keep it afloat through next year -- industry uncertainties dictate taking a stand sooner rather than later even as many of its crew members await to be repatriated off of the ships they are currently not allowed to leave.\n\nCarnival's press release isn't all negative. It does point out that booking trends for the first half of next year remain within historical ranges -- even though it's not clear if Carnival is talking about only new bookings, or if it's also including the passengers on cancelled sailings who are applying future cruise credits to 2021 vacations.\n\nOn a potentially related and more encouraging note, Carnival is also saying that less than 38% of its passengers on cancelled sailings are requesting refunds.\n\nShore leave\n\nCarnival, Royal Caribbean International (NYSE:RCL), and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) are giving passengers on nixed cruises the option of a refund -- warning in some cases that it may take as long as three months to process -- or the ability to use the money that's already been paid as credit for a future sailing. Cruise lines have tried to improve their chances of preserving the money they've already collected by sweetening the deal for future cruise credit, giving folks hundreds in onboard credit or up to 25% in additional value for what they already paid.\n\nHaving just 38% of its passengers requesting refunds is a good thing, especially since a month ago, Carnival was saying that 55% of the people contacting the cruise line about cancelled sailings wanted their money back for the month of March. If anything, one would figure the percentage of folks wanting cash refunds would get worse over time, especially as sailing resumption dates keep getting pushed out and negative industry headlines are everywhere.\n\nOne can always hope for a little more clarity out of Carnival regarding that 38% refund request rate. Does this mean 62% of the customers have actively opted for future cruise credit, or is it also including folks who have yet to contact Carnival with a decision? It's still an encouraging development.\n\n\"The majority of guests affected by our schedule changes want to sail with us at a later date,\" reads Carnival's announcement on Wednesday. That certainly was not the case with the first wave of affected passengers who were reaching out to the cruise line in the first few weeks of cancelled trips.\n\nCarnival's news is in line with what Royal Caribbean reported earlier this month. The country's second largest cruise line operator had also reported that bookings for next year were in line with historical ranges and that fewer than half of its passengers -- in Royal Caribbean's case, 45% of them -- were asking for their money back.\n\nThis is obviously a fluid situation. A lot has to happen for the cruise lines to start sailing again, and most of it is now out of their control. We also don't know what the consumer appetite for sailings will be once a plan is in place for exactly what the cruising experience will be like with the inevitable safeguard measures in place.\n\nThere's also the pesky -- and at this point seemingly inevitable -- global recession that will be in play at the other end of this pandemic crisis and how that could limit the ability to pay for future sailings. However, for now, Carnival shareholders can take comfort in knowing that its refund request rate is improving -- and that matters.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/earthquake-nevada-felt-from-utah-to-california", "authors": ["Chris Irvine", "Chris Irvine Is Senior News Editor At Fox News.

Here are five things we learned about the Gamecocks in the win.\n\nJavon Kinlaw cannot be stopped\n\nThe stat sheet didn\u2019t count quarterback hurries Saturday. If it did, senior defensive lineman Javon Kinlaw would almost certainly have been the leader. The Gamecock big man was a force on the interior of the line, blowing up plays and making Georgia QB Jake Fromm\u2019s afternoon a nightmare. Georgia\u2019s offensive line is considered one of the best in the country, and Kinlaw proved nearly impossible to stop. That constant pressure helped lead to three USC interceptions and a fumble.\n\nWhile cornerback Israel Mukuamu was named national defensive player of the week, Kinlaw was at the heart of Carolina\u2019s standout defensive performance, and he likely sent his NFL draft stock even higher as a result.\n\nExplore where you live. Subscribe for 12 FREE weeks of unlimited digital access. SAVE NOW\n\nErnest Jones has come into his own\n\nBehind Kinlaw and Mukuamu, sophomore linebacker Ernest Jones quietly put together an outstanding day for USC \u2014 a team-leading 12 tackles, three pass break-ups and half a sack. Jones also continues to lead the team in tackles, both total and solo.\n\nA large reason why South Carolina\u2019s defense was so successful in shutting down Georgia was its improved tackling, which in turn limited the number of explosive plays the Bulldogs had \u2014 no runs for more than 15 yards, and just one pass of more than 20 yards. Jones, a Georgia native not offered by UGA in high school led that effort, and he made it clear going into the matchup that he wasn\u2019t all that fond of the Bulldogs. It was an impressive performance by a young player who played a limited role last year.\n\nRico Dowdle is the best option at running back\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s ground game was foundational to its win against Kentucky, and while the Gamecock tailbacks were less integral against Georgia, senior Rico Dowdle continued to show why he\u2019s the top dog in the backfield. On 21 carries, he went for 79 yards, both numbers far ahead of his teammates. Especially in the first half, he ran with the edge he\u2019s had all season to break down Georgia\u2019s vaunted rush defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Tavien Feaster, the Clemson transfer who was expected to either pass Dowdle or share responsibility with him, carried the ball just seven times for 27 yards. And tellingly, in overtime and facing a fourth-and-1 situation, coach Will Muschamp put the ball in Dowdle\u2019s hands. He rewarded that faith with an eight-yard gain.\n\nUSC\u2019s bowl hopes are back in a big way\n\nBefore Saturday, South Carolina had three games it was favored to win, according to ESPN\u2019s Power Football Index \u2014 Tennessee, Vanderbilt and Appalachian State. That made the path to six wins and a bowl berth look bleak. A 5-7 record seemed to be the most likely scenario.\n\nNow, the Gamecocks are sitting at 3-3 with three games they\u2019ll likely be favored in, as well as a game against a struggling Texas A&M. Throw in this upcoming Saturday\u2019s game against Florida, where the Gamecocks are 7.5-point underdogs, and eight wins is difficult, but not nearly as unlikely as it seemed a week ago.\n\nDakereon Joyner has work to do\n\nWhen freshman quarterback Ryan Hilinski went down with an apparent knee injury in the third quarter on Saturday, it was time for one-time third-string QB Dakereon Joyner to take over.

(AP Photo/Domenico Stinellis)\n\nROME (AP) \u2014 The U.N. epidemiologist who denounced the World Health Organization\u2019s withdrawal of a report on Italy\u2019s coronavirus response says he is suffering retaliation for having spoken out and is calling for the agency to live up to its obligations to protect whistleblowers.\n\nDr. Francesco Zambon said he filed an internal ethics complaint with the WHO in May after he said he was pressured by a senior WHO official to falsify data to obscure that Italy hadn\u2019t updated its influenza pandemic preparedness plan since 2006.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Zambon said he never wanted to enter into a fight with the WHO but now feels he is being isolated professionally for having followed WHO regulations to report alleged misconduct.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be silent,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing this because I believe in the WHO and because I believe in the values of the WHO. One of them is integrity.\u201d\n\nZambon, WHO\u2019s chief field coordinator for Italy and its regions during the pandemic, was one of the authors of a WHO report examining how Italy responded when it became the epicenter of the European outbreak in late February. The report was aimed at helping other countries prepare as the virus spread globally, but hit a sensitive nerve here because it noted that Italy went into the crisis with an out-of-date pandemic plan and that its initial reaction was \u201cimprovised, chaotic and creative.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe WHO pulled the report from its website on May 14, a day after it went up, and never republished it. WHO said it contained \u201cfactual inaccuracies,\u201d but hasn\u2019t said what they were. Zambon says the only inaccuracy was an out-of-date timeline of the virus in China that he removed immediately, but the report was never re-uploaded or distributed.\n\nThe scandal over the report\u2019s withdrawal has made headlines in Italy amid suggestions that WHO yanked the report to spare the government criticism, embarrassment and liability.\n\nIn the interview, Zambon said he was pressured to fudge the fact that Italy hadn\u2019t updated its pandemic preparedness plan since 2006. He cited a May 11 email from Dr. Ranieri Guerra, an assistant director general at the WHO who was working as a liaison with the Italian government, telling him to \u201ccorrect\u201d the date to show that the plan had been \u201clast updated in 2016.\u201d He said Guerra followed up with a phone call that he described as threatening.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGuerra had been in charge of prevention at the Italian Health Ministry from 2014-2017, and wrote the then-minister that the plan needed to be updated.\n\nZambon said he refused cede to Guerra\u2019s request because the 2016-2017 plan was the same as the 2006 one. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t really say that the plan was updated because it was not true,\u201d he said.\n\nGuerra declined repeated requests for comment to AP. In an interview with La7 television Sunday, he said the earlier plan was considered \u201ccurrent\u201d up until the release of new WHO guidelines in 2018, by which time he had left the ministry.\n\nBut the 2006 plan contains holes in its implementation phases which critics say could help explain Italy\u2019s critical shortage of protective equipment and chaotic initial response to COVID-19.\n\nGuerra also denied he exerted any pressure on Zambon and said he couldn\u2019t fire him because he reports to a different WHO chain of command.\n\nThe WHO didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests about the status of Zambon\u2019s complaint. The WHO has previously said it has mechanisms to handle internal issues and disputes.\n\nBoth Guerra and Zambon, meanwhile, have spoken with Italian prosecutors investigating the government\u2019s response, in defiance of WHO guidelines.\n\nA Nov. 1 email from the WHO\u2019s legal department, reported by state-run RAI television\u2019s \u201cReport\u201d program, noted that the U.N. agency was facing several lawsuits and parliamentary inquiries into COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe need to be mindful not to set a precedent or to implicitly waive any of the immunities applicable to WHO by attending such hearings,\u201d said the email.\n\nItalian public health officials have said they had no idea the WHO report was even in the works, suggesting a communications breakdown between the U.N. agency and the government. As WHO liaison to the government, Guerra was given a detailed outline of the report on April 14 to share with the government but it\u2019s not clear how broadly it was shared or if he followed up.\n\nDr. Giovanni Rezza, head of infectious disease at Italy\u2019s Superior Institute of Health, said he didn\u2019t see anything in the report that was terribly problematic, much less worthy of censorship. \u201cIf anyone is going to look for possible responsibility, clearly this concerns the period in which the plan wasn\u2019t updated,\u201d he told a briefing on Dec. 12.\n\n\u201cNaturally one can do a self-criticism, but I didn\u2019t find any reason to censor the report,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m shocked if that\u2019s what happened.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumps-defenders-he-doesnt-hate-the-troops-he-just-sounds-like-an-asshole", "authors": ["Asawin Suebsaeng", "White House Reporter"], "title": "Trump\u2019s Defenders: He Doesn\u2019t Hate the Troops, He Just \u2018Sounds Like an Asshole\u2019", "text": "After The Atlantic reported on Thursday that Donald Trump had privately trashed American war dead as \u201csuckers\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d the White House, the president\u2019s 2020 campaign, and a broad array of Trump loyalists activated to aggressively denounce the report as fictitious and absurd.\n\nIn The Daily Beast\u2019s interviews with 11 senior administration officials, Trump aides, Republican operatives, and former and current friends of the president, several of them mounted a curious defense of Trump. Yes, they admitted, the commander in chief at times makes callous, tone-deaf comments about American military personnel behind closed doors. But it\u2019s because he hates the wars they\u2019re forced to fight, not the service members themselves.\n\n\u201cThe president means no disrespect to our troops; it\u2019s just that the way he speaks, he can sound like an asshole sometimes,\u201d one of these sources, a current senior administration official, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThat\u2019s how he is [when the cameras are off]\u2026 It\u2019s his style.\u201d\n\nSome of these sources defending President Trump and pushing back on The Atlantic\u2019s story agreed to go on the record. Others would only speak on background and in an anonymous capacity\u2014even after the White House trashed the magazine for relying on such nameless sources. (The president on Friday afternoon called the story a \u201choax,\u201d even though the Associated Press and Fox News had confirmed key details of the original piece.)\n\nSome of these individuals close to the president did concede there was one part of Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s article that rang true to them: the anecdote about Trump joining John Kelly, his former White House chief of staff, on a visit to the grave of Kelly\u2019s son Robert\u2014who was killed in the war in Afghanistan\u2014and coldly asking Kelly, \u201cI don\u2019t get it. What was in it for them?\u201d\n\nThree people with direct knowledge of the president\u2019s private remarks in the past three years about Robert Kelly, as well as other Americans who\u2019ve died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said that Trump had made similar-sounding comments to them, too. This included the president mentioning that their service in these war zones was a \u201cwaste,\u201d or that U.S. military personnel in these conflicts had \u201cdied for nothing,\u201d or that the fallen \u201cshould have been doing something else.\u201d\n\nHowever, these sources, who would only speak on the condition of anonymity, all independently insisted that Trump was not disrespecting the U.S. war dead; he was merely stating a belief that they should not have been sent overseas to fight and die in these wars in the first place. Each said that the president often has a brash, ill-mannered way of talking that can obscure what they believe to be his intended message, especially in moments when Trump is trying to convey sympathy or empathy.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story by Friday evening.\n\nFor all of Trump\u2019s talk about putting an end to these \u201cendless wars,\u201d he has yet to actually end any of them, and he even escalated the war in Afghanistan earlier in his first term. He has also actively encouraged and used the powers of his office to excuse American war crimes, and also escalated air wars on various foreign countries, with disastrous consequences for civilians abroad.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been friends with Trump since 2005. Are there times he says things that people get upset with? Yes, but to those suggesting he is lacking empathy... I have seen first-hand on many occasions and have been personally touched by his compassion and empathy,\u201d said Eric Bolling, a Sinclair anchor and a close friend of the Trump family.\n\nDuring his first term in office, Trump has indeed managed to shambolically fumble his outreach to grieving families. In 2017, when the president spoke on the phone to the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who died in an operation in Niger, Trump reportedly said to her: \u201cHe knew what he signed up for, but I guess it still hurt.\u201d\n\nAccording to those present for her end of the phone conversation, this led that widow, Myeshia Johnson, to begin breaking out in tears. President Trump, refusing to accept any culpability for this, quickly pivoted to claiming the whole incident was an elaborate fabrication, and began bashing Democrats and the media instead.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has always shown the highest level of respect and empathy for veterans, wounded warriors, and surviving family members who have lost relatives in combat,\u201d Jason Miller, a top adviser on the Trump re-election campaign, told The Daily Beast on Friday, insisting that the Atlantic story was \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s well-known comments about the late senator John McCain being a \u201closer\u201d and not a real war hero because he was \u201ccaptured\u201d and tortured during the Vietnam War, Miller echoed the president, replying, \u201cThe president has always shown the utmost respect for those defending our country, and simply because the president is willing to throw some tough elbows in the political arena doesn\u2019t give The Atlantic permission to write a completely made-up, false story alleging the president is disrespectful to those who\u2019ve made the ultimate sacrifice.\u201d\n\nAsked about Trump\u2019s bitter feud with the Gold Star parents of the Khan family during the 2016 presidential race, Miller responded, \u201cPresident Trump always has the right to defend himself in the political arena.\u201d", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-loaded-gun-mdc-prison-20200306-oexfjwqg5vhz3eutokn3upf4ju-story.html", "authors": ["Stephen Rex Brown", "John Annese"], "title": "Loaded gun found smuggled into Manhattan federal jail where Jeffrey Epstein died", "text": "\u201cIt is expected that visitation from inmates\u2019 families and friends may resume later next week, or as soon as possible,\u201d Ayers said.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/videos/health/2020/03/13/part-1-coronavirus-town-hall-fact-fears-march-12-2020-sot-vpx.cnn", "authors": [], "title": "Entire CNN coronavirus town hall", "text": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Plus, musical guest: Split Enz!\n\n1a. It sounds like Mike Evans, Chris Godwin and Antonio Brown will all be a go on Sunday night, along with a Bucs offensive line that's been much better since the season-opening loss in New Orleans. So if the Saints are going to get the season sweep and move back into the driver's seat in the NFC South, their defensive backfield has to step up.\n\nThat Week 1 win over the Bucs was the best performance of the season for a veteran secondary that hasn't been nearly as good as it should be. Among other problems, Marshon Lattimore doing his Jekyll thing (you might say Hyde, but I imagine Hyde would hold up better in man coverage than Jekyll) and Malcolm Jenkins looking like a shell of his former self. In Week 1, most of the damage Tampa did through the air was in the form of ticky-tack pass interference flags. The pass rush could always take over\u2014it was excellent in that Week 1 win, highlighted by Trey Hendrickson obliterating Donovan Smith\u2014but in all likelihood, it's going to depend on the coverage holding up.\n\n1b. I see the \u201cTom Brady wants people to be their best\u201d narrative winning out with large sects of the media when it comes to the indefensible Antonio Brown signing. And we all want the best for people, don\u2019t we?\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about \u201cwanting people to be their best,\u201d especially in cases like this: It usually involves making difficult choices that don't always benefit you personally. The last time Brown teamed up with Brady, he felt empowered to personally threaten a woman who had credibly accused him of sexual misconduct. And while the Patriots\u2019 next course of action was obvious\u2014no respectable organization could tolerate Brown at that point\u2014it was reportedly done over the objections of Brady.\n\nI\u2019m not a mental-health expert and can\u2019t give a surefire course of action for how Brown\u2019s mental health issues would best be served, but if the past few years are any indication, being a professional football player is not good for the prospect of Brown becoming his best self. And if the past 14 months are any indication, teaming up with Brady, specifically, is even more problematic. If Brady was concerned with making Brown a better person, he would have made the decision to let him sign somewhere else or, even better, advised him not to sign anywhere at all. (Also, I enjoyed Tony Robbins in Shallow Hal as much as the next guy, but it shouldn't be confused for a documentary, and surely it\u2019s worth looking beyond the entertainment industry for professional help.)\n\nBrady\u2019s interest is in winning the Super Bowl\u2014understandable, considering he\u2019s a professional football player\u2014and adding the best receiver in football to your roster for pennies on the dollar is a good way to accomplish that. There are lots of people around the league who would do the same thing. But there\u2019s no need to assign some contrived altruistic purpose to it just because Brady claims there is.\n\n1c. To clarify, I didn\u2019t really enjoy anything about Shallow Hal. I love Jack Black because I\u2019m a big Tenacious D guy, but that film was a little too Farrelly Brothers-y.\n\n* * *\n\n2. While you were distracted by Tua all week, you missed the fact that the Dolphins defense is going to carry them to the postseason. Byron Jones has been healthy for four games this season (Noah Igbinoghene is a fine prospect, but he was a trainwreck filling in for Jones) and Miami is 3-1 and allowing 13.8 points per game and 5.45 yards per attempt in those games. And while the Dolphins are underdogs against a second consecutive NFC West opponent, they match up especially well with the Cardinals.\n\nMiami\u2019s weakness is on first down, when they\u2019re allowing a league-high \u201csuccess rate\u201d (four yards or more allowed) of 62.3%. But they\u2019re making up for it with elite pass defense. The Cardinals\u2019 Air Raid offense leans heavily on quick-strike passing and Kyler Murray scrambles\u2014Murray remains woefully inaccurate at the intermediate and deep-intermediate levels; his completion percentage on throws 15-plus-yards downfield (31.8%) is 28th out of 31 qualifiers this season. Along with the ability to match up with Arizona\u2019s wideouts, especially early in the down, with Jones and Xavien Howard, the Dolphins have done a solid job limiting QB scrambles. Cam Newton went for 75 rushing yards in the season opener, but that was primarily on designed runs. Josh Allen only went for 19 rushing yards against the Dolphins, and Russell Wilson for five.\n\nMiami's defense should be able to hold down their end of the bargain, which means it could be up to Tua Tagovailoa. A lot of his issues in an underwhelming debut were due to a lack of pocket presence\u2014not a shocker considering the layoff and the fact that NFL pockets are drastically different (much more claustrophobic) than those in the college game, especially if you\u2019re playing behind an offensive line like Alabama\u2019s. Facing a Cardinals defense that doesn\u2019t generate much pressure with their four-man rush should allow him to find a little more of a rhythm, and perhaps carry the Dolphins to a win if he has to.\n\n* * *\n\n3. In a nation of 328 million people, that only 12 of them got moved at the NFL trade deadline was truly a disappointment. And most of that disappointment revolves around Will Fuller, for whom the Texans were reportedly asking for a second-round pick that suitors (the Packers, specifically) would not part with.\n\nFuller is in the final year of his rookie deal, and a lot of folks are factoring comp pick value into his trade value (in other words, even if he\u2019s a three-month rental, the Packers would recoup a pick in 2022). But if I were you, I\u2019d be careful about projecting Fuller as fetching a second contract that would warrant a third-rounder in the comp pick calculation.\n\nThe wide receiver market is bizarre. It\u2019s being recognized as one of the most valuable non-quarterback positions in football, but there are also so many good young receivers in the league that the market is flooded. Last year was considered one of the strongest WR draft classes ever, and next year\u2019s class is arguably better. Because of that\u2014both the level of talent and the farce that is the rookie wage scale forcing that talent to sign far-below-market long-term deals\u2014free-agent receivers aren\u2019t getting their fair share on the open market.\n\nFuller is a quality No. 2 receiver, a high-end deep threat when he\u2019s healthy (drop-prone, sure, but it\u2019s better to be a guy who gets open and drops it than a guy who can\u2019t separate at all). But do you know who is objectively better, not to mention more durable, than Will Fuller? Robby Anderson, who had to settle for a two-year, $20 million deal last offseason. That would only be worth a fourth-round comp pick according to Over The Cap\u2019s projections. The only other receivers who got multi-year deals last offseason were Emmanuel Sanders (two years, $24 million) and the baffling Randall Cobb contract (three years, $27 million; sorry, Randall Cobb is a great guy who\u2019s had a fine career, but come on).\n\nI would think that Fuller, because of the injury history, falls somewhere between Anderson and Breshad Perriman (one year, $6.5 million), and, again, the 2021 WR draft class is considered just as stacked, if not more so, than 2020\u2019s, which made everyone hesitant to pay receivers last offseason. There\u2019s also a good chance JuJu Smith-Schuster, A.J. Green, Sammy Watkins, Marvin Jones and/or Corey Davis could hit the market as comparable (if stylistically diverse) No. 2 receivers, with an outside chance that true No. 1s in Kenny Golladay and Allen Robinson could also make it to the open market.\n\nFuller is 27 in April, which suggests long-term deal, but injuries have limited him to fewer than 600 snaps each of the previous three seasons. I\u2019d expect him to top out at a deal like Anderson\u2019s, with a chance he\u2019ll have to take one closer to Periman\u2019s when you factor in the drop in salary cap. That would mean he\u2019s only factoring in as a fifth-round comp pick, and when the calculus becomes swapping Pick 60 in 2021 for Pick 175 in 2022 (if the rest of your comp pick calculus evens out), plus eating up some of the cap space you intended to roll over, in exchange for a rental, the price gets to be a little too steep.\n\n* * *\n\n4. Every year there\u2019s a middle-of-the-pack team that gets an obscenely front-loaded schedule, starts off terribly, and because they\u2019re out of it early the narrative gets locked in that they\u2019re hopeless. Last year it was the Jets, who drew New England twice, Buffalo and a road game at Philly over their first six games (and played three of them with a third-string QB) and started 1-7. When they finished 6-2 against the soft side of the schedule, no one cared.\n\nThis year it\u2019s the Texans, who were clear underdogs in five (or six, depending on how you view the Vikings) of their first seven games, started 1-6, but will likely be giving points in at least four of their final eight games. It\u2019s too late for a run to the playoffs, but they\u2019re going to get to six or seven wins, which is within the margin for error for a team that entered the year as the third-best team in their own division.\n\n* * *\n\n5.

The lockdown is due to be reviewed on 7 May.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said Sage would be reporting to the prime minister and to cabinet, with decisions about any easing of the lockdown being made on the basis of the evidence they provided.\n\nHowever, he added: \"Being absolutely frank, I don't think you're going to hear specific detail - I think that would be premature.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson said the lockdown would not be relaxed too soon and details on any changes would be set out over the \"coming days\".\n\nAt Wednesday's press conference, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK was still \"coming through the peak\" of the virus and called for people to maintain social distancing measures \"until we are out of the woods\".\n\nThe total number of people who have died in the UK with coronavirus has now passed 26,000, as official figures include deaths in the community, such as in care homes, for the first time.\n\nA new method of counting includes retrospective deaths since the beginning of March.\n\nTesting target\n\nThe health secretary set out the government's daily testing target of 100,000 per day on 2 April, even though Mr Johnson initially identified the aim to carry out 250,000 tests a day.\n\nThe latest figures announced during Wednesday's briefing showed 52,429 people were tested for Covid-19 in the UK on Tuesday, despite Mr Hancock announcing a massive expansion of the groups eligible for testing earlier in the week.\n\nMinisters say that there is capacity for about 73,000 tests per day, and Downing Street has repeatedly said it is aiming to reach its target by Thursday.\n\nMr Buckland said even if the target wasn't met \"we are well on our way to ramping this [testing] up\" and \"we are straining every sinew to get there\".\n\n\"100,000 is an important milestone, but frankly we need more,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\nProf Newton, director of public health improvement for Public Health England (PHE), said on Wednesday that he was \"pretty confident we will hit that target\".\n\nHe said there would be a lag due to receiving the data but it would be clear whether the government has reached the target by the end of the week.\n\nBut a report by NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and NHS trusts in England, dismissed the target as a \"red herring\".\n\nDescribing the target as \"arbitrary\", the report said it risked preventing the development of a \"proper, next stage testing strategy\", adding: \"It may be testing for testing's sake.\"\n\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said trust leaders needed \"clarity\" on the testing regime and how it will be developed.\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast some health workers with symptoms still could not get tested because some testing centres were too far away.\n\n\"If we are going to test [NHS] staff regularly, probably once a week, which we need to do, then our leaders need to know where is that extra capacity going to built, when is it going to be ready, so they can start to make the really quite complex arrangements that need to be made,\" Mr Hopson said.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said testing was \"absolutely critical\" and capacity at NHS and PHE laboratories had more than doubled within weeks.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Alaphilippe said that the hilly terrain gave him an advantage.\n\n\u201cOn this parcourse it was really perfect for me. The first part I went full gas and I just wanted to see what I could do in the second [half],\u201d Alaphilippe said. \u201cIn my ear I hear from my sport director, he said I had the best time.\u201d\n\nAlaphilippe held his yellow jersey and increased his lead in the overall after Friday\u2019s individual time trial in Pau. Photo: Chris Graythen/Getty Images\n\nBelgian Thomas De Gendt (Lotto Soudal) finished third, 35 seconds in arrears, with Rigoberto Uran (EF Education First) and Richie Porte (Trek-Segafredo) rounding out the top-five.\n\nWith his victory, Alaphilippe padded his lead in the Tour de France overall, and now leads Thomas by 1:26. Behind, the individual time trial reshuffled the GC contenders. Egan Bernal slipped from third to fifth place overall, 2:52 down. Steven Kruijswijk (Lotto-Jumbo) advanced from fourth to third. Uran took the biggest step forward, moving up from 12th to 8th place overall, 3:54 down.\n\nWhether Alaphilippe can defend the jersey in the high mountains now becomes the most pressing question of this year\u2019s Tour de France. Alaphilippe has conceded that he lacks the ability of Thomas, Bernal, and the race\u2019s other top grand tour riders in the high mountains.\n\nAfter his win Alaphilippe again downplayed his chances of holding his lead in the Pyrenees.\n\n\u201cOK, we don\u2019t have the team to win the Tour de France\u2014we don\u2019t have a lot of climbers on Deceuninck-Quick Step,\u201d Alaphilippe said. \u201cBut we ride really aggressively and we try to win and I\u2019m just so happy with what happened now.\u201d\n\nAlaphilippe\u2019s victory came after a day of Decuninck-Quick Step dominance on the twisting course. The Belgian team\u2019s powerful Danish domestique Kasper Asgreen set an early fast time of 35:52.52, and sat in the hot seat for much of the day. Asgreen was finally knocked off his perch by De Gendt, whose 35:36.12 set the new fastest time.\n\nDe Gendt dodged multiple bullets as the GC riders all came and went without toppling him from the top of the leader board. Porte was close, and then Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ) also fell just short with 35:49.28, before Uran came within less than a second of the best time.\n\nEventually it was Thomas who set a new fast mark of 35:36.12, however the Welshman\u2019s success was overshadowed in the moment by reports that Alaphilippe was a full seven seconds ahead at the first two time checks. Alaphilippe built on his gap in the course\u2019s flat back half, crossing the line with the fastest time of the day.\n\nAnnouncers revealed a historical wrinkle of Alaphilippe\u2019s victory: he is the first Frenchman to win a Tour de France stage while wearing the yellow jersey since Laurent Fignon did in 1989. And Alaphilippe won the stage on the 100-year anniversary of the first awarding of the yellow jersey at the Tour de France.\n\n\u201cTo be in yellow is already amazing,\u201d Alaphilipp said. \u201cIt\u2019s something for sure I will never forget.

The region is, in some ways, at play for Democrats this election cycle, particularly in a number of Senate contests that are now neck and neck just ahead of Election Day.\n\nDespite the political convention that Republicans hold a secure grip on the South, Democratic candidates are polling competitively in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Texas \u2014 which together account for eight Senate seats and possibly the balance of power in the chamber.\n\nThey could also help usher in additional Electoral College votes for Biden, though many experts remain skeptical whether Democrats can achieve a blue wave.\n\nStill, Georgia races have grown increasingly tight in the past few years, which is why it remains the main target for Democrats. Since losing the state\u2019s race for the governorship by only 50,000 votes, Stacey Abrams and her voter rights organization, Fair Fight, have helped register more than 800,000 new voters in the state.\n\nBy engaging with new voters in the South \u2014 many of them young and minorities \u2014 Democratic candidates hope to find a pathway Nov. 3 in a region often disregarded by their party and increasingly dominated by Republicans in the decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard work over time, and it\u2019s a deep commitment to the noble idea that your vote is your voice and your voice is your human dignity.\u201d Rev.

He worked with Abrams to register those 800,000 voters and noted that 49 percent of them are people of color and 45 percent are under the age of 30.\n\n\u201cThis is not magic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work over time, and it\u2019s a deep commitment to the noble idea that your vote is your voice and your voice is your human dignity.\u201d\n\nSenate races in the South\n\nEarly and absentee voting and donations to the campaigns of this strong class of Southern Democratic candidates would appear to indicate a groundswell of support \u2014 something long considered impossible in the South.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 mail-in ballots and early in-person voting in Kentucky, where former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath is challenging the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have outstripped Republicans by 17 points, according to NBC News\u2019 count. Democrats have out-voted Republicans by 17 percent in North Carolina in early voting, a state where 2.1 million people have already cast their ballots \u2014 a 230 percent increase from this time in 2016. It remains to be seen how these numbers translate on Election Day, as they are inflated by drives to vote early during the pandemic.\n\nAmy McGrath at the Early Vote Cookout at a local restaurant in Louisville, Ky., on Oct. 17, 2020 Jon Cherry / Getty Images\n\nIn South Carolina, however, Democrat Jaime Harrison raised a historic $57 million in a tight race against the incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham. In Texas, Air Force veteran MJ Hegar is polling within a few points of Sen. John Cornyn, the Republican Senate majority whip who has held the seat since 2002. Sen. Doug Jones, the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama since 1988, has outraised his opponent by about $18 million. And in Georgia\u2019s other Senate race, Jon Ossoff appears to be tied with incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue in each new poll released.\n\n\u201cGeorgia becomes younger and more diverse by the hour,\u201d Ossoff said. \u201cAnd the political infrastructure that's been built and invested here in Georgia over the last decade is paying dividends. We've seen record voter registration, we're seeing record turnout and enthusiasm. We're not paying much attention to polls day by day, but the turnout is really encouraging.\u201d\n\nIt is unlikely that Democrats will win all of these seats, but the very fact they are competitive is significant. The chance for a Democratic victory even appears brighter in ruby red Mississippi than it has in decades.\n\nDemocrats in Mississippi had not come within 14 points of this Senate seat since Republicans took official control of it in 1978. That changed in 2018 when Mike Espy, the secretary of agriculture under then-President Bill Clinton, garnered more than 46 percent of the vote in a special election for the seat and lost by 8 points.\n\nSince his comparatively close loss, Espy \u2014 the state\u2019s first Black congressman since Reconstruction \u2014 hopes to benefit from increased turnout during an election year while expanding his voter outreach and fundraising. In the final weeks of October, Espy raised nearly $3.9 million while his opponent, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, the Republican incumbent, pulled in less than $85,000, according to Mississippi Today.\n\nThe math of his campaign, Espy previously told NBC News, is dependent on turning out Black voters, who make up nearly 38 percent of the state\u2019s population, and reaching out to white moderates. The influx of cash appears to be helping.\n\nHe\u2019s polling close with Hyde-Smith and voter turnout could be working in his direction. Hinds County, which is home to a large number of the state\u2019s Black voters, already recorded more than 9,800 early or absentee votes two weeks before the election. In 2016, the county only received 5,309 early or absentee votes for the entire election.\n\nMike Espy and Cindy Hyde-Smith during their televised debate in Jackson, Miss. on Nov. 20, 2018. Rogelio V. Solis / AP file\n\n\u201cThe reason no one won in the South in 25 years is because no one ran,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who has advised Espy\u2019s campaign and helped Jones win his Alabama race in 2017. \u201cYou'd sometimes have a good candidate run, but they had no capacity to raise money or get involvement from the national party. That\u2019s changed now and for the first time in umpteen years, even if you don\u2019t think Joe Biden can win there, voters in these places have a reason to vote.\u201d\n\nHow did the South become competitive?\n\nJones\u2019 success and the intrigue of candidates such as Abrams and Beto O\u2019Rourke in 2018 brought the national gaze to the South in ways it hadn\u2019t before, long after organizers had built up a grassroots movement by themselves.\n\nOrganizers said they took note of a shift in demographics away from white evangelicals, as well as a renewed engagement among young voters in reaction to the Trump administration.\n\nWarnock, the pastor and Senate candidate in Georgia, has worked on voter drives in the state for decades \u2014 even driving Hurricane Katrina refugees back to Louisiana so they could vote. He said the South has long been defined by a \u201cpolitics of fear and the divisions ensconced in the so-called Southern Strategy,\u201d referring to the election strategy used by President Richard Nixon that many believe led to the political realignment of the South by fanning the flames of racism.\n\nLawn signs for Jon Ossoff and Rev.

Elijah Nouvelage / Getty Images\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing is the reversal of that through changing demographics as a result of reverse migration, younger voters are responding to the moment and older voters are seeing how people in Washington are not thinking about them,\u201d he said.\n\nState Democratic parties in the South left their candidates and infrastructure to die on the vine for years under aging leadership. Reform has begun with younger and more diverse organizers taking control in recent years.\n\nIn the past year alone, members of the Mississippi and the Alabama Democratic parties forced out their party heads and ushered in new leadership that made them younger and more diverse than they have been in history.\n\nHoward Dean, a former Democratic presidential candidate, is credited with creating the 50-state strategy in the 2000s, which aimed investment at state parties to have credible candidates compete for every office \u2014 a concept that was never truly realized. He said in recent years \u201cstate parties atrophied for the most part.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s shifting again now,\u201d Dean said, citing Alabama as an example. \u201cA lot of parties that have been weak for a long time are getting stronger.\u201d\n\nThat change began happening despite the lack of investment from the larger party structure, though Dean said the various wings of the Democratic Party are coordinating better than they have in years past\n\nStill, Jones did not receive much support in Alabama until the end of his race in 2017, and Espy drew close in Mississippi without much help in 2018. In contrast, the Democratic National Committee is now funding major ad campaigns in North Carolina, Georgia, Florida and Texas and putting further investment in the races in Kentucky, Mississippi and South Carolina.\n\nRallygoer Gregg Smythe cheers during a drive-in rally for Jaime Harrison on Oct. 17, 2020 in North Charleston, S.C. Cameron Pollack / Getty Images\n\nFor the first time in decades, Democrats in the South have an opportunity, said Clay Middleton, a Black member of the Democratic National Committee who has worked as a political strategist across the South.\n\nThis renewed enthusiasm at the top of each state\u2019s ticket can help each state party rebuild its long-forgotten infrastructure, allows for organizers to update their data, run ads, cycle dollars through local communities and build a bench of new leaders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 38 years old, and I don\u2019t ever recall there being this level of intentional investment into Southern Democratic Party infrastructure,\u201d Middleton said, \u201cwhich means we\u2019re making progress and doing the right things.\u201d\n\nA future for Democrats in the South?\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this is a prolonged shift in Southern politics, or if it is a sudden invigoration caused by a caustic and unpopular president. It is still a deeply conservative and religious region, and some strategists warned that Democrats need to tread carefully.\n\nBrian Walsh, a Republican strategist, said no matter how Democrats do, the GOP will have to reconsider itself as the party of Trump.

It sounded initially a bit Southern, but it's not.\"\n\nThat's fair! The \"-eau\" is definitely a defining characteristic of the Philly accent. To get a better sense of what she's talking about, you can watch the video below, where Miller shows off her pretty-solid take on the accent:\n\nLast year, linguistics expert Dr. Betsy Sneller talked about the Philly accent on a linguistics podcast, where she explained the Philadelphia A:\n\n\"People who speak with the Philadelphia English dialect, Sneller explained, use what\u2019s called a \u201csplit short-a system,\u201d talking about the sound speakers make when they say a word like \u201ctrap.\u201d \"Sneller says Philadelphia English\u2019s version of the split short-a system is one of the most complex in English, so you can flaunt that over anyone who thinks Philadelphians talk funny.\"\n\nMiller said she needed a few words that would help her get into the accent. She used \"poster\" and \"boat\". The way she said these two words was a little dramatic, but we'll let it slide.\n\nIn the film clip Miller played for Fallon's audience, she's a waitress asking Aaron Paul's character about his order. She confirms his order, which is also pretty Philly-area:\n\n\"So, Bud draft with a cheesesteak, fried onions. Ketchup?\"\n\nAaron Paul's character says yes.

So how big a deal is this? The short answer: We don\u2019t entirely know yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat we know\n\nOn December 8, Science reports, scientists and public health experts saw a map that showed an area in southeast England was experiencing an uptick in cases. The genetic analysis of the virus that was spreading there showed that it was unexpectedly different from others that are in circulation elsewhere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere is a concern that the uptick in cases may be because this variant is more transmissible than others. That\u2019s not totally clear yet. But several European countries have now blocked travel in an attempt to keep the new variant out.\n\nAre mutations bad?\n\nNot necessarily. Viruses mutate all the time, and the coronavirus is no exception. Scientists are able to track the spread of the virus in part through sequencing its genome. If two people have COVID, and their viruses are identical or nearly so, they probably got it from the same place. If each of them has a different variant of the virus, they probably got it from different sources. You can see a giant family tree of all the world\u2019s coronavirus mutations here.\n\nSo in this sense, mutations are happening all the time, but so far that really hasn\u2019t changed anything about what the coronavirus is or how we should respond to it.\n\nIs this mutation worse than the others?\n\nIt\u2019s too early to say. The new variant, called B.1.1.7, is now being studied to determine whether it\u2019s different from other coronaviruses in any important ways. Maybe it\u2019s more transmissible than others. We don\u2019t have proof of that yet, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill it be able to evade the vaccine?\n\nAgain, we don\u2019t know yet. B.1.1.7 has 17 places where its genome is different from its close relatives. About half of those are in the spike protein, which is worrying.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow mRNA Vaccines Work The first COVID vaccine to be rolled out in the U.S., the one from Pfizer and BioNTech, is an mRNA\u2026 Read more\n\nThe mRNA vaccines that just rolled out cause our bodies to make the spike protein, and then our immune systems respond to that protein and prepare to recognize any future invaders that carry the same protein.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn theory, changes in the spike protein might allow it to evade the vaccine. But that depends on the specifics of exactly how different the new spike protein is, and whether our immune systems can still recognize it. We simply don\u2019t have an answer to this question yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf it really is more transmissible, how can we stop it?\n\nThe new variant has been circulating in England since at least September 20, so it\u2019s unlikely that closing borders now will completely stop it from spreading. Chances are, the variant has already made it to other countries. But these restrictions may, at least, reduce the number of people with the new variant who enter those countries .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOtherwise, we should continue our efforts\u2014c ontaining a highly transmissible coronavirus is exactly what we\u2019ve been trying to do all along, isn\u2019t it? Masks and distancing and ventilation would still matter, if this new variant comes into play ; they would just matter more.\n\nTrevor Bedford, a scientist who studies virus mutation, noted on Twitter that the UK mutation \u201cdeserves close attention,\u201d but that it was unlikely to interfere too much with a vaccine rollout. Most of the viruses circulating have no significant mutations in their spike proteins. If one of the variants becomes more common, and turns out to be able to evade the vaccine, we\u2019ll need to update the vaccine accordingly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRemember, there is no conclusive evidence that it\u2019s less responsive to the vaccine or that it causes more severe disease. It also seems to be more transmissible, but that question hasn\u2019t been very well studied yet. The experts who are discussing the UK variant seem to be keeping a careful eye on it, but they don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to panic.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.Destructoid.com/stories/strap-in-it-s-time-to-watch-ea-play-live-2020-594754.phtml", "authors": [], "title": "Strap in, it's time to watch EA Play Live 2020", "text": "The real EA Play is the friends we made along the way\n\nNo E3, no problem.

(On behalf of all boys, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know why we\u2019re like this.) And Nini didn\u2019t just move on with any ol\u2019 guy; she\u2019s now dating E.J. (Matt Cornett), a real-life Troy Bolton with the voice of an angel and the jawline of a Disney prince.\n\nWhen East High\u2019s new theater director \u2014 a delightful ball of insanity named Miss Jenn (Kate Reinders) \u2014 announces that the school\u2019s next production will be High School Musical\u2026 The Musical, Ricky seizes his opportunity to win Nini back. His audition gets off to a rough start, but when he picks up his guitar and the words start flowing, you could hear a pin drop in that auditorium. (As an added emotional gut punch, he auditions with the song Nini once wrote to express how she felt about him. So he\u2019s not totally hopeless.)\n\nGasps abound when the cast list is posted, and rightfully so. Not only does Nini beat out new-girl Gina (Sofia Wylie) for the role of Gabriella, but Ricky also manages to land the part of Troy, much to the dismay of E.J., who\u2019s forced to serve as Ricky\u2019s understudy. As the show\u2019s stage manager puts its so eloquently, \u201cBuckle up, Wildcats. S\u2013t\u2019s about to get real.\u201d\n\nTVLine spoke with executive producer Tim Federle about bringing HSM:TM:TS to life, as well as what we can expect from the rest of the first season\u2026 and beyond:\n\nTVLINE | When I first heard that this show was being done as a mockumentary, I had my doubts. But now that I\u2019ve seen it, I feel like it couldn\u2019t have been done any other way.\n\nThe other way would have been a straight-up reboot, or a fourth movie. And while I get the fantasy of all that, I don\u2019t know the real world [possibility] of getting them all those actors back together. I\u2019m a Broadway guy, and I have a language for taking original material and doing it in a new way. That\u2019s just how theater treats stuff. And I love the original songs. They\u2019re still bops. But it\u2019s fun to hear them reimagined in new ways. It\u2019s also an opportunity to get a whole bunch of new songs out there. So it\u2019s been a blast.\n\nTVLINE | The original movie also takes itself so seriously. Thirteen years later, I\u2019m not sure that same tone would have worked.\n\nYes, and we took the mockumentary approach \u2014 because I grew up with Waiting for Guffman and The Office, which are such cultural touchstones \u2014 so that we could look at the camera and say, \u201cWe know this is a little ridiculous,\u201d which felt important.\n\nTVLINE | That said, the musical numbers, at least in the premiere, are pretty earnest. Did you specifically want them to feel separate from the rest of the show, stylistically?\n\nWe do a variety of different musical conceits. Later in the season, we have a full fantasy number, which features a cameo from an original cast member. But we also have super grounded songs. We\u2019ve got these actors \u2014 like Joshua and Olivia \u2014 who play their own instruments and sing the songs live without autotune. I hope that level of authenticity reaches an audience that\u2019s so used to Tik Tok-ing their own lives, and that they\u2019ll know the real thing when they see it.\n\nTVLINE | Are you predicting that fans will take sides between Ricky and E.J.?\n\nI think there will be some Team Ricky and Team E.J. But beyond the premiere, E.J. does some really stupid, high school boy things that feel a little irredeemable. Team Ricky is the obvious one, but I think a number of people will tune in for E.J., too.\n\nTVLINE | Given that this show is about musical theater, I appreciated the level of LGBT representation, from Nini\u2019s moms to characters like Carlos and Seb. A lot was suggested, but will any characters actually talk about being gay as the show progresses?\n\nIf you stick with the series long enough, you\u2019ll see [Carlos and Seb\u2019s] relationship grow into something that I think is both highly relatable and maybe a little bit new for Disney. With the Disney+ of it all, there was a sense of \u201cLet\u2019s swing big and take risks.\u201d At no point did anyone [from Disney Channel or Disney+] tell me, \u201cPlease cut this joke that makes fun of Disney or Zac Efron.\u201d Or, \u201cPlease cut this serious moment that hints at a level of authenticity and diversity that we all know exists in the real world.\u201d I think we push boundaries, while always keeping in mind that we want the show to appeal to a broad audience, including moms who can watch it in a co-viewing experience with their kids. Sometimes we take baby steps, and sometimes we take leaping jumps.\n\nTVLINE | Looking back on the original movies, the fact that Ryan \u2014 who was so clearly gay \u2014 ended up with Kelsey felt like such a tragedy.\n\nI wasn\u2019t there at the time, and I understand the challenges of trying to appeal to as broad an audience as possible without riling people up. I don\u2019t feel that my show is trying to make up for anything that wasn\u2019t there before, but I do think it\u2019s a new generation, and having a cast full of 15, 16 and 17-year-olds, I\u2019m aware that I can\u2019t put anything in there that they\u2019re going to roll their eyes at. They\u2019re real teens living real lives.\n\nTVLINE | And you\u2019ve already been picked up for Season 2, which is exciting. I understand the plan, though, is not to do High School Musical 2 next year?\n\nRight, it\u2019s going to be a different musical. We\u2019re circling a title right now that I\u2019m really excited about. It\u2019s definitely outside of the Troy and Gabriella world. At the end of the day, it\u2019s going for something that\u2019ll be escapist for people.\n\nYour thoughts on High School Musical: The Musical: The Series?

He loses nothing in defeat, Undisputed Era looks even more dastardly and dominant, and the brand has a heel act it can continue to build around.\n\nFor Strong personally, this is the culmination of an underrated run that has produced some of NXT's finest matches.

Nine other people across the three families later got sick.\n\nThe researchers described their findings in an early-release letter published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases earlier this month.\n\nIt's a frightening prospect for people who are trying to keep a healthy distance from others.

And one in five US restaurants could close permanently because of the pandemic, according to a UBS estimate.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association this week asked Congress for $240 billion to help the struggling industry.\n\nWhile most Americans have indicated they want to wait before resuming their daily routines, opening up restaurants means reopening a supply chain for restaurateurs, farmers, produce sellers, cooks, and servers.\n\nRestaurants will need new rules when they reopen, but it could vary by state\n\nThe researchers who studied the outbreak at the Guangzhou restaurant did not replicate the phenomenon in a lab, and they don't have other cases to compare it to, so their findings have to be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nBut William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University, said the research letter was a good resource to help us understand what restaurant reopenings would look like.\n\n\"We are going to open back up,\" Schaffner said. \"But the trick will be to open slowly, do it in a phased fashion,\" he said, including \"opening restaurants and doing so at half-capacity, spacing out the seats.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether spacing and capacity rules could do the trick, though it's highly likely they will be employed anyway \u2014 and we could start to see rural areas, which generally haven't been hit as hard by the virus as cities, try them first.\n\nSchaffner, who lives in Tennessee, which had about 7,300 coronavirus cases as of Tuesday, said he had seen the mounting pressure for restaurants to reopen.\n\nJennifer Horney, the founding director of the University of Delaware's epidemiology program, told Business Insider that she foresees a slow relaxation of states' or regions' emergency orders, allowing restaurants to reopen with some tweaks to traditional service. Eating out in a state with relaxed guidelines might include paying through touchless methods, using disposable menus, and seeing staff members wearing face masks and gloves.\n\nScientists say restaurants should reduce capacity when they reopen, but it may be a hard rule to enforce\n\nHorney said that rather than creating restrictions, such as banning air conditioning or outdoor dining, restaurants might find it easier and just as effective to adapt existing rules, such as those about room capacity.\n\n\"Existing regulations, like fire-code occupancy numbers, could be used to set a maximum number, like 25% of usual occupancy, that could be safely served at any time,\" Horney said.\n\nBut Schaffner was skeptical about how to ensure that restaurants adhere to capacity rules.\n\n\"Some restaurants will say, 'Listen, we're getting a lot of business. Let's just open up a few more tables. The COVID police are not going to catch us tonight,'\" he said.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://nypost.com/2020/12/16/hiker-dies-after-80-foot-fall-at-grand-canyon-national-park/", "authors": ["December"], "title": "Hiker dies after 80-foot fall at Grand Canyon National Park", "text": "A 23-year-old Arizona man died after plunging 80 feet off a trail at the Grand Canyon, authorities said.\n\nJaiquan Carter, of Phoenix, was hiking along the South Kaibab Trail above the Black Bridge at the famed national park early Tuesday when he fell to his death, the National Park Service said.\n\nPark officials said they were notified of Carter\u2019s death around 7:40 a.m.\n\nThe park service and Coconino County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office are investigating the incident but no further details are currently available.\n\nAccording to mygrandcanyonpark.com, about a dozen people die at the park every year.\n\nIn July, a 59-year-old Arizona woman fell to her death while trying to snap a photo at the park.\n\nIn June, a California woman died after collapsing in 114-degree teat at the canyon.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nina-kapur-cbs-new-york-reporter-dies-moped-crash/", "authors": [], "title": "CBS New York reporter Nina Kapur dies after moped crash", "text": "CBS New York reporter Nina Kapur has died.

A straight-line extrapolation from this week\u2019s results has Trump significantly weaker than when he carried North Carolina\u2019s 15 electoral votes, 50-46%. That\u2019s good news for Democrats.\n\nActually, I think there is cautionary news \u2014 yellow lights \u2014 for both parties in results in a district that happens to include affluent suburbs, somewhat less affluent exurbs, and rural and small town areas in approximately equal numbers. Some 35% of votes were cast in the district\u2019s portion of Mecklenburg County (affluent Charlotte and close-in suburbs), 32% in exurban Union County to the east, and 33% in the smaller counties farther east, extending to Fayetteville, home of Fort Bragg, and Robeson County, whose population is 39% Lumbee Indian, 26% white, 24% black, 9% Hispanic, and 1% Asian.\n\n(On how Trump carried the Lumbees, check out the reporting of the Washington Examiner\u2019s Dan Allott.)\n\nOne way to gauge attitudes in the different areas is to look at each of these three areas and compare the 2019 results with those of the 2016 congressional race, in which Republican Rob Pittenger won over a noncompetitive Democrat 58-42%. Pittenger\u2019s lost the 2018 Republican primary, and the Republican nominee\u2019s narrow lead in November was voided because of apparent election fraud by a Republican operative.\n\nIn upscale Mecklenburg County, even though Bishop represented part of the area in the state Senate, he lost 43-56%. That\u2019s a big contrast with Pittenger\u2019s 2016 margin there, when he won the area 58-42%. This is cautionary news for Republicans: Trump continues to cost them many traditional Republican votes in the upscale portions of large metropolitan areas. As Cook Political Report House analyst David Wasserman tweeted: \u201cLast night makes it clear: there\u2019s a five-alarm fire for Trump in Whole Foods suburbs.\u201d\n\nExurban Union County, in contrast, remained Republican, but by a reduced margin. It gave Bishop a 21-point margin, and a popular vote margin bigger than McCready\u2019s in Mecklenburg. But Pittenger had done much better there, winning 68-32%. This is cautionary news for both parties. Exurban areas remain Republican, but not by margins as large as before the Trump presidency.\n\nThe rural counties seemed to vote exactly the same in the 2019 and 2016 congressional races. There\u2019s a strong Democratic tradition, going back to the Civil War, as you head eastward from Union County. Bishop lost these counties 49.5-49.9% this year; Pittenger had lost them 49.9-50.1% in 2016. Despite this similarity, I see three cautionary notes for Democrats here.\n\nOne is that this is the part of the district with the highest percentage of racial minorities, particularly in Robeson County, which gave the Democrat only a 1.1-point margin. Far from being poison with racial minorities, the Trump brand may be an elixir. Black and other minority voters may be noticing the all-time (since statistics started in 1972) low black unemployment numbers.\n\nThe other note is that turnout in the rural areas in this special election was especially light. Turnout as compared to the 2016 presidential year House race was down 38% in affluent Mecklenburg, 41% in exurban Union, and 49% in the rural counties. That suggests that there\u2019s more room for increased turnout in the rural areas, and the Trump campaign seems to be moving on this more than the Democrats so far.\n\nWhich leads to the third cautionary note for Democrats. Bishop was clearly identified with Trump in all three regions, especially in Mecklenburg County, where he lost areas he had been carrying as a state senator. In contrast, Democrat McCready could run as a moderate, fashioning his positions on issues to local sensibilities and not being stuck with unpopular stands like those taken by many Democratic presidential candidates this year.\n\nBut the Democratic nominee, whoever it is, will be. Consider another post-election David Wasserman tweet: McCready\u2019s \u201cpoor showing among rural Trump Dems (yes, they\u2019re a real constituency) cost Dems a pickup. And frankly, it\u2019s easy to see a very liberal, coastal Dem presidential nominee performing much worse than McCready (D) and Clinton among these voters. Dems underestimate how much room there still is to fall with these anti-elite voters at their own peril.\u201d\n\nSo, yellow lights facing those on both roads on the intersection.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/president-trump-looks-foreign-policy-wins-ahead-u-s-election-n1244068", "authors": ["Dan De Luce", "Dan De Luce Is A Reporter For The Nbc News Investigative Unit.", "Abigail Williams", "Abigail Williams Is A Producer", "Reporter For Nbc News Covering The State Department."], "title": "President Trump looks for foreign policy wins ahead of U.S. election", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Trump administration officials are making a last-ditch effort to salvage an arms control agreement with Russia, part of a wider push by President Donald Trump to score foreign policy breakthroughs as he campaigns for re-election.\n\nThe United States and Russia inched closer to an arms control deal Tuesday after Moscow said it would support a Trump administration proposal to freeze nuclear warheads for a year and extend the last major nuclear arms control treaty between the two powers, known as New START.\n\nAs polls show Trump trailing his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, the president's deputies are engaged in high-stakes diplomacy as they try to score foreign policy wins before the Nov. 3 election. The efforts include trying to forge an arms control deal with Russia, persuading more Arab states to normalize relations with Israel, securing the release of detained Americans in Syria and pulling more U.S. troops out of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\"The peculiar timing, combined with the hard push for immediate action, strongly suggests that these initiatives are disproportionately driven by the U.S. electoral calendar rather than our national security interests,\" said William Wechsler of the Atlantic Council think tank, who worked as a senior defense official in the Obama administration.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nNBC News has reported that Trump is considering a sweeping foreign policy speech before the election, pressing members of his national security team to accelerate key initiatives that he could highlight, such as a U.S. troop withdrawal in Afghanistan, according to two senior administration officials.\n\nIn a statement, a senior administration official said: \"From day one, this administration has relentlessly pursued stronger arms control, brokered peace, and fought to bring American hostages home, all of which have strengthened U.S. national security. No one should be surprised that we continue to aggressively push forward in these efforts regardless of the domestic political calendar.\"\n\nThe potential breakthrough with Russia came only days after a public spat that left arms control negotiations between Washington and Moscow in a stalemate. On Friday, the Trump administration rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to renew the New START treaty for a year without conditions, calling an extension in which neither side freezes its nuclear warheads a \"non-starter.\"\n\nBy Tuesday, Russia said it would accept U.S. demands for a mutual freeze of nuclear arsenals, although it stopped short of agreeing to verifying any freeze.\n\n\"Our proposal can only and exclusively be implemented on the understanding that the United States will not advance any additional conditions,\" Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement, referring to the freeze as a \"political obligation.\"\n\nThe Trump administration welcomed Russia's statement and said it was prepared to meet immediately to \"finalize a verifiable agreement.\"\n\nJames Acton, a senior fellow who is co-director of the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that a deal is possible but that it is unclear whether an agreement is close.\n\n\"A disagreement over whether verification is needed is pretty significant,\" Acton said. If the U.S. \"wants a deal before the election, then either the U.S. will have to back down and accept no verification or the U.S. will have to accept a Russian promise to negotiate verification arrangements, since it's not possible to do so in two weeks. Both are possibilities. Both are far from assured.\"\n\nThe 2010 treaty, which is set to expire Feb. 5, is the last agreement between the U.S. and Russia limiting the growth of the world's two largest nuclear arsenals following Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, both countries can actively deploy no more than 1,550 active nuclear warheads, whether attached to intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarines or aircraft. The agreement includes specific verification measures, allowing each country to frequently inspect the other's arsenal to ensure that the rules are being followed.\n\nThe Trump administration's stance on the arms control treaty has shifted dramatically in recent months, taking on a new urgency after three years of gridlock. Initially, the administration had insisted that any future deal must include China, a demand that Moscow and Beijing both rejected. U.S. officials also had said verification requirements would be strengthened under a renewal of New START.\n\n\"We're at the eleventh-and-a-half hour here,\" said Kingston Reif, director of disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association think tank. \"The administration had more than 3\u00bd years to pursue an agreement with Russia.\"\n\nMatthew Kroenig, a former senior defense official who advised Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign, said the timing of the diplomatic push so close to the presidential election was no coincidence.\n\n\"Part of the rush is to get something before November 3rd to say we got a deal with the Russians that's better than what Obama got,\" Kroenig said.\n\nThe Trump administration has also ramped up its efforts to secure the release of several U.S. citizens held in Syria, meeting with Syrian and Lebanese officials in hope of bringing the Americans home. Among the Americans are freelance journalist Austin Tice, a former Marine who disappeared in Syria in 2012, and Majd Kamalmaz, a Syrian American therapist who has been missing since 2017, when he was stopped at a government checkpoint.\n\nA line of U.S. military vehicles in Syria's northern city of Manbij on Dec. 30, 2018. Delil Souleiman / AFP - Getty Images file\n\nA National Security Council official led a U.S. delegation to Syria in August for secret negotiations to secure their return, according to two Trump administration officials briefed about the discussions.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which first reported the meetings, identified the officials as Kash Patel, a deputy assistant to Trump, and the U.S. special envoy for hostage affairs, Ambassador Roger Carstens, who met with Ali Mamlouk, the head of Syria's intelligence agency, in his office in Damascus.\n\nNational security adviser Robert O'Brien also met with Lebanon's security chief, Gen. Abbas Ibrahim, last week in Washington, according to the two administration officials.\n\nThe prospects for the Damascus talks remained an open question. Syrian demands in connection with the release of the Americans ranged from lifting a broad array of U.S. sanctions to a full U.S. troop withdrawal, according to the U.S. officials.\n\nLast week, Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen released two Americans. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the release was \"the latest affirmation that President Trump remains committed to bringing every American held hostage or wrongfully detained abroad back home.\"\n\nTrump and his supporters have pointed to recent normalization agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and between Israel and Bahrain as milestones in foreign policy. Even the president's critics \u2014 including Biden \u2014 have praised the deals as important steps forward for the Middle East.\n\nWechsler called the so-called Abraham Accords \"a real foreign policy accomplishment any way that you cut it.\"\n\nBut even when Trump has scored a success in the international arena, he tends to overshadow the news with controversial comments and tweets that shift public attention to other issues and partisan feuds, experts say. In any case, political analysts say the president's handling of the coronavirus, race relations and the economy are likely to shape voters' decisions, not foreign policy issues.\n\nAs he faced a difficult re-election bid in 1980, President Jimmy Carter and his deputies scrambled to try to win the release of Americans held hostage in Iran. The Americans were not released, and Carter lost in a rout to Ronald Reagan. In October 1972, just before the presidential election, President Richard Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, declared that \"peace is at hand\" in Vietnam, which turned out not to be the case.\n\nMost presidents seeking four more years try to point to their achievements in the closing weeks of the campaign, not secure last-minute breakthroughs, Wechsler said.\n\n\"At this point in the election cycle, what you typically see is a president reminding the public of all the successes he's had over the years,\" Wechsler said. \"What you don't typically see is a president trying to have new successes because his track record is seen as lacking.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.autoevolution.com/news/daimler-fined-eur870-million-on-emissions-investigation-137729.html", "authors": ["Daniel Patrascu"], "title": "Daimler Fined EUR870 Million on Emissions Investigation", "text": "The story began in 2017, when German prosecutors started looking into Daimler\u2019s alleged habit of cheating emissions tests.

Over the years, these processors have become more advanced and full-fledged, gaining the ability to process much more data at once. This is what has lead to many of the advancements we\u2019ve seen in smartphone camera quality in recent years.\n\nLast year, the Spectra 480 ISP in Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 865 broke the two-gigapixel barrier. That is, it had the ability to process two billion pixels in one second, unlocking some pretty incredible features in smartphone cameras.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: The top Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 features you need to know\n\nProcessing that much data at once allowed support for 200MP image capture, 8K video recording, and semantic segmentation for better AI photo enhancement, among other things. With a 40% jump in overall speed, it was a pretty massive upgrade over the Spectra 380 found in the Snapdragon 855.\n\nThis year, Qualcomm is looking to trump last year\u2019s ISP in a big way, touting 35% faster performance with its new processor, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. But what is Qualcomm doing with 2.7 gigapixels of throughput? Android Authority had the opportunity to talk to Judd Heape, VP of Product Management for Camera at Qualcomm to find out.\n\nThree cameras at once\n\nCredit: Qualcomm\n\nOne of the biggest changes coming to Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 888 is the addition of a third image signal processor. Since the Spectra ISP was first introduced, previous Snapdragon SoCs packed two of them. That meant smartphones using Qualcomm\u2019s chips could record with two cameras at the same time, but it also meant Qualcomm could have much higher throughput to a single camera. The company\u2019s switch to processing four pixels at once in the Snapdragon 865 is what allowed for the massive 40% performance gain in its last generation ISP. This year, however, Qualcomm is taking a simpler approach: volume.\n\nRead more: Snapdragon SoC guide \u2014 all of Qualcomm\u2019s smartphone processors explained\n\nWith the Snapdragon 888, the company is adding another image signal processor to its SoC. That brings the total to three for the first time in a Qualcomm chip. This unlocks a slew of new features, but one of the most interesting is support for recording with three cameras at once. Considering many flagship smartphones now have at least three rear cameras, the third ISP allows users to record three focal lengths at the same time, up to 4K 10-bit video at 30fps. If you\u2019re recording a scene and want to jump between three different focal lengths while editing, the Snapdragon 888 has support for that. OEMs will have to implement it into their devices, however.\n\nUsing three ISP\u2019s also unlocks improvements in smartphone camera zoom. Last year\u2019s Snapdragon 865 enabled smooth zoom between sensors, giving the impression that you were using a single telephoto zoom and not three separate lenses. But with just two ISPs, it wasn\u2019t so easy for the chipmaker to know which lens you were going to switch to at any given time.\n\n\u201cBefore, we had to guess which lens you were going to switch to,\u201d says Judd Heape, VP of Product Management for Camera at Qualcomm. \u201cNow, we don\u2019t have to anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile you would generally see a smooth zoom between lenses, there could often be a delay when switching one ISP to another sensor if you swapped focal lengths unexpectedly. With three ISP\u2019s, Qualcomm can have all three sensors active at once, assuming your smartphone only has three rear cameras.\n\nSuper-fast capture and playback\n\nCredit: David Imel / Android Authority\n\nWhile devices running the Snapdragon 888 can capture three 10-bit 4k HDR video streams at 30fps due to that third ISP, Qualcomm considered what would happen if it funneled all that throughput into one place. After all, many modern smartphones have 90Hz, 120Hz, and even 144Hz displays. Shouldn\u2019t you be able to record video at the same rate?\n\nWith three Spectra 580 ISPs in the Snapdragon 888, the chip can achieve 2.7Gpix/sec (gigapixels per second) of throughput. With this much data, Qualcomm can capture and playback a single video stream at 4K 120fps. This means if you have a smartphone with a 120Hz display, you\u2019ll be able to capture and view video at the frame rate of your display. If you thought 60fps video was smooth, this is the next step forward.\n\nNow that so many smartphones have high refresh rate displays, we thought it would be great to capture and view video at that rate. Judd Heape\n\nOf course, just like HDR 10 and Dolby HDR video, both the device you watch the video on and the viewing platform have to support 120fps playback. Currently, YouTube only supports playback of 4K video at up to 60fps, for example. If you share directly to another device, that device will also need to have a 120Hz display to experience the video how it was captured. Fortunately, the more popular the format gets, the more likely devices and hosing services will support it.\n\nComputational HDR video\n\nCredit: David Imel / Android Authority\n\nWhile smartphone cameras can now produce photos with an astounding dynamic range due to HDR processing, smartphone video generally hasn\u2019t benefited from the same improvements. In fact, this is a big reason the Google Pixel 5\u2019s video recording isn\u2019t nearly as good as its photo capabilities. While computational photography has seen rapid development in the last few years, video has generally remained an afterthought.\n\nNow, Qualcomm is hoping to change that with staggered HDR video recording. First, I should note that staggered HDR is much different from the likes of HDR 10 and Dolby HDR video. While those are standards defining the brightness of a display and how much color detail can be captured in highlight and shadow areas, staggered HDR video aims to achieve much the same goal as HDR photos. It uses multi-exposure processing to retain as much highlight and shadow detail as possible.\n\nStaggered HDR video is a huge leap forward.\n\nStaggered HDR video captures multiple exposures for each frame, each at a different shutter speed. Because of this, the sensor can retain detail in both the highlight and shadow areas, then fuse exposures to achieve a more balanced video stream. Heape tells me the Snapdragon 888 can theoretically do this at 60fps, capturing 120 frames in one second. However, he\u2019s opting to recommend 30fps Computational HDR recording to most OEMs for now.\n\nCurrently, the Snapdragon 888 will fuse two exposures per frame, but Heape didn\u2019t rule out three or more exposures per frame coming in future Snapdragon models for even better dynamic range.\n\n\u201cWe could certainly see three or more exposures per frame in the future,\u201d says Heape. \u201cThat\u2019s definitely not out of the question.\u201d\n\n84MP images with zero shutter lag\n\nCredit: David Imel / Android Authority\n\nOn smartphones, capturing a video is nearly the same as displaying a constant stream from the camera to your display. The only difference is actually storing these images. Even so, most smartphones will still temporarily store frames in RAM to capture the moments before, during, and after you press the shutter button. This is the technology that enables things like HDR photos, live photos, and so on.\n\nLast year, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 unlocked the ability to display and capture 64MP images with zero shutter lag. This meant a smartphone running the chip was able to display a 64MP image stream at 30fps and have no lag or blackout between tapping the shutter and storing the image in memory. Now you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cWait a minute, if it only had support for 64MP images, how did phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra capture 108MP photos?\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what Heape had to say:\n\nFor phones running the Snapdragon 865, 108MP images were actually previewed at 1/4 resolution. When the user tapped the shutter button, the sensor would switch to 108MP mode for one frame, dump that frame into memory, and resume displaying the scene at 1/4 resolution. Because of this, Qualcomm does not consider 108MP images to have zero shutter lag.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any image sensor, MIPI PHY interface, or ISP that can truly run at 108MP at 30fps (3.2Gpix/sec) in ZSL mode today,\u201d continued Heape. \u201cBut don\u2019t rule that out for the future.\u201d\n\nThat said, the 35% speed increase in the Snapdragon 888 ISP has unlocked 84MP images with zero shutter lag. This means users will see the full resolution image before they tap the shutter button, up to 84MP. While the Snapdragon 888 hasn\u2019t quite hit the 3.2Gpix/sec quota it needs to display 108MP images in full resolution, improvements in the last two generations make 108MP ZSL images look promising for the near future.\n\nSmarter autofocus\n\nCredit: David Imel / Android Authority\n\nIn the Snapdragon 888, Qualcomm set out to improve what it calls \u201cthe three A\u2019s.\u201d Those are auto exposure, auto white balance, and autofocus. To do this, the company used machine learning on an enormous set of images to train the Snapdragon 888 on what an image should look like in a given circumstance. Yet, in the case of autofocus, Qualcomm went even further. It trained the chip using real people.\n\nWe used AI and machine learning to train auto exposure, white balance and autofocus,\u201d says Heape. \u201cBut in the case of autofocus, we used real people.\u201d\n\nSee also: The best Android camera phones you can get\n\nQualcomm used VR headsets with eye-tracking technology to track where a human looked when presented with a given image. Even if an object is in the foreground, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the subject of the photo. Humans are quite good at distinguishing the true subject in a given scene, so training the chip using people\u2019s eye movements allows the Snapdragon 888 to focus on the true subject with much higher precision. Qualcomm says they used hundreds of subjects and thousands of images to create this data set. It should hopefully improve even further in future Snapdragon models.\n\nBetter autofocus alongside multi-frame noise reduction and Qualcomm\u2019s HDR engine also allows sensors to do something smartphones haven\u2019t done before \u2014 focus at just .1 lux of brightness. While previous devices would get confused and couldn\u2019t operate effectively at this extreme level of darkness, Qualcomm is confident its new low-light architecture can achieve this.\n\nThere are even more camera improvements coming to devices running the Snapdragon 888. However, many of those changes have to do with other components like the Hexagon AI engine. A third ISP alone has given Qualcomm a massive leap in processing capabilities in the Snapdragon 888, and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll see similar improvements in future Snapdragon generations.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/29/us/george-floyd-new-video-officers-kneel-trnd/index.html", "authors": ["Paul P.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at what\u2019s really worrying prospective investors\u2014and why an IPO could still work out.\n\nThe rise of shared office space is emblematic of the Millennial generation\u2019s considerable influence on the world. Mindful, social, and sleekly designed, it\u2019s\u2014of course\u2014also the impetus of a much-hyped IPO.\n\nUnfortunately, we all know what happens when the buildup to an IPO leads to disappointment. Investors run for the hills, and analysts unleash their harshest critiques. We\u2019re seeing this happen in real time as the WeWork IPO bites the dust.\n\nWhy the WeWork IPO didn\u2019t work\u2014at least not yet\n\nEvidently, investor sentiment was lukewarm. WeWork\u2019s minimum target for its IPO was $3 billion. Japan\u2019s SoftBank (SFTBY) reportedly may have been prepared to buy up to $1 billion worth of WeWork shares. But even with this offer of assistance, WeWork still would have fallen short of its objective.\n\nIn addition to the funding shortfall, there may be issues with corporate governance. Some prospective investors might feel that Adam Neumann, WeWork\u2019s co-founder and CEO, has too much influence within the company. Responding to this latter concern, The We Company has stated that it\u2019s making changes \u201cin response to market feedback.\u201d In particular:\n\nNeumann\u2019s superior voting shares will decrease from 20 votes per share to ten.\n\nHe will give the company any profit he receives from real estate deals he\u2019s entered with The We Company.\n\nHe\u2019ll limit his ability to sell shares in the second and third years after the IPO to no more than 10% of his stock.\n\nNo member of Neumann\u2019s family will be on the company\u2019s board, and the board will select any successor.\n\nWhat investors are really worried about with WeWork\n\nWhen we learn a little bit more about Neumann, I think investors\u2019 concerns come into sharper focus. Much like Tesla (TSLA) with Elon Musk, WeWork has a young-ish, visionary, outspoken, and perhaps somewhat eccentric leader who\u2019s known for maintaining absolute control over the company.\n\nIn other words, prospective investors are concerned that Adam Neumann\u2014a 40-year-old, Israeli-born serial entrepreneur whose stated mission is \u201cto elevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d\u2014will end up being another Elon Musk. Tesla\u2019s CEO is a smart guy, no doubt. But he\u2019s also a bit of a loose cannon, and he\u2019s known for making a faux pas or two (or more).\n\nLet\u2019s face it: Tesla isn\u2019t the only electric vehicle company out there. Nio (NIO) and other upstarts are gaining market share in the EV space. Yet Tesla has what its competitors don\u2019t: a flamboyant, charismatic leader who knows how to leverage his cult of personality and grab headlines.\n\nI guess you could say it\u2019s a gift and a curse at the same time. Not every investor has the stomach for controversial CEOs or a mini-Musk in the form of Adam Neumann. I understand this concern. But who among us doesn\u2019t wish they\u2019d stockpiled TSLA shares during the Tesla IPO?\n\nWe can make it work\n\nBesides, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) had been tapped to underwrite The We Company\u2019s IPO. Those are highly sophisticated financiers that thoroughly research each and every investment. They don\u2019t throw their money away on junk. Clearly, they saw the potential in WeWork and, therefore, in Adam Neumann\u2019s leadership.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think it\u2019s chiefly a funding issue, even if that\u2019s what the financial pundits have chosen to focus on. They also complained that WeWork pulled the plug on its IPO at the last minute. But I respect that decision because if WeWork is going to go public, The We Company should do it right or not do it at all.\n\nIn any case, this isn\u2019t the end of the story\u2014not even close. WeWork\u2019s official statement is that they\u2019re \u201clooking forward to [the] upcoming IPO,\u201d which they \u201cexpect to be completed by the end of the year.\u201d I\u2019m looking forward to it, too. Hopefully, by then, investors and analysts will say, \u201cGood work, WeWork.\u201d\n\nAs of this writing, David Moadel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://boingboing.net/2020/02/29/use-this-language-learning-app.html", "authors": [], "title": "Use this language-learning app to speak like a local when you travel", "text": "Use this language-learning app to speak like a local when you travel\n\nHow many times have you struggled to order street food or get public transportation directions while traveling abroad?

I was 56 at the time and when I went into the Social Security office to notify them of his death I was told I would be able to get a partial draw when I turned 60. Two years after that I was told that I would never draw anything from his account as the rules had been changed, and since he had never drawn Social Security that his benefits were eliminated. I am 62 and intend to keep working but any information you have might be helpful.\n\nSigned: Confused Survivor\n\nDear Confused Survivor: You\u2019ve certainly been given some conflicting information, so I\u2019ll try to clarify. If your husband had accumulated enough quarter credits to be eligible for Social Security, you are eligible for a survivor benefit even if your husband was not yet collecting Social Security (SS) benefits when he passed. To be eligible for SS, your husband would have needed to work for about 10 years for an employer which participated in Social Security program (meaning, both your husband and his employer paid SS FICA payroll taxes on his earnings). Most U.S. employers participate in the Social Security program. However, if your husband worked his entire career as an employee of a state or local government which does not participate in SS, or if he worked for the Federal government under their \u201cCSRS\u201d program, or if he worked for any other entity which didn\u2019t participate in Social Security, he may not have had enough SS credits to be eligible. But if he contributed to Social Security for at least 10 years and had at least 40 credits (can earn 4 per year) then he would have been eligible for SS, and you would be eligible for a survivor benefit from his record.\n\nThe rules haven\u2019t changed for any of this. If your husband was at least eligible for SS (not necessarily collecting), you became eligible for a survivor benefit at age 60 although it would have been reduced by about 28.5% from what you would get at your full retirement age (FRA). You are still eligible for the survivor benefit but, if you take it now at age 62, it will still be reduced for claiming before your FRA, and since you are still working you\u2019ll also be subject to Social Security\u2019s earnings limit ($17,640 for 2019). If you exceed the earnings limit, SS will withhold from future benefits $1 for every $2 you are over the limit, which would mean you wouldn\u2019t get benefits for some months until they recover what is due. If your current earnings are high, it may not be prudent to claim early SS benefits even if you\u2019re entitled to them. The earnings limit changes annually, is considerably higher (by 2.5 times) in the year you reach your FRA and goes away once your reach your full retirement age.\n\nFor your awareness, the survivor benefit reaches the maximum amount when you reach your full retirement age (but is reduced if you claim it earlier). You have the option to restrict your claim to survivor benefits only, and you may want to do this if your own SS benefit from your lifetime earnings record will be more at age 70 than your survivor benefit will be at your FRA. Your goal should be to collect the highest benefit possible for the rest of your life. If you so choose, you can collect your survivor benefit first and delay your own SS benefit past your full retirement age, which would allow you to earn delayed retirement credits on your own benefit. That will increase it by 8% per year of delay, up to age 70 when your maximum Social Security retirement benefit will be reached, and at that time you would switch to the higher benefit.\n\nThis article is intended for information purposes only and does not represent legal or financial guidance.

The internet giant said Wednesday that it will expand its annual ad grants commitment to $1 billion to support nonprofits fighting things like Covid-19 and racial injustice in their outreach efforts. The firm typically provides $800 million in ad grants for nonprofits every year. It's also adding new features to its platforms, such as a tool that lets users search and book local services on Google through its Local Services Ads offering. The feature is currently only available in the U.S. and Canada, but Google plans on expanding it internationally. The move is part of a series of announcements Google is making in place of its Google Marketing Live conference, which has been made impossible due to Covid-19. The firm will organize subsequent announcements and roundtables for marketers in the coming weeks.\n\n\"It's especially important now because of Covid-19 that we're in this intense listening mode where we're trying to get feedback from the market,\" Jerry Dischler, vice president of ads at Google, told CNBC in an interview. \"We're trying to launch products as quickly as possible to address market needs.\"\n\n'War rooms'\n\nThe $200 million donation from Google follows a $800 million package it announced back in March to ease the financial pressures facing small and medium-sized firms, governments and health workers. Dischler said the company held a \"series of war rooms\" in response to the pandemic to figure out how different advertisers were being impacted as well as the response from consumers. One of the big sectors affected, he said, was the travel industry, so Google introduced a new \"pay per stay\" pricing model where it wouldn't charge travel firms for ads if a customer canceled their booking.\n\nGoogle has faced calls from some travel firms to help with the challenges of coronavirus, which has shut down economies and dried up revenues. Several travel start-ups in Germany for instance had urged the tech giant to pause ad payments for companies receiving taxpayer-funded assistance. Google says the expansion of its new ad pricing model for hotel groups should ease the burden these groups face.

It's the perfect mix of holiday flavor without going overboard in any one direction...just a nice, sweet cookie mixed into your ice cream.

In large trials illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nIt said it was trying to expedite the review to \"minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline.\"\n\n\"We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials,\" the company said.\n\nAn individual familiar with the development said researchers were told the hold was placed on the trial out of \"an abundance of caution\" after a suspected serious adverse reaction in a participant in the United Kingdom, according to STAT News.\n\nIt's unclear how long the hold on the trial will last. AstraZeneca began its trial late last month and is one of three companies currently in late-stage testing for a potential vaccine. The other two are Pfizer and Moderna, which both began their trials in late July.\n\nThe U.S. government announced May 21 that it would pay AstraZeneca up to $1.2 billion for its experimental vaccine developed alongside researchers at the University of Oxford. The U.S. will receive at least 300 million doses of the vaccine as part of its investment.\n\nAstraZeneca's vaccine, called AZD1222, uses genetic material from the coronavirus with a modified adenovirus. It uses technologies used to make an experimental Ebola vaccine, which was provided to people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2019.\n\nIn July, the company published data that showed its vaccine produced a promising immune response in an early-stage trial.\n\nThe vaccine was found to be well-tolerated and there were no serious adverse events, according to the researchers at the time. Fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported, they said. Other common side effects included pain at the injection site, muscle ache, chills and a fever.\n\nThe development comes as polls suggest Americans are already concerned about the safety of potential coronavirus vaccines.\n\nAccording to a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk Poll, two-thirds of voters say they won't get the coronavirus vaccine as soon as it becomes available.\n\n\u2013CNBC's Meg Tirrell contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/jill-biden-doctor-wall-street-journal-editor-liberal-backlash", "authors": ["Brian Flood", "Brian Flood Covers The Media For Fox News.

Kelly\u2019s Girlfriend Joycelyn Savage Speaks Out Against Him for the First Time", "text": "A Patreon account purporting to belong to Joycelyn Savage, a longtime girlfriend of R. Kelly, has detailed how her relationship with the singer evolved into one of manipulation, surveillance, and threats. It appears to mark the first time Savage has publicly accused Kelly of wrongdoing. She has previously defended him, most prominently in a joint interview with Azriel Clary\u2014another of Kelly\u2019s live-in girlfriends\u2014on CBS This Morning in March.\n\nThe Patreon posts allege that Kelly led Savage to believe he would help launch her career as a model and singer, even recording songs with her. One post notes that, after several months living together, Kelly began to give her \u201ccommands,\u201d requiring she address him as \u201cMaster\u201c or \u201cDaddy.\u201d Savage eventually became suspicious of the surveillance cameras installed on Kelly\u2019s properties, according to the post. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any type of privacy at all now that I think about it. If I showered one of his assistants would have to be by the door while I shower.\u201d The text also alludes to her limited relationship with her family. \u201cI couldn\u2018t talk to my parents in private sometimes,\u201d the post reads. \u201cI was told what to say on the phone to them.\u201d\n\nAnother post claims that Kelly twice made Savage pregnant, and that each time she had an abortion. \u201cIt\u2019s scary having your first child and aborting them because of some monster that kept me as a prisoner,\u201d the post states.\n\nR. Kelly\u2019s attorney Steve Greenberg gave a statement to Variety in response to the posts: \u201cIt is unfortunate that Jocelyn now seeks to make money by exploiting her long time, loving relationship with Robert. Obviously if she were to tell the truth no one would pay so she has, unfortunately, chosen to regurgitate the stories and lies told by others for her own personal profit. We know the real facts, and it was not until the money ran out that she decided anything was wrong. Hopefully people will see it for the obvious profiteering it is.\u201d\n\nGerald Griggs, an attorney for the Savage family, says in an interview with YouTube channel 11 Alive that they have reached out to the owner of the Patreon account and attempted to reach Joycelyn at her last known residence. (The New York Times also tried, without success, to reach Savage directly.) Savage\u2019s parents, who have been working with law enforcement on the case, were featured in the Lifetime docuseries Surviving R. Kelly, claiming that the singer \u201cbrainwashed\u201d their daughter.\n\nIn March, Kelly and Savage gave separate interviews to Gayle King on CBS This Morning. In her joint interview with Azriel Clary, Savage said she had \u201ca very strong relationship\u201d with Kelly, and that she \u201cabsolutely\u201d was in love with him. \u201cOur parents are basically out here just to get money,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause they didn\u2018t agree on what happened with music or whatever it could be. They\u2019re very upset.\u201d King noted that while Kelly was not in view of the women, they knew he was there, as he audibly coughed during the interview.\n\nThe story on Savage\u2019s Patreon mirrors two other women\u2019s stories accusing Kelly of abuse, including claims the singer made them call him \u201cDaddy.\u201d In a 2018 BuzzFeed News investigation by Jim DeRogatis and Marisa Carroll, R. Kelly\u2019s former girlfriend Lizzette Martinez described how Kelly dictated \u201cwhat I wore, how I spoke, who my friends were, who I could bring around.... You know, I\u2019m going to help you. I\u2019m going to do everything for you, but you have to listen to me.\u2019 It was always I wasn\u2019t listening to him.

Photo : Staff ( Getty Images )\n\nEthan\n\nI am very lazy at loading the dishwasher. When I finish, it kind of looks like a Jenga tower right before it\u2019s about to fall. Super inefficient. Lots of leftover dishes in the sink as a result. \u201cWhen the dishwasher finishes I\u2019ll just take out all the clean stuff and put them inside and run it again,\u201d I think to myself. And then I go to sleep, and eventually it\u2019s morning, and now I have to unload the dishwasher and load it up but I haven\u2019t even had my coffee yet so I don\u2019t and before I know it the kitchen\u2019s a mess and somehow we\u2019re still out of clean forks.\n\n\n\nMoral of the story is that if I can\u2019t even expend the extra brain power to figure out how to clean all my dishes at once I\u2019m not going to be figuring out the best way to Jenga the shit out of 512GB so I can actually play all the games I want to play when I want to play them. Games are huge now. They need constant updates. So many of them are live-service now too, built around appointment gaming: 30 minutes on Rocket League, an hour on Final Fantasy XIV, finish some Destiny 2 bounties, clear out an enemy camp in Ghost of Tsushima.\n\n\n\nMy PS4 is 500GB and I can barely fit eight games on it. I have no idea what next-gen will bring but somehow much smaller games with fewer updates doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s in the cards and I am not prepared to spend 15 minutes every night managing uploads and downloads and hunting for the Ethernet cord so it doesn\u2019t all take an eternity. I basically already do this on my PC, which for the last five years has lived solely off of a 256GB SSD. That shit is fast. It also barely fits Phantasy Star Online 2. I\u2019m not going to put myself through that for a whole other console gen.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoodnight, sweet prince. Screenshot : Sony / Kotaku\n\nAsh\n\nNo, it\u2019s not enough, but yes, it actually is. Hear me out. With the way new games are now 80-90 gigabytes apiece, a 512GB hard drive is simply not enough. But! With cloud storage to preserve my progress and the ability to redownload games I\u2019ve purchased whenever I please, it doesn\u2019t matter. The way I\u2014and I imagine most busy millennials\u2014play games means that even if my hard drive is at capacity (and looking at my PS4, it is) I\u2019m never simultaneously playing all four or five games that it\u2019ll take to fill that thing. So when a new game comes along I\u2019m more than happy to delete to free up space. Speaking of, I need to get rid of Kingdom Hearts III.\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t brick a phone if it already is one. [taps temple] Photo : Loic Venance / Staff ( Getty Images )\n\nAlexandra\n\n\n\nI\u2019m reminded of the early days of smartphones, when an entry-level model would come with 8 or 16GB of storage. That would prove sufficient for basic use, but after installing apps and adding some music you\u2019d find yourself wishing you could\u2019ve justified the unreasonable premium for the 32GB version. In 2020, with games routinely consuming tens of gigabytes and sometimes over a hundred, 512GB is the absolute minimum a \u201cnext-generation\u201d system could offer with a straight face. And just as with those 8 and 16GB phones, 512GB Xbox Series S owners are going to feel the space squeeze.\n\n\n\nThe question asked was \u201cis 512GB enough?\u201d It\u2019s enough to function, absolutely. But it\u2019s not enough to spare many users an ongoing struggle to manage storage over the console\u2019s expected lifespan, locking them into a continual cycle of downloading, deleting, and re-downloading games as needs and whim dictate. (Or, shell out for an upgrade.) What a hassle.\n\n\n\nWhile noticeably better, it\u2019s not like the Xbox Series X\u2019s 1TB or the PlayStation 5\u2019s 825GB are massive, either. We\u2019re in a bothersome period in which the space requirements of high-end games have outpaced the affordability of solid-state drive storage. Between these consoles and a long-overdue PC I want to build, I really hope SSD prices fall fast enough to catch up to games somewhat over the next few years.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAri: \u201cJune 9, 2014: the moment I knew I\u2019d buy a new Xbox just for a new Halo.\u201d Photo : Barone Firenze ( Shutterstock )\n\nAri\n\nLook: 512GB in 2020 is a very different proposition than 512GB in 2013. Video games, of course, have ballooned in size over the course of this last console generation. Who\u2019s to say how large they\u2019ll get over the course of the next one? Where it once could hold a robust library of games, my launch-edition Xbox One currently has room for Halo: The Master Chief Collection, Halo 5: Guardians, and a rotating handful of smaller games, depending on what Game Pass offerings are for any given month. Seven years from now, will the Xbox Series S have room for whatever version of Halo Infinite we\u2019re on, and nothing else? It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess.\n\n\n\nTruth told, as long as it has room for Master Chief and friends, that\u2019s good enough for me. I bought the first Xbox for Halo: Combat Evolved. I bought the Xbox 360 for Halo 3. I caved and picked up an Xbox One for The Master Chief Collection (even though that game didn\u2019t start working until four years later). I\u2019ll almost assuredly pick up some manner of next-gen Xbox box for playing Halo Infinite in all its glory. 512GB is, I\u2019d hope, fine enough for that.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne area Microsoft\u2019s Xbox UI might have a leg up on PlayStation 4's. Screenshot : Microsoft / Kotaku\n\nStephen\n\n512GB isn\u2019t enough. But! I weirdly enjoy managing downloads to my consoles, and I do think that maxing out space on my PS4 or Xbox One harddrive has played a role in motivating me to just finish a game already\u2014or just decide to not finish it and let it go\u2014so I can delete it. In that way, a digital storage constraint can be healthy for those of us who try to play too many games and need to be saved from having an endless backlog.\n\n\n\nSecond caveat: 512 GB may not be enough, but if the Xbox One vs. PS4 vs Switch digital storage management experience is anything to go by, an Xbox Series S may at least provide users good tools for dealing with the limited space. Downloads on PS4 are a debacle of installations, file-copying and a sluggish interface bereft of useful information. Downloads on Switch are similarly awkward to track. The Xbox One, however, prominently shows the amount of space you have on your harddrive in the same part of the dashboard that shows you which games and apps you have. (Until I checked again this morning, it tended to also show your download speeds and progress during an active download all in that same spot. I hope they didn\u2019t remove that!) Hopefully the Series S/X dashboard will be as user-friendly.\n\n\n\nHow About You?\n\nKotaku\u2019s weighed in, but what\u2019s your take? Is 512GB enough for you? Or does the rather small drive put you off a digital-only console like the Series S? Have your say. We\u2019ll be back next Monday to deliberate and debate on another nerdy issue.

It\u2019s said to be a standalone app targeting iOS 14, watchOS 7, and tvOS 14, rather than a replacement for the current Activity app. The new app reportedly lets you download fitness videos with different workouts and activities that you can perform as the Apple Watch tracks your session, potentially expanding the types of exercise that the Watch is able to be used for.\n\nHandwriting recognition set for Apple Pencil?\n\niOS 14 is also set to include a new API called PencilKit that allows the Apple Pencil to be used in more situations. It allows for handwriting recognition and conversion in regular text input fields, which isn\u2019t currently a standard feature; MacRumors says it\u2019ll let you use the pencil to enter text in apps like Messages, Mail, Calendar, and others. Third-party developers will apparently get some form of access to PencilKit, too.\n\niMessage may also get some new features in iOS 14, though none of them sound like much more than what is already standard UI in many other chat apps.

So they blew past their word count budgets,\" he said.\n\nThe design on NPC interactions and quests has had a focus on replayability, as Hines is realistic about not being able to produce content as fast as players can play through it. \"There's just no reasonable cadence that you can put out large volumes of quest content, that will keep up with the extent to which players burn through it, because it's gonna take you six months, nine months, a year to make content that they're gonna burn through in two weeks,\" Hines said.\n\nHe also discussed the similarities in the Fallout 76 reworks to the post-release updates Bethesda had to make to Elder Scrolls Online.

If Republicans maintain control of the chamber, that could curtail many of Biden's plans.\n\nStill, the transition will be a sharp turn from the Trump White House, under which union membership has dropped, pay inequity has widened and enforcement has dwindled. Some of the Democrats' highest priorities will be counteracting action taken \u2014 or in some cases, not taken \u2014 by the current administration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a litany of things the Trump administration has done that we have to undo,\u201d said Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), who serves on the House Education and Labor Committee.\n\nHere are some things lawmakers and experts say workers and employers can expect from a Biden White House:\n\n1. Heightened worker safety enforcement\n\nOne of the first things a Biden administration will likely move to do is instruct the Labor Department\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration to step up worker safety enforcement, including by enacting an Emergency Temporary Standard, or a set of guidelines governing how employers must protect their employees from Covid-19, and ramping up penalties on violators.\n\nWith an estimated 72,015 workers having tested positive for coronavirus and 315 fatalities in the food system alone, Democrats and labor advocates have become increasingly vocal in criticizing the Labor Department for what they say is leniency. Despite having received more than 10,000 complaints since the pandemic started, the agency hasn't proposed a penalty greater than $30,000 for coronavirus-related risks, even in cases where workers died. And Republicans have shot down an emergency standard, insisting that employers need extra flexibility during the recession.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign advocated to \u201cimmediately release and enforce an [ETS] to give employers and frontline employees specific, enforceable guidance on what to do to reduce the spread of COVID\u201d and \u201cdouble the number of OSHA investigators to enforce the law and existing standards and guidelines.\u201d\n\n2. Pursuit of progressive labor policy\n\nBiden campaigned on enacting much of the Democratic labor legislation passed out of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s House in 2020 and 2019. He said in July that he would push to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and eliminate the so-called tipped wage, which allows employers to count tips toward servers\u2019 mandated wages \u2014 both provisions included in the House-passed Raise the Wage Act. The federal minimum wage hasn\u2019t gone up since 2009, when it was hiked to $7.25.\n\nBiden also pledged he would sign the House-passed Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, which would strengthen workers' ability to unionize, including by allowing them to form unions via card-check elections, where employees sign forms authorizing the union to represent them.\n\n\u201cThe PRO Act would be the most important labor law reform since the Wagner Act itself in 1935 or the National Labor Relations Act,\u201d Levin said.\n\nPassing these bills will be highly unlikely if Republicans control the Senate. And even if some of the measures made it through, signing them would be an uphill battle for Biden, who will have to balance unions\u2019 demands with competing business interests and some of the more moderate voices that helped win him the office.\n\n\u201cThe business community is going to place a lot of demands on Biden and the Biden administration,\u201d Reich said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to like his tax increases on the wealthy and on big corporations; it\u2019s not going to like his environmental regulations and laws he has promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s only a limited amount of political capital that a new president has.\u201d\n\n3. A boost to manufacturing via trade\n\nBiden has been outspoken against Trump\u2019s trade war with China, labeling some of the White House\u2019s tariffs \"damaging\" and \"disastrous.\u201d Were he to lift some of the Trump administration\u2019s trade restrictions, it could provide an immediate boost to the manufacturing workforce. Despite gaining 66,000 jobs in September, factory employment is still down 647,000 jobs from February because of the pandemic, according to Labor Departments statistics.\n\nIn his manufacturing plan, Biden advocates for \u201ca Pro-American worker tax and trade strategy to fix the harmful policies of the Trump Administration and give our manufacturers and workers the fair shot they need,\u201d along with a series of tax credits and executive actions. Although Biden could in theory lift any tariff as soon as he took office, he must also answer to business and other interests that might want the restrictions to stay in place for months as he forms a plan. A top trade adviser said his administration wouldn't rule out imposing new tariffs on imports.\n\nUnions including the United Steelworkers, which represents over a million workers and retirees across several manufacturing industries, say they have confidence in Biden's plan whatever it may entail.\n\n\u201cThe USW looks forward to working with Joe Biden in implementing his plans to get our country back on track,\u201d the United Steelworkers said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019ll attend to our domestic supply chains, strengthening U.S. manufacturing and making us all safer.\u201d\n\n4. A more labor-friendly NLRB\n\nThe former vice president is widely expected to eventually take back control of the National Labor Relations Board, the agency responsible for enforcing the National Labor Relations Act and settling disputes between unions and employers.\n\nUnder Trump, the makeup of the NLRB has shifted to include three Republicans, all of whom are Trump appointees, and one Democrat, a holdover whose renomination the Senate approved July 24. The second Democratic seat remains empty. With the 3-1 majority, GOP members have pushed through a series of corporate-friendly decisions, including the pivotal call last May that Uber drivers be classified as independent contractors rather than employees.\n\nWithin his first term, Biden would be able to re-establish a Democratic majority on the board, realigning its decision-making with that seen under the Obama administration.\n\n5. A note of caution\n\nDespite the lofty promises made along the campaign trail, former Democratic presidents like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama offer proof that labor reform is never a sure thing. Both men pledged to push through a wide range of policy, only to have their plans overtaken by other agenda items like health care. Obama pledged to enact the Employee Free Choice Act \u2014 some provisions of which were later folded into the PRO Act \u2014 only to eventually focus his legislative efforts elsewhere, leaving the package to die despite a Democratic majority in both chambers.\n\n\u201cLabor\u2019s been in this place before where the political stars have aligned,\u201d Bob Bruno, director of the labor studies program at the University of Illinois, said. \u201cAnd they haven\u2019t been a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took a backseat to health care, it took a backseat to a bailout for the auto industry, it took a backseat to a stimulus bill. So it never happened.\"\n\nAdds Reich: \u201cNone of this is a slam dunk.\u201d\n\nRebecca Rainey contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://nypost.com/2020/06/09/sam-darnold-organizing-florida-workouts-for-jets-offense/", "authors": ["June"], "title": "Sam Darnold organizing Florida workouts for Jets offense", "text": "Jets quarterback Sam Darnold and his skill players are getting a jump on training camp.\n\nDarnold will fly to Florida later this week and conduct workouts this weekend with most of the Jets receivers, fellow quarterbacks, running backs and tight ends, according to a source.\n\nThe Jets, like all NFL teams, have not been able to practice together this spring because of COVID-19 restrictions.

Giants like Hikvision, China Telecom and China Mobile were added earlier this year.\n\nThis month, the White House published an executive order, first reported by Reuters, that sought to give teeth to the list by prohibiting U.S. investors from buying securities of the blacklisted companies from November 2021.\n\nThe directive is unlikely to deal the firms a serious blow, experts said, due to its limited scope, uncertainty about the stance of the Biden administration and already-scant holdings by U.S. funds.\n\nStill, combined with other measures, it deepens a rift between Washington and Beijing, already at loggerheads over the coronavirus and China\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong.\n\nCongress and the administration have sought increasingly to curb the U.S. market access of Chinese companies that do not comply with rules faced by American rivals, even if that means antagonizing Wall Street.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/469791-paul-dismisses-bevin-loss-touts-red-wave-in-other-kentucky-races", "authors": [], "title": "Paul dismisses Bevin loss, touts 'red wave' in other Kentucky races", "text": "Sen.

Veteran right-hander Anibal Sanchez has kept the Cardinals hitless and scoreless through the first six innings, only giving up a walk and later hitting a batter.\n\nThe Nationals struck first in the second inning thanks to the bottom of their order. Howie Kendrick, the Game 5 hero, led off with a double. He later scored on a Yan Gomes double, giving Washington an early lead. (Gomes is in the lineup due to Kurt Suzuki taking a Walker Buehler fastball off the wrist and face in Game 5.) The Nationals later plated a second run thanks to Kendrick singling in Adam Eaton following a tripe in the seventh.\n\nThe game can be streamed on fuboTV (Try for free). Below, you can follow along with our live blog.\n\nLive updates\n\nWe'll be with you the whole game, providing analysis and reaction to the game's best moments. If you're having trouble viewing the live blog, please click here.\n\nThough the Nationals had a better regular-season record (93-69) than the Cardinals (91-71), by virtue of winning their division (as opposed to being a wild card) the Cardinals will possess home-field advantage in this series as a product of baseball's playoff seeding rules.\n\nGiven the Nationals have topped the odds to get here -- staging a late, furious comeback against one of the best relievers in baseball in the Wild Card Game, then knocking off the top seed in the Dodgers during the NLDS -- having to play on the road one additional time seems unlikely to bother them. If there is a drawback for the Nationals, it's that they'll open the series with Anibal Sanchez as opposed to one of their three aces.\n\nSanchez pitched well in his NLDS start, and is coming off a better regular season than most realize. He pitches with a broad arsenal, beginning with a 90 mph fastball and including a swing-and-miss splitter that coerced whiffs on nearly a third of swings, per Statcast data.\n\nOpposing Sanchez is Miles Mikolas. Mikolas throws a bit harder, with his heater checking in at 93 mph, and does almost all of his bidding with one of his fastballs or one of his two breaking balls -- an upper-80s slider or a curve that's about 10 ticks slower.\n\nGame 2 is Saturday afternoon in St. Louis before the series shifts to Washington D.C. for Monday's Game 3.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.packers.com/news/inbox-it-s-an-overall-culture", "authors": ["Mike Spofford"], "title": "Inbox: It\u2019s an overall culture", "text": "Dan from Madison, AL\n\nIs anyone tracking the next major milestone for the Packers, in that with six more Aaron Rodgers TD passes, Green Bay will be the only team in NFL history to have three QBs combine for 1,000 TD passes for a single franchise? (Starr 152, Favre 442, Rodgers 400 and counting). Put in perspective, the Bears would have to combine their top 17 passers in history to equal 1,000 TDs thrown. Is Packer Nation blessed or what?\n\nThat's pretty cool. A family friend shared with me an editorial last week from the Chicago media that said the Bears' top three QBs in their history haven't combined for 50,000 passing yards, while Rodgers has 50,000-plus and Favre had 60,000-plus in Green Bay. On top of that, the Bears don't have a single receiver with 500 receptions, and \ufeffDavante Adams\ufeff became the Packers' fifth to hit the number. It's an astonishing perspective. What it means to get the QB position right should never be undersold.\n\nRobert from Verona, WI\n\nI know \ufeffAaron Jones\ufeff has missed some time this year and shares some of his workload with \ufeffJamaal Williams\ufeff, but I noticed he has 145 carries on the year compared to Derrick Henry who has 271 carries. Henry seems to be built to take punishment, but he led the league in carries last year with 303 and is on pace to eclipse that number this year. Do you think his workload will catch up to him, or do you think his size/frame is enough to offset the heavy usage?\n\nThere's no way to know for sure. Some workhorses turn out like Emmitt Smith and Adrian Peterson, some end up more like Larry Johnson and Michael Turner, and there are a whole bunch who fall in between. My gut says Henry will be in between, leaning more toward the front of the group.\n\nHoward from Appleton, WI\n\nI watched the Bills-49ers Monday night, and I was amazed by the play of Josh Allen \u2013 not so much his throwing (though he does well getting the ball to his receivers) but the way he sees the field, carries himself, and leads his team. What especially made it amazing is my memory of the only other full game I had seen him play, against Green Bay in 2018, he was flat-out horrible in every respect. What are some other noteworthy instances of dramatic improvement you have witnessed?\n\nAt quarterback, it's a long list, starting with Hall of Famers like Brett Favre and Peyton Manning. His rookie year in Indy, Manning threw 28 picks and had a 71.2 passer rating. More recently involving current players, this week's opponent, Matthew Stafford, comes to mind. As a rookie in '09, he completed barely 50% of his passes, threw 20 picks and had a 61.0 rating. Another upcoming opponent, Ryan Tannehill, fits the bill, too.\n\nRandy from Fort Myers, FL\n\nAfter watching all the extra points missed in the last weeks both with the Packers and Vikings, I looked it up and 2020 represents the worst year in extra points in league history. Apparently fans are good for extra points.\n\nAll righty then.\n\nDale from Prescott, WI\n\nLast Sunday, Jim Nantz stated AR seems really relaxed and enjoying himself during the production meeting. Who attends those meetings and what is discussed/covered? Thanks!\n\nI'm not certain on all the specifics, but the broadcast crew (booth announcers, sideline reporters, a top producer or two) will hold meetings with the head coach, QB, and perhaps another top player. They get background information about the game plan and preparation, with the promise that it's confidential and only to be used during the broadcast. They'll also try to get a behind-the-scenes anecdote or two from the season they can share on the air. Often the broadcasters attend the last practice of the week for the host team and meet with them after. They conduct the meetings with the visiting team upon arrival at the hotel.\n\nNeil from Sun Prairie, WI\n\nGood morning Mike and Wes, just a reminder that out of an abundance of caution the NFL has banned all teams from participating in slobberknockers for this season, including playoffs. Hopefully they will return next season. Thanks for your support.\n\nThat's funny, but I feel like I shouldn't be laughing.\n\nTerry from Sun Prairie, WI\n\nWhat player in Packers history had the most yards per rush in one game?\n\nIn a game with at least 10 rushing attempts, that honor belongs to Billy Grimes, who had 167 yards on 10 carries (16.7 avg.) vs. the New York Yanks on Oct. 8, 1950.\n\nDaniel from Allen, TX\n\nMike: I'm sorry, but Weston was wrong.

The dead included five children as young as a year old, their pregnant mother and a 17-year-old female neighbor.\n\nJose Gonzalez, left, follows his 5-year-old daughter, carried by a police officer, as they leave a hospital in Santiago, Panama, January 16, 2020. Gonzalez's wife and five of their children are among seven people killed in a religious ritual in the Ngabe Bugle indigenous community. Arnulfo Franco/AP\n\n\"They searched this family out to hold a ritual and they massacred them, mistreated them, killed practically the whole family,\" Baloyes said, adding that one of the suspects in the killing is the grandfather of the children who were slain.\n\nAll the victims, and apparently all the suspects, were members of the same indigenous community.\n\nRicardo Miranda, leader of the Ngab\u00e9 Bugl\u00e9 semi-autonomous zone known as a Comarca, called the sect \"satanic\" and said it went against the region's Christian beliefs.\n\n\"We demand the immediate eradication of this Satanic sect, which violates all the practices of spirituality and co-existence in the Holy Scriptures,\" Miranda said.\n\nApparently, the sect is relatively new to the area, and had been operating locally only for about three months.\n\nThings reportedly came to a head Saturday, when one of the church members had a vision.\n\n\"One of them said God had given them a message,\" Baloyes said. That message apparently boiled down to making everyone repent or die.\n\nThe Ngab\u00e9 Bugl\u00e9 are Panama's largest indigenous group and suffer from high rates of poverty and illiteracy.\n\nIt was not clear what belief or affiliations \"The New Light of God\" church has. A well-established evangelical church known as Luz del Mundo (Light of the World) said in a press statement that it had no ties to the case.\n\nThe area is so remote that helicopters had to be used to ferry the injured out to hospitals for treatment. They included at least two pregnant women and some children.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://gizmodo.com/heres-why-netflix-is-leaving-some-roku-and-samsung-devi-1839782970", "authors": [], "title": "Here's Why Netflix Is Leaving Some Roku and Samsung Devices", "text": "Netflix recently broke for a number of users, and the error message the company provided wasn\u2019t entirely clear about why. Gizmodo spoke with the company about the incident, and Netflix offered more details about why this is happening.\n\nLast week, multiple outlets reported that select Roku devices, as well as older Samsung or Vizio TVs, would soon lose support for Netflix beginning in December. In a note on its support page, Netflix said that affected users would begin seeing error messages about the changes. That same note\u2014one that seems rather vague considering a total disappearance of its service from user devices\u2014blamed unspecified \u201ctechnical limitations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve notified all impacted members with more information about alternative devices we support so they can keep enjoying Netflix uninterrupted,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson told Gizmodo by email. The spokesperson added the change would affect a \u201csmall number\u201d of older devices. But that doesn\u2019t really scratch the surface of why this is happening, so what gives?\n\nThe Netflix spokesperson told Gizmodo the company is constantly improving upon its product, but with respect to Roku devices in particular, the issue boils down to older devices running Windows Media DRM. Since 2010, Netflix has been using Microsoft PlayReady. The spokesperson said that, starting December 2, older devices that aren\u2019t able to upgrade to PlayReady won\u2019t be able to use the service.\n\nA Roku spokesperson told Gizmodo that many of the affected devices are eight- to ten-years-old and noted that old hardware can\u2019t keep up with new software forever. According to the company, Roku devices that will no longer support Netflix include: Roku SD (N1050), Roku HD-XR (N1101), Roku HD (N1100, 2000C), and Roku XD (2050X, 2050N, 2100X, 2100N). The spokesperson said the company has been communicating with its customers directly both by email as well as on-device about the change.\n\nWhen reached for comment by email, Samsung also cited \u201ctechnical limitations.\u201d It said that the lack of Netflix support \u201cwill impact select 2010 and 2011 Samsung Smart TV models that were sold in the U.S. and Canada.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVizio, meanwhile, said that its impacted devices were sold around 2012 to 2014 and include some of its Smart TVs with VIZIO Internet Apps (V.I.A.). The company added that Netflix \u201ccontinues to work smoothly on other VIZIO Smart TVs with VIZIO Internet Apps Plus (V.I.A. Plus) and SmartCast TVs/Displays. There are still over 70 apps available to consumers with V.I.A. devices.\u201d\n\nWatching your loved-to-death gadgets eventually go the way Dodo is rough.

A day before Halloween, an earlier shooting of a child resurfaced in the news when a jury acquitted a man who was charged with first-degree murder in the 2014 death of an 11-year-old girl who was shot while inside a house at a slumber party.\n\nInvestigators think the 7-year-old girl was shot in a gang-related attack. The man believed to be the target was a 30-year-old shot in the hand, police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.\n\nThe 15-year-old was charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of battery through discharge of a firearm, police said in a news release Friday night. He was taken into custody and interviewed earlier Friday.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported police believe the gunman is a member of the Gangster Two-Six gang and was targeting a member of the Latin Kings.\n\nThe girl was trick-or-treating as a group of males chased a man down the street in the Little Village neighborhood. Someone in the group opened fire, police said.\n\n\"This is unacceptable,\" Sgt. Rocco Alioto said. \"A 7-year-old girl that was trick-or-treating with her family had to get shot because a group of guys want to shoot at another male.\"\n\nThe shooter had on a mask like the one the character Jason wears in the \"Friday the 13th\" movies, Guglielmi said, adding that investigators had found a gun that might be the weapon used in the shooting.\n\nThe girl was shot in the lower neck and rushed to a hospital in critical condition, according to Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford. She was in critical but stable condition Friday, Guglielmi said.\n\nThe wounded man, who was shot in his left hand, was taken to a hospital in good condition.\n\nThe shooting came on a night where children typically crowd the streets. But in Chicago, because of snowy weather, the number of children trick-or-treating was smaller than normal.\n\nThe girl was one of several people shot in U.S. cities during Halloween night activities. In the San Francisco Bay area community of Orinda, California, police said four people were killed in a shooting at a party. And in the eastern Utah community of Roosevelt, one man was fatally shot and a second man was stabbed to death at a party.\n\nInvestigators in the Chicago shooting received several tips from the public in the hours after the gunfire, and police recovered surveillance video that detectives believe shows people involved in the shooting or people who know those who were involved.\n\nMore from :\n\nTeen pleads guilty to murdering girlfriend pregnant with their baby: 'I took her life'\n\nTrick-or-treater, 7, critically injured in Chicago shooting\n\nConvicted rapist mistakenly released from Georgia prison recaptured hundreds of miles away in Kentucky", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/confederate-bases-military-petraeus.html", "authors": ["Fred Kaplan"], "title": "Trump\u2019s Support for Confederate Base Names Has Nothing to Do With Respecting the Military", "text": "President Donald Trump just dug himself in more deeply on the wrong side of history in the fast-changing consensus on the role and shame of racism in America. In a tweet Wednesday afternoon, Trump strongly opposed renaming the 10 U.S. Army bases that are named after Confederate officers. As he put it:\n\nThese Monumental and very Powerful Bases have become part of a Great American Heritage, and a history of Winning, Victory, and Freedom. The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations. Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!\n\nTrump displayed no understanding of just who the namesakes of these bases were\u2014nor that these bases were given their names after World War I and, in some cases, after World War II.\n\nHe tweeted his objection in the wake of news that his acting secretary of the army, Ryan McCarthy, expressed a willingness to have a \u201cbipartisan conversation\u201d about renaming the bases. McCarthy\u2019s statement came after retired Gen. David Petraeus, former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote an article for the Atlantic late last week, headlined, \u201cTake the Confederate Names Off Our Army Bases.\u201d\n\nSince then, three retired Army colonels, who had notable careers in their time on active duty, Mike Jason, John Nagl, and Paul Yingling, made a similar argument in DefenseOne.\n\nIn short, 155 years after the end of the Civil War, the U.S. Army seems on the verge of accepting the full terms of the Union victory.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is, as usual, clueless about the history of the country he supposedly leads. And rather than take the lead on a movement to redress the symbolism of white supremacy, a step that shouldn\u2019t be so difficult, he once again prefers to bask in what he sees as the buzzwords of his base\u2014STRENGTH! HEROES! MILITARY!\u2014even as decorated veterans, who embody those values more authentically than he ever will, are coming to terms with the sinful roots of certain aspects of their tradition.\n\nAll 10 of the Army bases are in former Confederate states in the South. Fort Benning, Georgia, home of several armored and infantry brigades, is named after Gen. Henry Benning, whose support for slavery was so avid that he proposed seceding from the Union and forming a Southern slavocracy more than a decade before the Civil War began. Fort Bragg, North Carolina, home of the 82nd Airborne Division, is named after Gen. Braxton Bragg, who wasn\u2019t even a good officer; he got into so many quarrels with superiors and subordinates that he once missed an opportunity to exploit a weakness in Union Gen. Ulysses Grant\u2019s formation. Fort Gordon, Georgia, home of the Army Cyber Corps, is named after Gen. John Brown Gordon, a slave owner who rose quickly through the Confederate ranks and, after the war, joined the Ku Klux Klan. The list goes on.\n\nIn his Atlantic article, Petraeus wrote that, in his many years as an active-duty officer, often stationed at these bases,\n\nI never thought much about these men\u2014about the nature of their service during the Civil War \u2026 the reasons they were honored, or the timing of the various forts\u2019 dedications. Nor did I think about the message those names sent to the many African Americans serving on these installations\u2014messages that should have been noted by all of us.\n\nNor, when he was a cadet at West Point, did he question the veneration shown toward Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, who was a great commander but also\u2014like all the other Confederate officers\u2014guilty of treason. \u201cWe were not encouraged to think deeply about the cause for which\u201d Lee had fought, Petraeus writes, \u201cat least not in our military history classes.\u201d\n\nPetraeus told me, in an email on Wednesday, that it was only after he retired from the Army, in 2011, that he \u201cstarted thinking about how strange it was that the leaders of the fight against the Union were more widely honored\u2014with their names on federal forts, roads, barracks, gates, housing areas, etc.\u2014than were those who fought for the country. And, of course, those fighting to secede were doing so to preserve the rights of their states to enslave others, with those \u2018others\u2019 now roughly 20 percent of the soldiers serving on those bases.\u201d\n\nThese thoughts deepened as he read several biographies of Gen. Ulysses Grant, the Union Army commander and later two-term president, who was honored hardly at all either at West Point or Army bases. Petraeus says he has \u201cbeen mulling for some time\u201d that the Army should publicly address this dishonor. \u201cThe events of recent weeks,\u201d he said, \u201cwere the catalyst to write the essay.\u201d\n\nJohn Nagl graduated from West Point in 1988\u201414 years after Petraeus\u2014but the treatment of Confederate heroes remained the same. He didn\u2019t see the light until 2017, when protests began over Confederate monuments in several Southern cities. Also in that year, Rep. Yvette Clarke introduced a bill in Congress to strip Army bases of Confederate names\u2014to the firm opposition of the Army and with little support from her colleagues in the House.\n\nThe controversy spurred Nagl, who is now the head of a boys\u2019 school in Pennsylvania, to read up on the history of the monuments. \u201cIt was then,\u201d he wrote me in an email on Wednesday, \u201cthat I learned that they had been erected long after the Civil War, as part of Jim Crow racial terror reinforcement, and learned as well that the Army had named posts and forts after Confederate generals in the same era. It\u2019s been simmering inside me since, and the current moment seemed like an opportunity to help the service I love so well right a longstanding wrong.\u201d\n\nMike Jason graduated from West Point later still, in 1995, as a military history major, and by then the academy was changing. The history department \u201cwas already using words for treason when it came to Confederate graduates,\u201d he wrote me in an email. \u201cThe reverence was definitely in severe decline.\u201d His lightning-bolt moment\u2014when the names of the bases became more than merely \u201cuncomfortable or silly\u201d\u2014came when Jason was an Army captain, moving back from a tour in Europe to D.C. \u201cI just imagined being in the shoes of one of my black NCOs [noncommissioned officers], driving by a confederate monument on Jefferson Davis Highway to a Ft. Lee or Ft. Pickett\u2014it stopped me dead in my tracks.\u201d\n\nJason, who is now a defense consultant, \u201cgot hot on the issue\u201d just this past February, soon after retiring from the Army, when he posted a tweet recalling the time, back in 2008, when his brigade commander ordered the removal of all Confederate regalia. The Army Times called him for an interview; he went on the record to discuss the issue and afterward started \u201csounding the bell on social media\u201d constantly. \u201cMany officers have reached out to me for mentorship and to talk it over.\u201d Other officers, NCOs, and enlisted men and women have kept up the discussion.\n\nIn short, the issue has been festering quietly, behind the scenes, for some time. And now, with the vast protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, the suddenly swift passage of new laws and regulations on police behavior, and the realization by even the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that the Republicans have to do something about the scourge of racism and the brutality of many police departments\u2014it\u2019s no surprise that the discussion of the 10 Confederate-named bases has risen to the fore as well, even if their president has his head in the sand.\n\nOpinion on this, as on the many other issues raised by the Floyd killing, is shifting quickly. As recently as February, soon after the Marine Corps announced it was banning the display of Confederate flags, an Army spokesman said his service had no plans to rename military bases. \u201cThe Army has a tradition of naming installations and streets after historical figures of military significance, including Union and Confederate general officers,\u201d he told Task & Purpose magazine.\n\nThis answer would now be unacceptable to anyone besides Trump. The valor of an officer can no longer be separated from the criminal depravity of his cause, and many of the still-honored Confederate officers lacked so much as valor. Nor, more broadly, can history be minimized as the inanimate stuff of street signs, statues, or military bases. History is a living thing.

But there was no deal quite yet.The long-delayed measure was coming together as Capitol Hill combatants finally fashioned difficult compromises, often at the expense of more ambitious Democratic wishes for the legislation, to complete the second major relief package of the pandemic.A hoped-for announcement Wednesday failed to materialize as lawmakers across the spectrum hammered out details of the sprawling legislation and top negotiators continued to trade offers. But lawmakers briefed on the outlines of the aid bill freely shared them.It's the first significant legislative response to the pandemic since the landmark CARES Act in March, which delivered $1.8 trillion in aid and more generous jobless benefits and direct payments to individuals. Since then, Democrats have repeatedly called for ambitious further federal steps to provide relief and battle the pandemic, while Republicans have sought to more fully reopen the economy and to avoid padding the government's $27 trillion debt.President-elect Joe Biden is eager for an aid package to prop up the economy and deliver direct aid to the jobless and hungry, even though the package falls short of what Democrats want. He called the emerging version \"an important down payment\" and promised more help next year.Republicans, too, are anxious to approve some aid before going home for the year.\"We're still close and we're gonna get there,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told reporters Wednesday evening as he left the Capitol. And during a Senate GOP lunchtime call a day earlier, party leaders stressed the importance of reaching an agreement before the upcoming Georgia Senate runoff election.The details were still being worked out, but lawmakers in both parties said leaders had agreed on a top-line total of about $900 billion, with direct payments of perhaps $600 to most Americans and a $300-per-week bonus federal unemployment benefit to partially replace a $600-per-week benefit that expired this summer. It also includes the renewal of extra weeks of state unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless. More than $300 billion in subsidies for business, including a second round of \"paycheck protection\" payments to especially hard-hit businesses, are locked in, as is $25 billion to help struggling renters with their payments and provide food aid and farm subsidies, and a $10 billion bailout for the Postal Service.Democrats acknowledged that the removal of a $160 billion-or-so aid package for state and local governments whose budgets have been thrown out of balance by the pandemic was a bitter loss.\"It's heartbreaking for us,\" said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, whose state has big fiscal problems.The emerging package was serving as a magnet for adding on other items, and the two sides continued to swap offers. It was apparent that another temporary spending bill would be needed to prevent a government shutdown at midnight on Friday. That was likely to easily pass.House lawmakers returned to Washington on Wednesday in hopes of a vote soon on the broader package, which would combine the COVID-19 relief with a $1.4 trillion governmentwide funding bill and a host of other remaining congressional business, including extending expiring tax breaks and passing other unfinished legislation.Negotiations intensified on Tuesday after months of futility. Before the election, with Democrats riding high in the polls, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a hard line for more aid. Now, McConnell is playing a strong hand after a better-than-expected performance in the elections limited GOP losses in Senate races.The frightening, record surge in COVID caseloads and deaths, combined with troubling economic indicators, however, is mandating an agreement, though the emerging package contains less economic stimulus than the March aid bill.\"The case for fiscal policy right now is very, very strong,\" Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday. \"I think that is widely understood now. It's a very positive thing that we may finally be getting that.\"McConnell successfully pushed to get Democrats to drop their much-sought $160 billion state and local government aid package while giving up a key priority of his own - a liability shield for businesses and other institutions like universities fearing COVID-19 lawsuits. Democrats cited other gains for states and localities in the emerging deal such as help for transit systems, schools and vaccine distribution.The addition of the $600 direct payments came after recent endorsements from both President Donald Trump and progressives including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who remains dissatisfied about the overall package.\"Everything that is in that package is vitally needed,\" Sanders said Wednesday on MSNBC. \"The problem is that it is a much smaller package than the country needs in this moment of economic desperation.\"A poisonous dynamic has long infected the negotiations, but the mood was businesslike in two meetings in Pelosi's Capitol suite Tuesday that resulted in a burst of progress.Pressure for a deal is intense. Unemployment benefits run out Dec. 26 for more than 10 million people. Many businesses are barely hanging on after nine months of the pandemic. And money is needed to distribute new vaccines that are finally offering hope for returning the country to a semblance of normalcy.The looming agreement follows efforts by a bipartisan group of rank-and-file lawmakers to find middle ground between a $2.4 trillion House bill and a $500 billion GOP measure fashioned by McConnell.Their $908 billion proposal has served as a template for the talks, although the bipartisan group, led by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, favored aid to states and localities instead of another round of stimulus payments. The CARES Act provided for $1,200 payments per individual and $500 per child.\"I think that the work that our bipartisan group did really helped to stimulate this,\" Collins said.With Congress otherwise getting ready to close up shop, lawmakers are eager to use the relief package to carry other unfinished business.A leading candidate is a 369-page water resources bill that targets $10 billion for 46 Army Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental, and coastal protection projects. Another potential addition would extend favorable tax treatment for \"look through\" entities of offshore subsidiaries of U.S. corporations. Meanwhile, thousands of craft brewers, wineries, and distillers are facing higher taxes in April if their tax break isn't extended.The end-of-session rush also promises relief for victims of shockingly steep surprise medical bills, a phenomenon that often occurs when providers drop out of insurance company networks. That measure, combined with an assortment of other health policy provisions, generates savings for federal funding for community health centers.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://metro.co.uk/2020/10/23/dying-pensioner-84-burgled-by-couple-who-pretended-to-call-ambulance-for-help-13472718/", "authors": ["Jordan King"], "title": "Dying pensioner burgled 'by couple who pretended to call ambulance'", "text": "Lancashire Police has released CCTV footage of a man and a woman they would like to speak to in connection with the alleged incident (Picture: Lancashire Police)\n\nAn elderly woman was burgled while she was dying in her bed by two people who pretended they were calling an ambulance, according to police.\n\nRonald Crowther, 87, left his house in Brierfield, Lancashire, to search for help after his wife Dorothy, 84, suffered an aneurysm on October 16.\n\nA man and woman allegedly offered to call an ambulance and entered the house, while Ronald returned upstairs to sit with his wife.\n\nHis wife of 60 years passed away shortly after.

You\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier.\" https://t.co/3uxOAu0Ues\n\n\u201cIowa\u2019s a Democratic caucus,\u201d the former vice president responded. \u201cYou ever been to a caucus?\u201d\n\nWhen Moore said she had, he responded, \u201cNo you haven\u2019t. You\u2019re a lying dog-faced pony soldier.\u201d\n\nThe phrase immediately got attention, with many confused by Biden\u2019s choice of words. As it turns out, \u201clying dog-faced pony soldier\u201d is a phrase Biden has used before. He attributes it to John Wayne, though its actual provenance is somewhat unclear.\n\nBut for Moore, the problem wasn\u2019t so much Biden\u2019s word choice as the fact that he responded to her question by demanding whether she\u2019d ever been to a caucus.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden has been performing incredibly poorly in this race,\u201d Moore told the Washington Post. \u201cHis inability to answer a simple question from a nobody college student like me only exacerbates that reality.\u201d\n\nBiden has been criticized in the past for responding to questions \u2014 especially questions posed by women \u2014 in ways that seem condescending, as when he called moderator Lyz Lenz a \u201clovely person\u201d after her question at a September LGBTQ rights forum. And the moment in New Hampshire was another reminder that while Biden\u2019s responses may seem folksy or homespun to some, to others they\u2019re a sign that he\u2019s not always treating voters with the seriousness they deserve.\n\nBiden has used \u201clying dog-faced pony soldier\u201d before\n\nBiden explained the provenance of \u201clying dog-faced pony soldier\u201d at a North Dakota rally in 2018, saying that his brother loved to use lines from movies.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a line in a movie, a John Wayne movie, where the Indian chief turns to John Wayne and says, this is a lying dog-faced pony soldier,\u201d Biden said.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if this line actually shows up in any John Wayne movie \u2014 as Matthew Dessem points out at Slate, there are 180 to sift through. The general consensus seems to be that Biden is probably thinking of the 1952 Tyrone Power film Pony Soldier, in which a character says, \u201cThe pony soldier speaks with a tongue of the snake that rattles.\u201d\n\nWhatever the case, Biden has used the line in the past when responding to questions. At an Iowa event in December, a young voter said that President Obama promised his father that he could keep his existing health plan after the passage of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 but, in fact, his dad wasn\u2019t able to do so.\n\n\u201cWere you lying to my dad?\u201d the voter asked.\n\n\u201cA lying dog-faced pony soldier. No,\u201d Biden said, before acknowledging that some people were forced to change plans under the ACA.\n\nWhen he used the phrase on Sunday, it felt like a bit of a left turn from Moore\u2019s question. She had asked why voters should believe he could win, following his fourth-place finish in Iowa. His response was, apparently, to start explaining caucuses to her, assuming she\u2019d never been to one.\n\nAs it happens, he was right \u2014 Moore later said in a statement to the Washington Post that she had never been to a caucus.\n\n\u201cI asked Joe Biden a fair question,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHis immediate response was to question whether I had ever attended a caucus. In my nervousness in the presence of the former Vice President, I nodded yes.\u201d\n\nWhether she\u2019d personally been to a caucus or not, she told the Post, was irrelevant to her question.\n\nIt\u2019s part of a pattern in his interactions with voters\n\nThe \u201clying dog-faced pony soldier\u201d phrase itself was a joke, according to Biden campaign traveling national press secretary Remi Yamamoto.\n\nLike Olivia notes, it's a joke that was met with.... drumroll... laughter in the room and from the questioner. It's from a John Wayne movie and he's made it plenty of times before. Sorry to ruin the fun twitter!  https://t.co/XIbn8wF53W https://t.co/5D0Kk06RGK\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t the first time Biden has faced scrutiny for his responses to questions.\n\nIn June, activist K.C. Cayo asked Biden about his stance on the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions (though he supported Hyde in the past, Biden now says he backs repeal of the amendment). Cayo, who uses they/them pronouns, and the two women activists with them, also asked Biden to protect sexual assault survivors.\n\nIn response, Cayo wrote at Vice, Biden \u201cleaned in very close to my face, and started wagging his finger at me,\u201d saying, \u201cNobody has spoken about it, done more, or changed more than I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to even finish my 30-second elevator pitch \u2014 I never got past the first sentence,\u201d Cayo told Vice. \u201cJust the fact that he wagged his finger at me in such a condescending manner is very telling.\u201d\n\nThen, at a forum on LGBTQ issues in September, moderator Lyz Lenz brought up Biden\u2019s votes in favor of \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and the Defense of Marriage Act. \u201cYou did vote to repeal both of those, but you have also praised Vice President Mike Pence as a \u2018decent guy,\u2019\u201d Lenz noted.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a lovely person,\u201d the former vice president responded.\n\nAn attention grabbing moment from Biden\u2019s time on stage when moderator \u2066@lyzl\u2069 pushed Biden on past votes and calling \u2066@VP\u2069 a \u201cdecent guy.\u201d  \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely person,\u201d Biden tells the moderator to laugher.  \u201cJust asking the questions people want to know,\u201d she replied https://t.co/DB10NGuBCP\n\nLenz later said that Biden had called her \u201ca real sweetheart\u201d backstage at the event, and that she saw both comments as \u201ca little condescending.\u201d\n\nBiden has also faced questions about his behavior with women in the past, with several saying he kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable. The former VP has said he will change to match evolving \u201csocial norms,\u201d but to some, the way he has spoken to women on the campaign trail is evidence he\u2019s not changing enough.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that \u201clying dog-faced pony soldier\u201d itself was meant as a joke, and that lines like this are part of Biden\u2019s style. Film writer Farran Nehme describes the phrase as \u201cuniquely Uncle Joe.\u201d\n\nAFAIK, \"dog face\" = infantry soldier, \"pony soldier\" = an indifferently shot 1952 movie about the Canadian Mounties that starred Tyrone Power. Combining the two, I suspect, is uniquely Uncle Joe. https://t.co/sG807apdko\n\nBiden\u2019s \u201cUncle Joe\u201d persona (sometimes, less flatteringly, \u201cCreepy Uncle Joe\u201d) was the subject of jokes during the Obama years. But he\u2019s not the vice president anymore, the older foil to a young commander in chief. Now, Biden is running to be the leader of the country, and young voters are less likely to brush it off when he answers their questions with strange movie references \u2014 at 77, he has to prove that he actually understands them and their concerns.\n\nHe also has to prove he takes them seriously. The biggest issue with the \u201cpony soldier\u201d comment, for Moore, seems to be the sentiment behind it \u2014 that she, a young female voter with a serious question to ask, needed a fairly basic part of the American democratic process explained to her. Whether or not that was Biden\u2019s intent, it was part of a pattern this election cycle, in which some voters \u2014 many of them women \u2014 have left interactions with him feeling belittled or disrespected.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Sun Feb 09 18:43:26 +0000 2020", "id": 1226577362562752513, "id_str": "1226577362562752513", "full_text": "After a New Hampshire voter asks @JoeBiden why they should trust he can turn his campaign around, he asks if she\u2019s ever been to a caucus before; when she says yes, Biden snaps: \"No you haven\u2019t.

REUTERS/Aly Song\n\nWith no end in sight for the outbreak, the economic repercussions from the shutdown of chunks of Chinese industry could trigger recessions in Japan in Singapore, where data on Monday pointed to possible contractions in the current quarter.\n\nIn Hubei, the epicenter of the outbreak, health officials reported 1,933 new cases and 100 new deaths on Feb. 16, the lowest daily death count since Feb. 11. The number of new cases rose nearly 5% from the previous day, but the number of deaths fell from 139.\n\nNearly 90% of the new cases were in the provincial capital of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have originated at a market illegally trading wildlife.\n\nAcross mainland China, officials said the total number of cases rose by 2,048 to 70,548, with 1,770 deaths.\n\nChinese health officials on Sunday said two days of falls in the number of new confirmed cases showed their efforts to halt the spread of the virus were bearing fruit, although international experts say it is too early to say the epidemic has peaked. Of the 70,000-plus cases in mainland China, 10,844 people have been treated and released from hospital.\n\nOutside China, more than 500 cases have been confirmed, mostly of people who traveled from Chinese cities, with five deaths.\n\nRestrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles, apart from essential services, banned from the roads and companies told to stay shut until further notice.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Tracking China's novel coronavirus - here)\n\nRECESSION FEARS\n\nAcross China many factories remain closed following the extended Lunar New Year holiday, disrupting supply chains around the world.\n\nRatings agency Moody\u2019s revised downward GDP growth forecasts for China to 5.2% in 2020.

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday that a recession was a possibility.\n\nSingapore is set to unveil measures to cushion the blow from the epidemic on Tuesday.

So it was striking that a few of the more important and unusual comments from Powell\u2019s presser last week went largely unnoticed. Allow me to correct that here.\n\nFirst, a bit of context. A few weeks ago, Powell attended a \u201cFedListens\u201d conference in Chicago. It\u2019s something of a listening tour for the Fed to help review its \u201cmonetary policy strategy, tools, and communications.\u201d As part of the initiative, the central bank is holding numerous conferences throughout the year, during which it can hear from outsiders to help inform its review.\n\nDuring one panel in Chicago, Maurice Jones, president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), a national organization that works with local partners to bring economic opportunity to places that have too little of it, was asked by the moderator, Boston Fed president Eric Rosengren, about the implications of tight labor markets \u2014 meaning low unemployment, such as we have at the moment \u2014 for the low-income communities that LISC serves.\n\n\u201cThe best thing for them is prolonged, low unemployment,\u201d Jones replied. \u201cNo question about it. \u2026 Businesses are coming to us \u2026 they were not coming to us before this period. ... From the standpoint of fighting poverty, the longer we can have low unemployment, the better, and that\u2019s what we wish for.\u201d\n\nBut the Fed has historically seen a prolonged period of low unemployment as a dilemma \u2014 it could lead to ever-higher inflation. And when that happens, the Fed might need to slam the brakes and raise interest rates, which could then lead to a recession. Given that the least advantaged get hurt the most by recessions, Rosengren asked Jones whether he worried about that potential scenario.\n\nJones was unmoved. \u201cFor the communities that we work in, recession has been a constant for years. They don\u2019t fear recession. That\u2019s their lives,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the chance to have the opportunity to get work is the primary \u2026 they\u2019ll take that risk.\u201d\n\nNow fast-forward to Powell\u2019s press conference last week. Powell was asked to comment on the fact that even with unemployment at a 50-year low, the Fed is contemplating lowering, not raising, the benchmark interest rate it controls.\n\nPowell\u2019s response was noteworthy:\n\nThe reason why we say sustain the expansion is, you\u2019re seeing now for the first time \u2026 communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn\u2019t been earlier. You\u2019re 10 years deep into this, and that\u2019s something we heard quite a lot at the conference in Chicago on the review \u2026 it\u2019s one of the reasons why we think it\u2019s so important to sustain the expansion and keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven\u2019t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time.\n\nA few questions later, he again referenced the panels in Chicago, saying that \u201cfor someone who does this work, [the panels were] very focusing and motivating too. \u2026 Some people recommended that we just talked to, you know, econ PhDs about this, but no, that\u2019s not what we chose to do and we\u2019re glad this is the choice we made.\u201d\n\nNow, this may sound like common sense \u2014 that people in elite positions with great economic power should hear about the impact of their actions on people whose economic opportunities depend on those actions. But such communication is as rare as it is important. That Powell not only sat and listened to these panels but also appears to have quickly incorporated the information into his thinking is a good sign.\n\nIt\u2019s a tricky economic moment from the Fed\u2019s perspective, as the jobless rate is well below levels that have historically signaled current or forthcoming price pressures. Historically, at such times the central bank has often raised rates preemptively, shutting down the possibility of a prolonged period of low unemployment to avoid accelerating inflation. Yet now, in part due to inflation dynamics I get into below, they\u2019re re-weighting the classic trade-off between unemployment and inflation more in favor of low unemployment \u2014 and thus of less advantaged workers.\n\nThe benefits of high-pressure labor markets to the most economically vulnerable\n\nThere\u2019s strong evidence behind the claims of the benefits of high-pressure labor markets \u2014 periods when the unemployment rate stays well below its historical trend \u2014 to those too often left behind. Recent research I did with UMass Boston sociologist Keith Bentele finds that in tight labor markets, the annual earnings of all low-income, working-age households grow 6 percent faster than in slack labor markets.\n\nFor low-income African Americans and single mothers, the differences are 8 and a whopping 13 percent, respectively.\n\nAnnual earnings combine the contribution of hourly wages and annual hours worked, and the latter is, much as Jones\u2019s and Powell\u2019s commentary suggests, a big reason for those earnings gains. The figure below on the left shows a clear, negative correlation between unemployment and annual hours worked for low-income, working-age households. In contrast, the random scatter of dots in the figure on the right shows that labor supply for high-income families is insensitive to the jobless rate.\n\nThis data carries important implications about the benefits of tight labor markets. First, as Jones asserts from firsthand knowledge, low-income people respond to tightening labor market conditions, which is one reason I\u2019ve argued that the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to add work requirements to anti-poverty programs are misguided.\n\nSecond, they show that because tight labor markets disproportionately help those with relatively low incomes, high-pressure labor markets have an equalizing effect. Economist Josh Bivens recently wrote that \u201cexcess unemployment may well explain more than a third of the rise in wage inequality since 1979, and likely contributed to the redistribution of income from labor to capital owners.\u201d\n\nThird \u2014 and this is particularly relevant to the Fed \u2014 by both adding hours to the schedules of those already working and pulling in more workers off the sidelines, high-pressure labor markets boost labor supply, providing the economy with more \u201croom to run,\u201d i.e., more non-inflationary growth.\n\nThe diminished costs of high-pressure labor markets\n\nThat said, as Rosengren asked, don\u2019t we have to, at some point, worry about the inflationary costs of tight labor markets?\n\nTo answer that, consider the figure below. It shows (blue line) the unemployment rate falling and staying below the Fed\u2019s estimate of the lowest unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation (red line). That should push inflation up, right? But the green line shows not only that inflation has remained low but also that it has been below the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2 percent for most of the past decade.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s because low unemployment hasn\u2019t juiced wage growth, and thus producers haven\u2019t needed to raise prices to offset higher labor costs, that\u2019s not so. The yellow line shows gradual wage acceleration, which, for the record, is another important benefit of tight labor markets.\n\nWhat this data pattern means is that the Fed can exploit the benefits of prolonged full employment for much longer than would be the case if the correlation between tight labor markets and inflation were stronger.\n\nIn other words, we have the collision between several powerful forces. Unemployment has fallen to levels most economists believed would be inflationary, and yet inflation remains tame. Such low unemployment is both lifting workers\u2019 pay and helping people who\u2019ve long been left behind to climb over steep barriers to labor market entry that hold them back in weaker labor markets.\n\nAnd, perhaps most importantly, at least for now, a uniquely tuned-in Federal Reserve is responding by explicitly touting and supporting these dynamics. That\u2019s good news for the beneficiaries of tight labor markets and, if we\u2019re willing to learn these crucial lessons, for our understanding of how economies and labor markets function.\n\nJared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and was the chief economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden from 2009 to 2011.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-51397956", "authors": [], "title": "Derek Mackay: Scottish finance secretary quits over messages to boy", "text": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Mackay had been widely tipped as a future first minister\n\nScotland's finance secretary has quit hours before delivering his budget amid reports that he messaged a 16-year-old boy on social media.\n\nThe Scottish Sun said that Derek Mackay contacted the schoolboy over a six-month period, and told him that he was \"cute\".\n\nMr Mackay said he had \"behaved foolishly\" and took full responsibility for his actions.\n\nHe also apologised \"unreservedly\" to the boy and his family.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she did not know about Mr Mackay's \"unacceptable\" behaviour until Wednesday evening, and is \"not aware of any further allegations\" against him.\n\nIn a statement to the Scottish Parliament, she confirmed that he has been suspended by the SNP while further investigations are carried out.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nicola Sturgeon: \u201cIt was unacceptable and falls seriously below the standard required of a minister.\"\n\nPolice Scotland said it had not received any complaint of criminality, but was \"assessing available information from media information\".

It can also involve invitations to events, taking them on trips or even holidays.\n\nGrooming was defined in Scots law as a criminal offence by the Protection of Children and Prevention of Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2005.\n\nIt said an offence is committed if someone meets a young person who is under 16, having met or communicated with them with the intention of engaging in unlawful sexual activity. The maximum penalty for the offence is 10 years imprisonment.\n\nThere has been no suggestion in the Scottish Sun's story that Derek Mackay communicated with the boy when he was under the age of 16.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/modern-warfare-warzone-leak-claims-to-reveal-progression-modes-armor-1337574", "authors": [], "title": "Modern Warfare Warzone leak claims to reveal progression, modes, armor", "text": "Notorious Call of Duty leaker TheGamingRevolution has claimed to reveal more details about Modern Warfare's unreleased Warzone battle royale, including player progression, level cap, modes, Plunder, and armor.\n\nSince the launch of Modern Warfare Season 2, there have been a lot of rumors and speculation about Warzone, a yet-to-be-announced battle royale mode that's supposedly coming soon.\n\nHowever, the information that the player-base has been made privy to has come almost exclusively from leaks and unnamed sources, mainly because Activision and Infinity Ward haven't even officially acknowledged the BR's existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYouTuber TheGamingRevolution, who's made quite a name for himself over the past year data-mining info about Modern Warfare, published yet another leak video on March 5.\n\nIn the video, he goes over details about several specific aspects of Warzone, based on intel he's found in the game's back-end files. A full breakdown of it all can be found below.\n\nAll of this, of course, should be treated as unofficial speculation, since nothing can be considered official until Activision and/or Infinity Ward start making announcements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlayer progression & level cap\n\nTheGamingRevolution claimed that the player progression and leveling up in Warzone will be directly tied with multiplayer, meaning players will have a single level that covers both modes and anything they do in either will continue to level them up in that season's Battle Pass.\n\nThis means that the mode will also have a level cap at 155. At the end of every season, when everyone's level resets back down to 55, players will have another 100 combined levels to grind for in both the BR and multiplayer, which could keep the new mode from getting stale too quickly.\n\nRead More: Full Warzone BR map allegedly leaked\n\nHowever, a lot of players have already reached that max level of 155 in Season 2, so if Warzone does end up getting released prior to Season 3, then those players will start the BR without having anything to grind for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother issue is that if Warzone will indeed be a standalone game free to everyone, which several sources have suggested, those who do own the game may have a distinct advantage over those who don't since they'll have alternate ways to level up their account and get quicker access to new in-game content.\n\nIn fact, TheGamingRevolution went as far as to say that certain areas of the BR could end up being made exclusive to those who own MW, as a way to incentivize people to purchase the full game.\n\n\"Essentially, if this is indeed correct, I think your level cap within Warzone is going to be capped if you don't purchase the full game,\" he said. \"How BS is that? It's great that they're making Warzone free-to-play, but don't limit the mode just to entice people to buy the full game. It should be able to stand on its own.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlood Money mode\n\nA new mode that the YouTuber introduced in his video is called Blood Money, although he did say he doesn't know much about it other than the name and the fact it'll most likely be centered around Plunder, the mode's in-game currency.\n\nHe believes it could be a special playlist in Warzone that gives players additional objectives or missions, much like heists in Grand Theft Auto V, which will allow players to earn more Plunder.\n\nThis was another area of the game that TheGamingRevolution suggests could be behind a pay wall, as game files indicate that the mode may only be available to those who own Modern Warfare.\n\nPlunder and armor\n\nSpeaking of Plunder, the leaker did talk a bit about the currency in his video, primarily the fact that there will be \"banks\" and \"ATMs\" spread all over the map that players will be able to deposit their money at for XP.\n\nHowever, he did discuss that there could be an issue with this concept in that players might not want to use their cash for XP since they can level up their account using multiplayer anyway.\n\nPlunder can also be used to purchase items from equipment stashes found on the map, one of them being armor. The YouTuber claimed that armor will come in the form of plates and that players will be able to carry a maximum of three at a time.\n\nRead More: Leaked animations for Warzone battle royale\n\nIt looks like Infinity Ward have done away with having different tiers of armor, much like Black Ops 4's Blackout BR, and instead will make them all uniform.\n\nHere's TheGamingRevolution's March 5 video in its entirety:\n\nThere is still no set release date for Warzone in Modern Warfare, and figuring out when the mode will finally make its debut has been difficult since Activision and Infinity Ward have remained virtually silent about it.\n\nAs always, we will continue to bring you the latest news on the BR mode as more information becomes available.

And the problem is what people will do to try to sell you a false bill of goods is take one study and blow that study out as though it's the entire picture, when of course it isn't. Imagine you have a massive painting but I only showed you this tiny piece of the painting but you had no idea what the hell else was going on over here there, there's no way you could get an accurate read on if this is a sad picture, a happy picture, like there's no way you could know, correct?\n\nSo when we look at keto here's why we're saying, or not me, but here's where some of the advocates are espousing benefits. Well, what are we doing with keto? We're removing carbohydrates, anything that elevates you got about 20 grams of carbohydrates a day that you're ingesting, which is essentially nothing, it's about 80 calories worth of carbohydrates out of what could be anywhere from a 1600 to 2500 calories a day diet so that's nothing. And it throws your body into a state of emergency that's what ketosis is. And because we don't have any glucose or glycogen, any blood sugar or stored blood sugar, we turn to fat quickly. We produce ketones and the idea is we burn through fat and we lose fat fast. And that is true and you would think that would be a good thing. And in addition, people will say well I reversed my type two diabetes. Of course your insulin level was through the floor, you're consuming zero carbohydrates so you have no blood sugar so your pancreas is not releasing insulin. And this can also affect conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome and by virtue of that connection it can also affect fertility. Fair. Let's give it that.\n\nBut here's what we're not talking about, there's zero calorie restriction on a ketogenic diet so you have a massive amount of oxidative stress, there's no consideration of timing with regard to food so your autophagy process is totally out of whack\n\nIn addition to that it's very high in animal fats and animal proteins. So we're seeing that diets rich in saturated fats are poor for our telomeres oxidative stress, increased inflammation, your nutrient sensing pathways that are related to the health of your metabolism are overrun with constant food, heavy fats, lots of animal protein and we know it hurts your telomeres and on and on and on.\n\nNow, what about the benefits? Is it worth it? Let me tell you, the number one way to sensitize somebody's body, again to insulin, is exercise. I've been doing this a heck of a long time, I reversed type two diabetes, I've helped people get off all medications for type two diabetes and POCOS and get pregnant after years of trying and failing through a commonsense diet where we don't eat too much, we eat real food and we have balanced macronutrients. So I can give you all those benefits with none of the negative side effects of keto. And last thought on keto, we're stripping our body of certain fruits, which have a ton of antioxidants and polyphenols in them. So again, when we look at oxidative stress and free radicals and how they're aging us we need to look at antioxidant foods that help to combat that. When you start cutting out digestive enzymes and papaya and pineapple and mango and all the beta-carotene, which is one of the top things to help keep your telomeres long, something like keto is detrimental on so many different levels. And the amount of benefit is so small when we can take a completely different path get all the benefit over here, none of the negatives over here and all the benefits over there.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://whodatdish.com/2019/10/15/new-orleans-saints-planning-time-without-alvin-kamara/", "authors": ["Tony Twillie", "Roy Anderson", "Tom Sunderland"], "title": "The New Orleans Saints are planning for time without Alvin Kamara", "text": "NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA - OCTOBER 06: Alvin Kamara #41 of the New Orleans Saints warms up before a game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at the Mercedes Benz Superdome on October 06, 2019 in New Orleans, Louisiana.

This development doesn\u2019t bode well for the little we know about Kamara\u2019s ankle and now knee injury.\n\nThat said, the Saints are looking to workout Travaris Cadet. With Dwayne Washington and Latavius Murray still in the backfield even if Kamara misses time, it\u2019d odd that the Saints are looking elsewhere for another body.\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019ll be interesting to see who the Saints opt to cut for Cadet if he is indeed brought on. This isn\u2019t concern for the player cut or Cadet, but the Saints chances if Kamara is going to miss time.\n\nLike Jacksonville did, teams will fall into coverage. Teddy Bridgewater will be forced to beat them. He beat Tampa Bay but failed to really get going against the Jags. Overall, Bridgewater has heavily benefited from the presence of Alvin Kamara.\n\nThe 5-foot-10 back left after a season-low 11 carries on Sunday.\n\nWant your voice heard? Join the Who Dat Dish team! Write for us!\n\nAlthough he did manage eight targets, Kamara certainly didn\u2019t look like his versatile, shifty self. That said, it is possible that the Saints are just preparing to rest Kamara to get him the relief he needs to bounce back at full strength.\n\nWhile not an official report, the Spun\u2019s Chris Rosvoglou is also spectating that Kamara may miss the team\u2019s upcoming matchup.\n\nTwo thoughts here 1.

That\u2019s not to say that they wouldn\u2019t miss the back that\u2019s had over 1,500 yards from scrimmage in both his first and second season in the league.\n\nBe prepared for more Kamara news in the coming days.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Tue Oct 15 01:23:19 +0000 2019", "id": 1183916227028291584, "id_str": "1183916227028291584", "full_text": "Two thoughts here\n\n1.

since the outbreak was announced, with 24,000 people receiving vaccinations since last Wednesday as part of a mass immunisation campaign.\n\nHowever some desperate parents are still turning to questionable alternative healers to help alleviate their children's measles symptoms.\n\nAuthorities have made measles vaccinations compulsory under law and publicly warned people against discouraging others from receiving vaccinations.\n\nAnxiety was also growing in neighbouring countries battling their own smaller-scale measles outbreaks.\n\nFijian authorities have restricted public vaccinations due to a shortage of supplies, prioritising people living in the most affected areas, children aged between six months and three years, and people travelling overseas.\n\nHowever this has seen some concerned parents turned away from health centres.\n\nThe country has had 13 confirmed measles cases so far, according to local media, but no deaths.\n\nFiji's Government was expecting an additional

It's to jump start your Jazz fandom before work, school, or a long day watching the kids.\n\nAnthony Davis\n\nJames Harden\n\nDamian Lillard\n\nDeMar DeRozan\n\nBradley Beal\n\nEric Gordon\n\nTobias Harris\n\nCJ McCollum\n\nKevin Love\n\nThis is the complete list of NBA players that have withdrawn themselves from the Team USA roster prior to the FIBA World Cup next month. These players represented the biggest and brightest of the NBA\u2019s stars included in Team USA\u2019s roster, and now the American squad will be forced to play without them.\n\nAmid all of these players pulling from the FIBA World Cup, Utah\u2019s Donovan Mitchell has stayed firm in his commitment to the national squad.\n\nUtah Jazz emerging star Donovan Mitchell is keeping his commitment to USA Basketball this summer, league sources tell Yahoo Sports.\n\nThis news from the other day created quite the stir of a discussion on social media platforms the other day among Jazz fans. Some were stoked to see Mitchell keep this commitment with the opportunity ahead of him. Others were disappointed, in good faith of course, just simply wanting to protect him and ensure he was at full strength for the start of the NBA season months down the road. Both sides have their valid arguments. In terms of opportunity, however, this is going to be a great experience for Donovan Mitchell.\n\nMitchell has accomplished much more in his first two seasons than your normal NBA player. 40-point games, signature shoe and other endorsement deals, player of the week awards, TV exposure, international fans, playoff wins, dunk contest, and the list goes on and on. This dude\u2019s NBA career escalated very quickly. With such rapid progression in just two seasons, it feels right that Donovan Mitchell is getting another great accomplishment under his belt being invited to (and most likely making) the Team USA roster. It\u2019s no small feat, no matter how you look at it.\n\nQuite possibly the greatest good that will come from Donovan Mitchell\u2019s Team USA stint is the overall experience that will be added to his game. Spending time in practices, film study and traveling with some of the most successful coaches of this era in Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr will great for Donovan. It will be good for him to learn from coaches with extensive championship experience. Mitchell has mentioned several times before how he loves to be a \u201csponge\u201d whenever he\u2019s working out or training with NBA veterans. Can you imagine how much he\u2019s going to soak in talking with Gregg Popovich?\n\nIt\u2019s also going to be very beneficial for Mitchell to rub shoulders with other NBA stars. Being able to pick the brain of five-time All-Star and NBA champion Kyle Lowry should be plenty of information just by itself. Even though Lowry isn\u2019t the biggest star in basketball per se, he performed at a high level winning an NBA championship, and that\u2019s something that Donovan needs to learn about. Throw in guys like Kemba Walker and Khris Middleton as well and there\u2019s still some great talent on this USA roster for Donovan to learn from. Mitchell\u2019s also going to be practicing and scrimmaging against his fellow up-and-coming stars like Jayson Tatum, Kyle Kuzma, and Jaylen Brown, who are all actually pretty good friends with Mitchell already. This experience with these guys might just be enough to sway them in future free-agency decisions too, you just never know.\n\nLast but not least, playing for Team USA is going to be some great exposure for Donovan Mitchell. Exposure might not be a problem for Mitchell at the moment, but you can never get enough. If he leads the squad in scoring (which is not that crazy to say, considering the roster) and guides them to a gold medal, there\u2019s going to be a great amount of exposure added from this. It might help him in future All-Star voting being on display for the entire world to see. It might make a positive impact on coaches and media, sufficient to alter votes in his favor in All-NBA or other awards when it comes down to a narrow margin. As long as Mitchell can stay healthy (please Basketball Gods, we beg you), this is going to be a very positive thing for him.\n\nI\u2019m really excited to watch Donovan Mitchell play for Team USA. I\u2019ve always loved watching Olympic and other international basketball competitions, and now getting to watch Mitchell play is going to be so much fun. It\u2019s a new chapter in the book of Donovan Mitchell, and I\u2019m here for it. It\u2019s going to be a great opportunity for Spida, and if it goes like everything else in his career has thus far, it\u2019s going to be really special.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Tue Jul 23 15:23:53 +0000 2019", "id": 1153687182793748480, "id_str": "1153687182793748480", "full_text": "Utah Jazz emerging star Donovan Mitchell is keeping his commitment to USA Basketball this summer, league sources tell Yahoo Sports.", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 131], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": []}, "source": "<a href=\"http://twitter.com/download/iphone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for iPhone</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 57710919, "id_str": "57710919", "name": "Chris Haynes", "screen_name": "ChrisBHaynes", "location": "", "description": "Senior NBA Insider for Yahoo Sports.

Most of the activity remained confidential, but Democrats' impeachment inquiry has since brought some of it into the open.\n\nMuch of the testimony about the Ukraine affair remains sealed, but some accounts have emerged in the form of written opening statements and in characterizations by those who heard it.\n\nLoading...\n\nJohn Bolton\n\nSome of the officials who've been described as most uncomfortable with Trump's actions were those closest to it at the policymaking level.\n\nThen-National Security Adviser John Bolton, a lifelong Russia hawk, was described as objecting to Trump's policy on its merits: Holding up military assistance for Ukraine to help it resist Russian military activity was antithetical to Bolton's worldview.\n\nBolton, like many other national security and foreign policy professionals in the Trump administration, is also said to have objected that Trump deputized his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to handle the Ukraine portfolio in parallel with official channels.\n\nGiuliani was \"a hand grenade who is going to blow everybody up,\" Bolton was described as warning, according to accounts of testimony by Fiona Hill, a Bolton deputy, before House investigators. Bolton also was said to have compared the Ukraine situation to a \"drug deal.\"\n\nThat caution proved prescient as the Ukraine affair escalated quickly \u2014 in Washington terms \u2014 from a kerfuffle about foreign policy into the basis for Democrats' impeachment inquiry.\n\nMore than one witness has been described as telling House investigators that Bolton encouraged them to report their concerns about the Ukraine policy to their various superiors, either within the National Security Council or within the State Department.\n\nWhat remains unclear is how strongly Bolton registered his own objections, if that's what they were, with his own supervisor: Trump. Investigators likely will press Bolton about this and more if he appears for a closed-door deposition before the impeachment committees this week.\n\nFiona Hill\n\nFiona Hill was a top Russia specialist on the National Security Council who has been described as dubious about the plan to pressure Ukraine to undertake investigations that might help Trump politically.\n\nHill also has been described as telling House investigators that Bolton encouraged her to report her concerns within the National Security Council, including the departures from protocol embodied in Giuliani's involvement with the parallel channel to Kyiv.\n\nHouse investigators have scheduled a deposition on Monday with White House lawyer John Eisenberg, whom Hill is believed to have approached.\n\nOther White House officials also have been invited to give depositions, but it isn't clear whether they or Eisenberg will appear, given the Trump administration's rejection of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nEisenberg also reportedly has been described as working to limit access to accounts of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy \u2014 a call in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to launch investigations that might help his 2020 campaign as a \"favor.\"\n\nAlexander Vindman\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman is the top Ukraine specialist on the National Security Council. He listened to the July 25 call and is said to have told House investigators that he raised concerns about it immediately.\n\nVindman is understood to have approached Eisenberg and, according to his opening statement to House investigators, said he believed Trump's request of Zelenskiy not only was wrong but contravened U.S. strategic interests.\n\nSince 2014, when Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States has been providing assistance to Kyiv to help it against Russian and Russian-backed forces inside its borders.\n\nThe Ukraine affair centers on the efforts to condition the next tranche of that aid on Zelenskiy's willingness to accommodate Trump. The White House ordered that nearly $400 million in assistance be frozen in the summer and ultimately restored it in September.\n\nAlthough Trump and other White House officials have acknowledged that they expected concessions from Ukraine, they've also said that nothing about this arrangement was improper and specifically that there was no \"quid pro quo\" of engagement or aid for political assistance.\n\nVindman is said to have documented his objections and pushed within the administration for Trump to reverse his pressure strategy. He also reportedly told members of Congress that he sought to restore key terms to the White House account of Trump's call with Zelenskiy.\n\nThat account has been an important element in the Ukraine affair. Two top diplomats \u2014 Gordon Sondland and William Taylor \u2014 said they received accounts of the call that either didn't mention the political requests or otherwise omitted problematic aspects of the conversation.\n\nMichael McKinley\n\nOnce a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, diplomat Michael McKinley resigned out of frustration with the Ukraine affair.\n\nMcKinley is believed to have objected to the scourging of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, who may have been recalled because she would not go along with Giuliani's parallel channel of pressure on Kyiv.\n\nMcKinley is said to have told members of Congress that he sought a public defense of Yovanovitch \u2014 but State Department officials wouldn't go along. More broadly, he reportedly said, McKinley worried about what he called the use of diplomats to \"advance a domestic political objective.\"\n\nWilliam Taylor\n\nWilliam Taylor is the interim boss of the U.S. diplomatic mission in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.\n\nHe told members of Congress that Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, revealed to him that Trump wanted Zelenskiy trapped \"in a public box\" \u2014 committing to investigations that Trump wanted \u2014 in order to secure U.S. military assistance for Ukraine and a coveted Oval Office meeting.\n\nTaylor told investigators that he supports a strong U.S. relationship with Ukraine and that he opposed the pressure policy. When Bolton visited Kyiv in August, Taylor said, he voiced his concerns about the Giuliani back channel and the principle of leaning on Zelenskiy.\n\nBolton encouraged him to record his objections on the record in a cable to Pompeo, Taylor said \u2014 which he then did.\n\nInsiders and supporters\n\nThe Ukraine affair has been unusual in the context of Washington scandals, in part because so many facts about it have emerged so quickly \u2014 and remain largely uncontested by Trump.\n\nAlthough the president and his supporters have slammed what they call Democrats' \"sham\" impeachment inquiry for being unfair, they also have defended the merits of the underlying conduct at issue.\n\nTrump continues to insist that his call with Zelenskiy was \"absolutely perfect,\" and he and others have said it's legitimate for the United States to expect guarantees about \"corruption\" before extending hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., described what he called Trump's \"legitimate actions\" in the Ukraine affair in rejecting Democrats' legislation to formalize the inquiry on Thursday.\n\nThere also have been witnesses from inside the administration who are described as having verified some facts about the story without objecting to them. Timothy Morrison, the Russia specialist who replaced Hill on the National Security Council, was described as having been willing to verify the recollections of other witnesses.\n\nBut Morrison, according to accounts of his testimony, evidently did not belong to those who viewed Trump's actions as illegal or improper. Although they complicated the Western posture against Russia, Morrison is said to have believed the president was within his rights.\n\nSondland's situation appears to be among the most complicated. Although Taylor quoted Sondland to House investigators as having attributed the Ukraine pressure policy directly to the president, Sondland said that for his part, he didn't piece the picture together until later.\n\nMoreover, Sondland said, with the perspective he had by the time of his deposition in October, he reached the point at which he opposed Trump's actions, or the principle of any president inviting a foreign government to interfere in an election.\n\nHouse investigators have more depositions scheduled, and then they plan to open public hearings to discuss their findings. The remainder of the process could reveal more about whether anyone else inside the government spoke about what they were observing before the impeachment inquiry \u2014 or whether they will now, to Congress.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bionano-genomics-announces-proposed-underwritten-210100985.html", "authors": [], "title": "Bionano Genomics Announces Proposed Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock", "text": "TipRanks\n\nWith the Georgia election behind us, and the Trump Administration on the way out, the near- to mid-term political landscape is growing clearer: The Biden Administration will be able to cater to its progressive base, now that it rests on majorities \u2013 however thin \u2013 in both Houses of Congress. Predictability is good for the markets, and we\u2019re likely to have that, at least until 2022. Which makes this the time to lock in the defensive portfolio plays.The research analysts at Wells Fargo have been searching the markets for the \u2018right\u2019 buys, and their picks bear a closer look. They\u2019ve been tapping high-yielding dividend payers as an investment play of choice.The TipRanks database sheds some additional light on three of the firm's picks \u2013 stocks with dividends yielding 8% or better.Apollo Investment Corporation (AINV)One good place to look for high return dividends is among the market\u2019s business development companies. These companies offer specialty financing to the middle market, providing credit and funding for small to medium business customers who would otherwise have difficulty accessing capital markets.Apollo Investment is a typical example, with an investment portfolio valued at $2.59 billion. Apollo has investments in 147 companies, with average exposure of $15.9 million. The bulk of its portfolio, 86%, is first lien secured debt. Healthcare, business services, aviation and transport, and high-tech companies make up more than half of Apollo\u2019s investment targets.In Q3CY20 (the company\u2019s fiscal Q2 of 2021), Apollo posted an EPS of 43 cents per share, flat sequentially but down 18% year-over-year. The company boasted $268 million available liquid assets, and $287 million in available credit under its secured facility at the end of the quarter. Since then, Apollo has amended its revolving credit facility by extending maturity to December 2025.On the dividend front, Apollo has maintained its payments to regular shareholders despite the corona pandemic. Apollo\u2019s most recent payment, in November, was s 31-cent regular dividend plus a 5-cent special dividend. The current yield is an impressive 11.6%.Covering AINV for Well Fargo, analyst Finian O\u2019Shea noted, \u201cLegacy\u2019s impact has whittled away, adding just $3 million to the top line this quarter, for an annualized yield on FV of ~5.5%. We think there is very little downside to NOI from the legacy book, and view any realizations and re-deployments as a big positive to the stock.\u201dO\u2019Shea gives Apollo an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and a price target which, at $12.50, implies a 12% upside from current levels. (To watch O\u2019Shea\u2019s track record, click here)Overall, Apollo has two reviews on record, and they are split \u2013 1 Buy and 1 Hold \u2013 for a Moderate Buy consensus view. The stock is selling for $11.17, and its $11.50 average price target suggests a modest 3% upside. (See AINV stock analysis on TipRanks)Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD)Next up, Goldman Sachs BDS, is the banking giant\u2019s entry into the specialty finance business development segment. GSBD is a subsidiary of Goldman, and focuses on mid-market companies, providing closed-end management investment services and middle-market credit access.GSBD\u2019s share performance in 2020 showed a steady rebound from the initial recession caused by the corona crisis last winter. By year\u2019s end, the stock was trading its January 2020 levels.In November, the company felt confident enough to price an offering of $500 million in unsecured notes, at interest of 2.875% and due in January 2026. The funds raised will be used to pay down the revolving credit facility, improving interest on existing debt.Also in November, GSBD reported 80 cents EPS for the quarter ending September 30. The earnings were strong enough to support a solid dividend of 45 cents per share \u2013 and the company announced a special dividend payment, of 15 cents, to be paid in three installments during 2021. The regular dividend currently has a yield exceeding 9%.Among the bulls is Wells Fargo's Finian O\u2019Shea, who also covers AINV. The analyst wrote, \"[We] believe the high-quality investment platform and shareholder friendly structure will continue to drive attractive forward returns\u2026 GSBD is quality at a good price... For those who buy BDCs, GSBD will likely always be in the portfolio discussion as we see it, given its quality of earnings and shareholder orientation.\u201dWith that in mind, O\u2019Shea rates GSBD an Overweight (i.e. Buy), along with a $19.50 price target. This figure implies a 5% upside from current levels. (To watch O\u2019Shea\u2019s track record, click here)Once again, this is a stock with an even split between Buy and Hold reviews, making for a Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating. The shares are priced at $18.59 and the average price target of $19.50 matches O\u2019Shea\u2019s. (See GSBD stock analysis on TipRanks)ExxonMobil (XOM)From BDCs we\u2019ll move on to the oil industry. Exxon Mobil is one of Big Oil\u2019s players, with a market cap of $190 billion and 2019 revenues (the last year for which full-year figures are available) of $264.9 billion. The company produces approximately 2.3 billion barrels of oil equivalent daily, putting it in the top five of global hydrocarbon producers.Low prices in 2H19, and the corona crisis in 1H20, drove revenues down in the first part of last year \u2013 but that reversed in Q3 when XOM reported $45.7 billion at the top line. While down year-over-year, this was up 40% sequentially.Despite all of the headwinds facing the oil industry over the past 18 months, XOM has kept its dividend reliable, and paid out the most recent distribution in December 2020. That payment was 87 cents per regular share, annualizing to $3.48 and giving a yield of 8.4%.In a note on the big oil companies, Wells Fargo\u2019s Roger Read writes, \u201cIn 2021, we expect more supportive macro tailwinds, but realize significant challenges exist and maintain an average Brent price below $50\u2026\u201dSwitching his view to XOM in particular, the analyst adds, \u201cWe do not expect production growth and only minimal free cashflow generation, which is inclusive of disposition proceeds. However, this represents a significant change from the last several years of significant cash burns and increased leverage. In our view, this is likely enough to lift the shares a bit higher and lessen worries about dividend sustainability.\u201dIn light of his comments, Read rates XOM shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $53 price target indicates room for 17% upside growth in the coming year. (To watch Read\u2019s track record, click here)That Wall Street still views the energy industry with a cautious eye is clear from XOM\u2019s analyst consensus rating -- Hold. That is based on 10 reviews, including 3 Buys, 6 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are selling for $45.15, and their $47.33 average price target suggests a modest upside of ~5% (See XOM stock analysis on TipRanks)To find good ideas for dividend stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

Beltran played for the Astros in 2017 and was the only player named in commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s report. So for Mendoza to use one job (ESPN) to talk about another job (the Mets) created an inherent conflict of interest.\n\nAs for Cone, Marchand reports ESPN liked how he worked with A-Rod and Michael Kay during a YES Network broadcast last year. The 57-year-old Cone, who threw his hat into the ring to be the Yankees\u2019 pitching coach in 2020, has one year left on his deal with YES.

The spreadsheet shows a number of alleged mobile Ampere chips, including Max-Q and Max-P editions of the GeForce RTX 3080, GeForce RTX 3070, and GeForce RTX 3060.\n\nThe leak raises a number of critical questions. For starters, NVIDIA has yet to formally announce Ampere GPU variants for laptops. Considering the current supply shortage on the desktop side, it'll be interesting to see exactly when notebook Ampere hardware makes it to market. The other big question here is with regards to performance.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3080 and GeForce RTX 3090 deliver phenomenal 4K gaming performance, but at the cost of drawing immense amounts of power. The GeForce RTX 3080 has a TDP of 320W, with AIB parts going to 350W and beyond. To put this into perspective, the GeForce RTX 2080 (mobile) has a TDP of just 150W, while Max-Q parts are even more frugal at 90W. GA102 is a massive GPU, requiring lots of power to run at reasonable clocks. It'll be interesting to see just how much performance NVIDIA manages to extract out of its mobile iteration.\n\nThe GeForce RTX 3070 Max-Q and GeForce RTX 3060 Max-Q, based on smaller GPUs, could presumably offer a meaningful performance improvement over notebook Turing. It remains to be seen how OEMs will configure cooling for these power-hungry Ampere GPUs.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/27432038/loyola-sister-jean-celebrates-100th-birthday", "authors": ["Elizabeth Merrill", "Jeff Borzello", "Mark Schlabach"], "title": "Loyola's Sister Jean celebrates 100th birthday", "text": "Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, the chaplain for the Loyola-Chicago men's basketball team, turned 100 on Wednesday.\n\nAmong the ways Sister Jean is being celebrated is a Lego likeness of her that will be on display at the Legoland Discovery Center through October, when it will be moved to the Ramblers' Gentile Arena.\n\nShe is also getting an exhibit at the Loyola University Museum of Art.\n\n\"I've never celebrated a month before, but why not, you only get to be 100 only once,\" she told WGN-TV Chicago this week. \"That's like being Cinderella, only once.\"\n\nSister Jean became a sensation during Loyola's 2018 run to the Final Four, when the nun was a spry 98.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/19/trump-asap-rocky-swedish-custody-1422644", "authors": ["Maya King"], "title": "President Trump calls for A$AP Rocky's release from Swedish custody", "text": "A$AP Rocky was arrested in Sweden three weeks ago after an altercation that Swedish authorities say they suspect was an assault. | Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Photos legal President Trump calls for A$AP Rocky's release from Swedish custody\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump plan to negotiate for rapper A$AP Rocky to be released from Swedish custody, adding that the artist has \u201ctremendous support from the African American community in this country.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s comments come in response to Swedish prosecutors\u2019 decision to keep the rapper, born Rakim Mayers, in custody for another week \u201cbecause of the flight risk.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA$AP Rocky and two friends were arrested in Sweden three weeks ago after an altercation that Swedish authorities say they suspect was an assault.

Left tackle, right tackle, left guard, right guard and center. Everyone tried and failed at least once against Smith, who bullied his way to one of the most impressive performances from a Packers edge rusher this decade. He beat left tackle Riley Reiff for a pair of early pressures on the first drive, patiently worked inside Reiff and dumped Mike Boone for a 2-yard loss, swatted past Reiff and hunted down Kirk Cousins for his first sack, bench-pressed right guard Josh Kline and dropped Boone for another loss, side-stepped rookie center Garrett Bradbury from the A-gap and tripped up Cousins for another sack, drove right tackle Brian O\u2019Neil deep into the pocket and combined with Preston Smith for a sack and all but ended the proceedings by stunting inside and whipping Bradbury for a third-down sack at the two-minute warning. He had four or five other play-disrupting pressures not even mentioned above. It was an All-Pro performance, and maybe the best individual performance from a Packers player this season.\n\nDL Kenny Clark: Clark getting healthy might be the single most important turning point of the Packers season. He\u2019s been terrific over the last six games. Not surprisingly, the defense has come alive over that same span. Clark and Bradbury will be battling twice a year for years to come, but the first two battles were technical knockouts comfortably awarded to No. 97. He is too big, powerful and quick for the rookie (and most other centers). At times, he simply walked Bradbury back two or three yards and re-established the line of scrimmage. His sack was just an impressive individual effort. He worked off the right guard moving to his right, got to Bradbury and beat him with a quick swim move and then closed on Cousins in an instant. Earlier in the second half, Clark easily pressed Bradbury into the backfield and tripped up Boone for no gain. Za\u2019Darius Smith was the star, but Clark was a worthy supporting actor in textbook destruction of an offensive line.\n\nRB Aaron Jones: Others might have turtled into a shell after fumbling on the opening drive of a primetime showdown. Not Jones. He kept hacking away at the Vikings defense and eventually used his superstar abilities to crack the game wide open. The Vikings resisted early, but the 4- and 5-yard gains added up. Running against an increasingly fatigued opponent in the second half, Jones and his devastating quickness delivered staggering blows. He burst off the left side, cutting inside of Allen Lazard\u2019s block and finding the end zone for the go-ahead score. A quarter later, he all but ended the game when he got outside, wiggled through the smallest of openings and then turned on the jets down the sideline for a 56-yard score. The Vikings\u2019 pursuit couldn\u2019t catch him. He\u2019s special.\n\nCB Kevin King: If Clark is the linchpin of the defensive front, King might be the fulcrum of the secondary. When he\u2019s on, like he was Monday night, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to throw the football against the Packers defense. He was targeted four times and gave up just one catch. He stopped Adam Thielen short of the sticks on a third-down jet sweep and later stuffed rookie tight end Irv Smith Jr. behind the line after a quick throw and catch. Of course, King also provided the game-changing play. He got terrific depth in his Cover-3 zone and put himself into an ideal position to intercept Kirk Cousins\u2019 deep ball in the third quarter. It was a smart and athletic play, and his long return set up a Packers touchdown. With Jaire Alexander handling Stefon Diggs for much of the night, King saw plenty of Thielen, who didn\u2019t have a single catch.\n\nRT Bryan Bulaga: An incredible season from an incredible player rolled on Monday night. For the second time this season, Bulaga went head-to-head with Danielle Hunter \u2013 arguably the game\u2019s top young edge-rusher \u2013 and scored a victory. Hunter had one sack but it was on the quarterback. Bulaga otherwise eliminated him from the contest. According to Pro Football Focus, Bulaga and Hunter faced off on 70 pass-blocking snaps this season. Bulaga held him to just four total pressures, including zero sacks and zero quarterback hits.\n\nLT David Bakhtiari: Everson Griffen wasn\u2019t inactive. He just got swallowed whole by a three-time All-Pro left tackle who is playing more and more like an All-Pro. Griffen played 59 snaps but finished with only two assisted tackles and no pressures. Bakhtiari looked vulnerable at times the first couple of months of the season, but he\u2019s back to eliminating edge rushers from games.\n\nCB Tramon Williams: The ageless one keeps stringing together impressive games. He essentially created a turnover when he blanketed Adam Thielen\u2019s double-move from the slot on 4th-and-4. He didn\u2019t bite on the slant and Cousins\u2019 throw had no chance, so the Packers took over on downs. He almost picked off Cousins on 3rd-and-5 late in the first half when he undercut Laquon Treadwell\u2019s out route and nearly completed a diving catch. On the Vikings\u2019 first drive of the second half, Williams diagnosed the play and took away the quick slant to Irv Smith Jr. It was Cousins\u2019 first read. He threw elsewhere, and it fell incomplete. Punt. Once again, Williams was terrific covering a number of different players from the slot.\n\nDE Dean Lowry: He and Tyler Lancaster did a lot of the dirty work in the run game. Lowry was in on four different tackles within two yards of the line of scrimmage, and his upfield disruption helped create Za\u2019Darius Smith\u2019s first tackle for loss. He also batted down a pass when he read Cousins\u2019 eyes and got both hands up on a short pass. It was nearly intercepted. He combined with Clark for a stop for no gain after he man-handled Pat Elflein at the point of attack.\n\nDuds\n\nTE Jimmy Graham: He played 40 snaps but was mostly used as a blocker, chipper or as the clear-out man in a route combination. It was an uneventful performance, but Graham nearly made a huge mistake late in the first half when he carried the ball in the wrong hand and allowed the Vikings cornerback to punch it out before he was out of bounds. He really owes Geronimo Allison, who was right there to recover it. Had the Vikings made a clear recovery, the Packers would have had a fourth first-half turnover and lost three points before the half.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/research-suggests-poor-family-relationships-222543431.html", "authors": ["Meghan Overdeep"], "title": "New Research Suggests That Poor Family Relationships Could Be Making You Sick", "text": "The quality of your relationships with your extended family could impact your health more than your spouse as you age.\n\nA new study published by the American Psychological Association in the Journal of Family Psychology found that people who feel unsupported by their extended family\u2014parents, siblings, grandparents, etc.\u2014are more likely to suffer chronic illness than those who are unhappy with their spouse or partner.\n\n\u201cWe found that family emotional climate had a big effect on overall health, including the development or worsening of chronic conditions such as stroke and headaches over the 20-year span of midlife,\u201d Sarah B. Woods, PhD, assistant professor of family and community medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center and lead author of the study, said in a news release. \u201cContrary to previous research, which found that intimate relationships had a large effect on physical health, we did not get the same results.\u201d\n\nThe study looked at data collected on nearly 3,000 people between 1995 and 2014. At three points during those years, people were asked to rate the strain in both their romantic and family relationships.

Surprisingly, there were no significant effects of intimate partner relationships on health outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe were honestly stunned that there were zero associations between intimate partner emotional climate and later health,\u201d Woods said.\n\nThey theorize that it\u2019s related to the fact that partner relationships can break up, whereas family members tend to stick around for life. Family is forever, and for some people, that means a lifetime of emotional wear and tear.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of the people in the study had living parents or siblings and thus, their relationship with a spouse or intimate partner was less likely to be as long as that of their family members,\u201d Patricia N.E.

He is in that conversation at least. But his comparison to a Hall of Fame quarterback who played for the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 division rival raised eyebrows.\n\n\"My numbers are better than Troy Aikman,\" McNabb told TMZ.\n\nWell ...\n\nMcNabb: 167 games, 37,276 yards, 234 TD, 117 INT\n\nAikman: 165 games, 32,942 yards, 165 TD, 141 INT\n\nDon\u2019t forget McNabb\u2019s 3,459 rushing yards and 29 touchdowns.

He played behind an all-time great offensive line, with one of the best running backs ever, on one of the most loaded teams in NFL history. Would Aikman have carried a lesser team to three titles? Likely not.\n\nWe have gone overboard factoring Super Bowl rings into a quarterback\u2019s legacy. Football is a team sport. Quarterbacks don\u2019t play one-on-one, and they certainly don\u2019t win championships on their own.\n\nBut we all know with even one ring, McNabb would be much closer to the Hall. He might be in already. Other great quarterbacks have retired recently or will retire soon, and many of them will likely jump McNabb in line.\n\nMcNabb does have a good Hall of Fame case.

And although we know this illness is dangerous, the hospitalization rate is about 243 hospital stays per 100,000 infections, which means masses of people are having to manage less severe cases at home, too.\n\nPatients are facing time alone with a notoriously unpredictable virus \u2014 and that can feel scary, confusing and overwhelming. Those are all sentiments I've heard a lot in my own practice as a family doctor lately.\n\nIf you've gotten a positive test result, here's advice from doctors about how to handle a mild to moderate, or even asymptomatic, case on your own \u2014 and when you need to seek emergency help.\n\nIsolate yourself from others, starting as quickly as you can\n\nYou've probably heard this one plenty, but it's as important as ever: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 10 days of isolation after a positive coronavirus test if you're asymptomatic, or at least 10 days of isolation from the start of symptoms if you have them. If your positive test was after symptoms started, isolation days would still start counting from the first day of symptoms.\n\nIf you're in this situation and live with other people, it takes a bit of planning to follow that advice. It's important to stay in separate rooms (including during meals and sleep), and everyone else in the house should wear a mask in common areas. Also, be sure to step up the sanitizing of shared surfaces and avoid sharing things such as cups and towels.\n\nMembers of your household and your close contacts need to quarantine, too\n\nIf you've tested positive for the virus, everyone you live with has been exposed, so they, too, will need to quarantine as well as anyone you had close contact with in the two days leading up to your positive test being collected or the start of symptoms.\n\nSo what's close contact? The CDC says 15 cumulative minutes of exposure to the sick person and within 6 feet of them \u2014 even with masks on. It's fair to assume anyone who has been gathering with you, especially indoors, was exposed, so plan to reach out to close contacts and ask them to quarantine.\n\nBut there's new recommendations for how many days they need to quarantine. The CDC still maintains a full 14 days of quarantine after being exposed is the best method to keep from spreading COVID-19, but it now offer alternatives if that's not possible. Exposed people can quarantine 10 days from the exposure if there's no testing and symptoms don't develop, or as few as seven days if there are no symptoms and they get a negative test.\n\nIf the shorter quarantine schedule is followed, exposed people should keep watching closely for symptoms for a full 14 days since an infection can take that long to develop. But keep in mind, these are general recommendations and may differ from state to state depending on the number of cases, so be sure to look up local guidance.\n\nAssess your symptom severity and know when to seek emergency care\n\nIf your symptoms are the common nasal congestion, dry cough, body aches, loss of taste or smell or headache, it's suitable to stay home and treat yourself with rest and plenty of liquids. But be alert to changing symptoms, says Roger Alvarez, a pulmonologist and professor of clinical medicine at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine. He says that although mild to moderate COVID-19 cases can be managed at home, symptoms that start out mild can wax, wane and evolve into severe symptoms that need treatment at a hospital.\n\nRed flag symptoms that suggest you need to call 911 no matter how many days you've been sick include (but aren't limited to): trouble breathing, chest pain, blue lips, confusion, being unable to tolerate food or drink, weakness or feeling like you can't stay awake.\n\nConsider getting a basic oxygen monitor \u2014 a pulse oximeter \u2014 for your finger at home, watching for a drop in your oxygen levels down to 94% or below. When levels drop below this, it's time to call your doctor immediately. If you don't have a primary care provider, go to an urgent care or emergency room \u2014 or, if you feel like you can't breathe, call 911. Similarly, a high fever (above 103 F) that doesn't get lower with fever-reducing medicines is another reason to call, or visit, a doctor.\n\nBut don't get too caught up in the numbers: If you get a feeling that \"something's not right,\" don't delay medical care.\n\nReach out to your doctor, but know there's no magic pill\n\nIf you've just tested positive and started isolating, it's a good time to reach out to your primary care doctor or other health care provider (if you haven't already) and get advice tailored to your symptoms and medical history. This is especially important for patients with any chronic illnesses such as lung disease or diabetes, but also for healthy people.\n\nThe good news? Doctors are easier to reach than ever with the popularity of telephone and video visits, so no need to leave your home to talk to them. The bad news is that COVID-19 is a virus, just like the flu, which means an antibiotic won't stop the illness or the symptoms.\n\nDr. Matthew Anderson, senior medical director of primary care at the University of Wisconsin, tells NPR that he sometimes gives oral steroids to patients with chronic lung disease who get COVID-19 and are wheezing. But he says steroids or other drugs you may have heard about \u2014 including one of the monoclonal antibody cocktails or remdesivir \u2014 \"aren't the standard of care\" for mild or moderate COVID-19, and might do more harm than good in those cases. While there's been lots of talk about those drugs given to patients with severe illness who are hospitalized \u2013 maybe most famously, President Trump \u2013 these treatments aren't currently recommended for milder cases that are best managed at home.\n\nMake an isolation and care plan early, and ask for help\n\nDoctors and health care teams that include nurses and care navigators can also be a good resource for figuring out and lining up the sort of logistical help you'll need to isolate yourself. You won't want to run out of your routine medications, so ask your health team about how to get them via mail order or from pharmacies that deliver.\n\nAlso important: How will you and your quarantining housemates get and keep groceries, toilet paper and other goods in the house? Most cities now have grocery delivery services you can access online; typically health care systems also have social workers that can connect you with other food services if you need them. Make a list of your needs and ask friends for help. If you're isolated and sick, pets will still need to be walked, snow shoveled and bills paid.\n\nRest and rehydrate but try to avoid lingering in bed\n\nIt can feel frustrating if you've got a positive coronavirus test with mild symptoms such as a runny nose or sore throat for which there's no definitive treatment. But that just means you should stick to the well-worn advice for healing from any viral infection: Get extra rest, drink plenty of fluids and take an over-the-counter fever-reducing medicine such as acetaminophen if you need it.\n\nFluids may also be hard to gulp down when you're feeling bad, but dehydration can land people in the hospital on its own. That's especially true for children and older folks, so try to sip plenty of water, juice, soup or electrolyte drinks throughout the day. Noncaffeinated tea with honey might soothe your sore throat, but avoid drinks with lots of sugar or caffeine.\n\nRest is also important to recovery, but be wary of the urge to stay in bed. \"You don't want to overwork yourself but avoid strict bed rest \u2013 we don't want patients to be totally sedentary because we know that patients who move around seem to do better,\" says Alvarez, who has recovered from a case of COVID-19 himself. He encourages patients to walk around their homes as they're able or sit upright on the couch \u2013 all things that help expand the lungs and improve the movement of air.\n\nDon't forget your mental health\n\nWhether or not you've got symptoms, getting a positive test for the coronavirus can be stressful, and isolating alone can make that even worse. When it comes to isolation, adding structure to your days can help a lot, says Dr. Frank Ghinassi, president and CEO of Rutgers University Behavioral Health Care and senior vice president at RWJBarnabas Health. Ghinassi recommends scheduling sleep and meals at the same time every day and penciling in at least one thing that provides pleasure daily \u2014 even if it's as simple as streaming a movie.\n\nThe most important part is \"actually making the schedule,\" Ghinassi says. And be sure to include some socializing \u2014 virtual socializing, that is. Also put a bit of simple exercise on the calendar if you're feeling up to it \u2014 30 minutes of light physical activity several times a week will help lift your mood. Maybe take a video exercise class or, if you're asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, climbing stairs will get your heart rate up in a good way. And if you're unwell and stairs are too much, try taking a room-to-room stroll within your home. Every little bit counts.\n\nIf your symptoms linger longer than 10 days, keep isolating\n\nUnfortunately, you can't schedule how long symptoms might last when it comes to the coronavirus. Doctors have been studying the nitty-gritty of statistics and numbers for months, and although the CDC recommends isolating at least 10 days from when mild or moderate symptoms started (or 10 days from a positive test if you never had symptoms), there's no definite number of days to isolate if you've still got symptoms after that.\n\nThe CDC says you can stop isolating if you've been free of fever without fever-reducing medicines for 24 hours and your symptoms are \"improving.\" But if you're fever-free and still feeling bad with symptoms such as cough, headache or body aches, it's best to keep staying away from people longer \u2013 at least until symptoms have continued to improve significantly for a few days.\n\nFor otherwise healthy people who test positive for the coronavirus, there's no need to retest before stopping isolation with or without symptoms. But it is important to go right back to your mask-wearing, hand-washing and social-distancing routines after that isolation period. And be sure to follow up with your primary care providers \u2013 they can help counsel you about your post-COVID-19 health needs and about becoming a part of clinical trials that can help researchers learn more about the virus and its treatment.\n\nTell your cautionary tale\n\nIf you're out of the woods after a positive coronavirus test, you might consider passing along your experience to friends and family \u2014 especially any words of cautious wisdom if you traced your own case back to a pandemic-fatigued moment of weakness, such as going to a gathering or forgoing your mask. But let's not make it a shame game: We are all human, and talking openly about your story might encourage others to keep their guard up.\n\nAnd be sure to consider sharing acts of kindness and lending a virtual ear or hand to family, friends and neighbors you hear about who test positive later on. The best treatment for all of us to give and get right now may be looking out for each other \u2013 no prescription needed.\n\nKristen Kendrick is a board-certified family physician in Washington, D.C., and a health and media fellow at NPR and Georgetown University School of Medicine.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-debate-idUSKCN24S2K0", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "title": "Notre Dame withdraws as U.S. presidential debate host, cites pandemic", "text": "FILE PHOTO: Democratic U.S. presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden holds his protective face mask as he speaks about the Trump administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic during a campaign event in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., June 30, 2020.

Can It Be Contained?", "text": "ROME\u2014The word quarantine comes from 17th-century Venetian dialect for 40 days, which was the amount of time ships had to wait in isolation before entering certain Italian ports during the pandemic known as the Black Death. Now the word is being used again in Italy, applied to the government\u2019s draconian reaction as the coronavirus and the disease known as COVID-19 appear to be hitting the country with a vengeance. More than 50,000 Italians living in 10 communities are literally locked down, facing jail sentences and fines if they leave their homes, thanks to the largest outbreak outside Asia.\n\nThe towns, all in the north of the country, are cut off from the rest of Italy now, not even the trains stop when they roll through. The church services are cancelled and dipping one\u2019s hand in holy water is strictly prohibited. Three major Serie A soccer games in the area have been postponed, and schools have all been closed for the foreseeable future. Anyone defying the restrictions faces three months in jail and a fine of around $250.\n\nBut all across the country, paranoia is spreading faster than the virus. Giorgio Armani tweeted that he will now hold his Fall 2020 show behind closed doors in Milan this week, livestreaming the runway from an empty theater. The mayor of Milan, a city of more than 1.3 million people, announced Sunday that all schools and universities will be closed for at least a week even though the city is not locked down under the current quarantine.\n\nIn Rome, nervous taxi drivers outside Fiumicino Airport were hesitant to pick up Asian passengers and a Chinese woman in Turin reported being assaulted for simply being Chinese.\n\nPrime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that all scholastic trips into and out of the country are suspended, including one involving this reporter\u2019s son who was pulled from a flight to Budapest along with 30 other students early Sunday morning.\n\nMatteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party wants to close the frontier, though countries that border Italy are likely thinking the same thing from their side. An outbreak this extensive and virulent is likely to impact all of Western Europe very quickly, if not with the disease itself, then with precautions taken to try to stop it.\n\nSince Friday, Italian authorities have confirmed more than 130 new cases, including two fatalities, in the north of the country. Three people, including two Chinese tourists, who were confirmed positive in Rome last month have since recovered and are no longer believed to be contagious.\n\nA Chinese tourist died in France earlier this month, but the deaths in Italy are the first Europeans killed by the virus. Both of the Italian victims were in their 70s. The first was a man who died in hospital, and who also suffered from other respiratory problems. The second was a woman found dead in her home on Saturday morning, clearly unaware she even had the virus. It is unknown how many people may have been in contact with her.\n\nThe quick spread of the disease in this outbreak and the uncertainty about how it came to Italy is especially troubling.\n\nIn the northern town of Codogno, near Milan, the 39 people who initially tested positive are all tied to the local hospital and a so-called \u201cPatient Zero\u201d who was thought to have brought it back from Shanghai. The problem is that \u201cPatient Zero\u201d never tested positive for the virus. Authorities think he may have been a silent carrier, infecting a friend referred to as \u201cPatient One\u201d whose only tie to China was being a friend of \u201cPatient Zero.\u201d Authorities at first thought \u201cPatient Zero\u201d had the virus and recovered, but they concede that, in fact, there may be another source. Clearly, this is not a perfect science.\n\nOn Sunday morning, the regional governor of Lombardy, Attilo Fontana, confirmed that 89 people have now tested positive for the virus and a much larger but unspecified number are referred to as suspect cases.\n\nThe second hotspot is in the Veneto region, near Venice, which is celebrating Carnevale to somewhat diminished crowds. Twelve people in the region have tested positive even though none of them has ever been to mainland China or, as far as is known at this point, been in contact with any obvious vectors. Eight Chinese residents, two of whom came back from Wuhan through via Germany, are under quarantine\u2014but they have not tested positive. It is yet unclear if that cluster will grow.\n\nOther cases in Turin and Milan confirmed Sunday morning have spread the panic even further.

How was the diet?\n\nThe process is still going on, we\u2019re entering the final stage now. The weight cut is going smooth. I thought it would be more complicated since I never went through a diet before, never did something like this. I usually just cut weight during fight week, but this time I had a diet. Man, as incredible as it sounds, I\u2019m feeling great, fast, stronger, so it\u2019s been fine. I have the support of great professionals by my side so everything will be alright.\n\nYou\u2019re fighting a Brazilian now in Marlon, an athlete you\u2019ve known for a long time\u2026\n\nExactly. We\u2019ve trained together, he trained here in the gym before going to the United States, but everyone defends its own side. He lives in America now, his family is there. It\u2019s a fight between Brazilians, but I don\u2019t see it like that. I have to defend my side, my family, my team and my country.\n\nWhat have you changed the most in terms of diet now that you\u2019re getting close to the fight?\n\nI\u2019ve been on a diet for two months and we have changed a lot already, but it hasn\u2019t been that different. We\u2019re doing another diet this week, but it\u2019s just fine for me. I\u2019m eating on the right time, eating healthy food only, and that\u2019s keeping me really strong.\n\nIs it going to be harder for you not being able to go to a steak house a week before the fight?\n\nYeah, I\u2019ve always done that, but this time I can\u2019t. Only if it were a vegan steak house, salads only. I\u2019m eating that a lot now, almost two pounds of salad a day. But I\u2019ll be able to do that the Saturday after the fight.\n\nI believe it\u2019s been eight years since Moraes moved away from Brazil. What do you recall of your training sessions with him in the past?\n\nIt\u2019s been a really long time. He\u2019s a kid with good kickboxing. I\u2019ve been following his work closely. He\u2019s very explosive, but I can\u2019t remember specific training sessions with him because it\u2019s been a long time. But I know what he does because I\u2019ve been watching his fights for a while. We already have an idea in mind.\n\nYou talked about going down in weight to face Cejudo. What made you change your mind and fight Marlon instead?\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a change of mind. If I could, I would obviously want to fight Cejudo, Max Holloway, Khabib, only the champions. Everybody wants to fight the champions. But Cejudo had surgery now and wouldn\u2019t be able to fight. I wanted to fight this year. Marlon asked for a fight and I accepted it.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned earlier this year that you wanted to fight out your contract to box. What made you change your mind about that?\n\nFirst of all, I want to fight until I\u2019m 40. I\u2019m 33 now, so I have seven more years ahead of me. I still dream about boxing, and that will happen really soon. Rest assured that it will happen. But I\u2019ll fight for some more time. This is my first fight at bantamweight until I\u2019m champion again.\n\nDo you think about going back to featherweight or challenging McGregor, Khabib\u2026\n\nNeither one of them, I don\u2019t. Khabib is a great athlete and a great champion who deserves to be there, dominant, in the lightweight division. McGregor, I don\u2019t even know if he can still fight. Someone I would really like to fight again is Max Holloway, who beat me twice. I never saw myself losing twice to someone. I dream about fighting him again one day at featherweight.\n\nYou\u2019ve always talked about not wanting to fight for much longer and now you\u2019re talking about fighting until you\u2019re 40...\n\nIt could be even more (than 40). First of all, I\u2019ve never partied and drank throughout my career, I have a healthy body. What keeps me fighting is that over the years, when I didn\u2019t want to do it anymore, I spoke with \u2018Dede\u2019 and he convinced me to do this experience at bantamweight. I had it in my mind that it would be difficult to make weight, to go on a diet, but it was the exact opposite. I\u2019m feeling strong, training super well. I haven\u2019t felt this way even when I was in the WEC. That makes me believe I have a lot more to give, and you can be sure that I will fight for many years.\n\nIn the past you\u2019ve said that you wanted to do it like Georges St-Pierre and retire in your prime, and then you talked about three more fights in Brazil and that\u2019s it, and now you\u2019re talking about seven more years. What happened that made you change plans?\n\nExactly that. \u2018Dede\u2019 asked if we would make the bantamweight limit and wondered if I could. All that suffering to make featherweight was still in my head. But we went to a nutritionist, spoke with our doctor, they made this entire preparation and I\u2019m feeling super well. If I\u2019m feeling super well, fast, stronger than ever, there\u2019s no reason to stop now. I want to win the bantamweight title and make more history, and then think what\u2019s next. But I don\u2019t think about that now. My family and \u2018Dede\u2019 can answer that question.\n\nHow much do you weigh right now?\n\n69kg (152.1lbs) on the dot.\n\n(Aljamain) Sterling complained recently about you and Frankie Edgar moving down in weight and possibly jumping the line for the title. Do you think that a win over Marlon could help you to jump the line and fight Cejudo next?\n\nFirst of all, I respect everybody. I always stay with my feet on the ground. But that\u2019s a fact. Frankie Edgar and I, and any other former champion, we have a head start. It\u2019s not about cutting the line, it\u2019s our history in the UFC that helps with opening doors in new weight classes.\n\nFighters often talk about injuries they suffer in training for being heavier, but you\u2019re much lighter now. Are you taking any extra care in the gym to avoid injuries?\n\nI think it\u2019s even better. I was talking to Leo Santos about our training sessions we used to do, when I got tired really fast because I was heavier. I think this is my ideal weight. \u2018Dede\u2019 always wanted to me to stay around this weight. It\u2019s hard to hit the bantamweight limit, of course, but I can train hard, the way \u2018Dede\u2019 asks me to, and don\u2019t get injured because I\u2019m well prepared and strong.\n\nYou talked about the weight cut and how that might affect you. You said you\u2019ve gained more in terms of performance and cardio, but has it affected your chin while sparring?\n\nNothing. No way. If you hit the chin, it can be the weakest man in the world hitting the strongest, if it lands, he will fall and go to sleep. There\u2019s no other way. But that\u2019s not a thing. If you\u2019re surrounded by good professionals, doing everything by the book, you won\u2019t feel weak. People think you\u2019ll get weak, but no. It\u2019s all about the diet and the preparation, the way you do everything. I\u2019m feeling strong, and I\u2019m absorbing strikes the same way I was before. But I\u2019m way faster now. If I hit anyone in the chin, they all go down.\n\nYou\u2019re not the type of fighter to send messages after a fight, but are you convinced that a good win over Marlon puts you in title contention next, or maybe it\u2019s a good idea to say something to Cejudo just to be sure?\n\nI\u2019m thinking about Marlon now, I can\u2019t bite off more than I can chew. First of all, I\u2019ll think about Marlon. We have to remain focused, go there and win, and then we think about Cejudo or whoever.\n\nMany people adapt well to a new weight class, but others don\u2019t. Are you curious to see how it\u2019s going to be with you?\n\nI\u2019m very curious. I\u2019m so much better physically and technically now that I\u2019m anxious to get to fight week already. I want to get to next week to see how my weight cut goes. Everybody says it will be easy because my weight is going down fast. I even had to change my diet because I was down at 67kg (147lbs), training hard, something I had trouble doing a week before the fight at featherweight. I\u2019m training way lighter now. That makes me curious, and convinces me to stay on this new phase. I\u2019m really anxious. I want to see how my final week of the weight cut will be, and the fight. I\u2019m sparring really well, like we always do, pushing all the way to the end and asking for more. I leave the mat and go to the treadmill to run more. It\u2019s crazy. I see myself as a young kid again, but with more experience.\n\nYou haven\u2019t fought any Brazilians for 10 years, and then you fought Moicano and now Marlon. Do you think that\u2019s just the new wave of Brazilians coming or the UFC testing new Brazilians and using you as a gatekeeper?\n\nI don\u2019t see me as a gatekeeper. It\u2019s part of the game. Marlon and I want the same thing, which is to become champion. He\u2019s coming off a title fight now and it will be hard for him to fight Cejudo again, if he\u2019s still there. But it could be a door for me because he\u2019s No. 1 in the ranking today. That\u2019s how I see this. I hope that Brazil has new great athletes to fight for belts and become champions in the future and keep MMA strong here.\n\nMarlon\u2019s fighting style is very similar to yours, with a lot of kicks and attacks to the legs. Have you ever fought someone with a style so similar to yours? Do you think it can be more complicated for whatever reason?\n\nI think it can be easier. Staying on the feet is better for me. I feel more comfortable. I\u2019m anxious to fight already and see how it goes because I\u2019m feeling super great.\n\nSo we shouldn\u2019t expect you to take him down, right?\n\nI could be fighting the world champion in anything, if you watch my fights in the UFC I don\u2019t take anyone down. It\u2019s MMA and there\u2019s the possibility, of course, but I don\u2019t see any problem keeping the fight on the feet.\n\nWe saw a Jose Aldo we weren\u2019t used seeing in that fight against Volkanovski\u2026\n\nThat was shit. I\u2019m sorry, that was shit.\n\nAre you hungry to show an exciting Jose Aldo again and try to erase that performance? That was a fight that could have put you close to another title fight.\n\nI\u2019ll even apologize to everyone for that shitty fight I put on. I can\u2019t do that. I prepared to fight, wanted that fight, asked the fans to be there, and then I did nothing. I fought way less than I can do. Losses and wins are part of the game, no problem with that, but I have to give my best in every fight, win or lose. I didn\u2019t do anything there. But this is a new phase for me at bantamweight and I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m feeling super well. That could have been a final moment for me, but it lit a fire again and showed me I\u2019m capable of becoming world champion again.\n\nHow do you see Volkanovski vs. Holloway going down?\n\nThey both deserve to be at the top today. I think Max has had great performances and is developing a good fighting style. He has a rubber face that absorbs strikes well. Volkanovski has grown a lot, but I see Max Holloway as the favorite. He has the size advantage and a game that I just don\u2019t see how he loses. But if that happens, no problem. It\u2019s their problem. I\u2019m thinking about the 14th, about Marlon.\n\nSix months have passed since that fight with Volkanovski. Why do you think you had such a bad performance against him that night?\n\nI was too dumb. I had knee surgery and everybody told me not to fight but I was dumb to ask for a fight. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault nor an excuse for the loss. The moment I accept a fight I have to be ready. I thought I could win, I was well-trained, I was in my city, but it was a total mistake not doing everything I trained and \u2018Dede\u2019 asked me to do.\n\nDo you regret taking that fight?\n\nI don\u2019t regret anything. You have to be a man in losses and wins. I went there and fought, no matter what happened. He was better and deserved to win, hats off to him. He had a good strategy and won. I can\u2019t cry over spilled milk. We have to move on. We can\u2019t stay in the past thinking what could have been or what could have happened. That loss was good for me because I learned so much from it. I\u2019m going through this new phase now, it changed my mind about not fighting anymore. I was disappointed in the UFC, fighting for no reason, not aiming to become champion again. That helped me, so I\u2019m glad I had that loss because it made me the new athlete I am today.\n\nDo you think that loss, being \u201cdumb,\u201d was more painful than the quick defeat to Conor?\n\nIt hurts a lot more, for sure. Conor and I, we fought and he landed a good punch. In Rio, it was about the performance. That\u2019s what bothers me. I couldn\u2019t do anything. I didn\u2019t try anything. If you lose but try something, okay. You get sad for the loss, but you tried, you fought. But that one, I\u2019m embarrassed. I can\u2019t watch that fight.\n\nDo you think you would be fighting as a bantamweight now if you hadn\u2019t lost to Volkanovski?\n\nNo. Absolutely not. That\u2019s why I say that loss came in a good moment. Sometimes it\u2019s better to take three steps back to move two steps forward. I\u2019ve learned from that. \u2018Dede\u2019 came right after that with the idea of fighting at bantamweight, a challenge that lit up the fire to compete more.\n\nTechnically speaking, how do you think you have an advantage over Marlon?\n\nNot that it favors me\u2026 Every fight I go is always 50-50, and then someone goes up and the other goes down. Each fighter has its own style and will try its best in there. There\u2019s no favorite. We\u2019ll see how things match up as the fight progresses.\n\nDo you think there will be a big difference against Marlon in terms of physique? There is no height difference, but he\u2019s a strong bantamweight. Will that be a problem for you?\n\nNo, not at all. It\u2019s hard to see a bantamweight that is stronger than me today. No doubt. There\u2019s none. One can be more adapted to the weight class in terms of cardio, but strength, no way. I feel like a horse in there. If I was strong at featherweight, imagine now at bantamweight. I\u2019m feeling great, strong, and you\u2019ll see it on the 14th.\n\nHow do you envision yourself winning? Do you envision a knockout?\n\nFirst of all, we have to have respect. I leave all the envisioning for you guys, reporters, that like to talk about this. I have to remain serious, go in there, do what I have to do and win.\n\nMcGregor just signed to fight Donald Cerrone. What are your thoughts on this fight?\n\nMan, I don\u2019t know. Whoever wins, wins. I don\u2019t see any problem. If [McGregor] fights or not, I couldn\u2019t care less. I care about myself, my team and my family.\n\nSpeaking of Cerrone, the UFC almost booked you to fight him in Sao Paulo in the past. How did you go for that, fighting at 155, to dropping to 135? What made you take that route instead of going up?\n\nIt\u2019s all \u2018Dede.\u2019 The UFC called that time and asked the fight with Cerrone for UFC Sao Paulo, but I think bantamweight would be the ideal for me. I always fought at 60kg (132lbs) in Brazil. I only went to featherweight in the UFC because they had \u2018Loro\u2019 (Galvao) there, so I moved up and did well there. But I think this is my ideal weight.\n\nDo you think the bantamweight Aldo will be better than the lightweight Aldo would have been?\n\nNo doubt. I would be smaller at 155, the horse wouldn\u2019t be so strong. They are bigger, stronger there. I would feel smaller than them.\n\nYou\u2019re focused on Marlon now but we know you\u2019re a competitive guy. Assuming it goes your way at bantamweight and you win the gold, do you think about going back to featherweight to join the champ-champ club?\n\nI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll manage to get both belts, but we\u2019ll stay focused. Beat Marlon first and become champion next, I\u2019ll be very satisfied with that. We\u2019ll go after new goals after that.\n\nCejudo posted a picture this week with two belts, asking you to bend the knee. What\u2019s your response to that?\n\nMan, Cejudo is very funny. He posts those things and sends them to me, so all I do is laugh. I think it\u2019s very funny. It\u2019s okay. Media and fans like that. It will happen more more and more.\n\nDoes that give you confidence that you\u2019re next for the belt? With all the contenders in the division, he keeps saying your name all the time.\n\nFor sure. To be remembered for my history\u2026 Not only him but Marlon as well, who asked for this fight. Everybody wants to fight the best. Him saying my name helps me a lot. Let\u2019s beat Marlon and then go to the next step.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnet.com/news/iphone-se-outclasses-all-android-phones-apples-a13-chip-processor/", "authors": ["Stephen Shankland"], "title": "iPhone SE outclasses all Android phones thanks to Apple's A13 chip", "text": "John Kim/CNET\n\nBy packing the big A13 chip into its small iPhone SE, Apple has made its budget smartphone a more compelling product at just the right time for a coronavirus-spooked world.

In his review, CNET's Patrick Holland praises the 2020 iPhone SE as a great value.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: iPhone SE reminds us how much we missed the home button\n\nThe lower-priced iPhone SE arrives as financial worries are likely steering customers away from top-end models and toward more-affordable alternatives.\n\n\"With a recession imminent ... we see some possibility of a stronger downward mix shift toward the iPhone SE,\" Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a Wednesday research note.\n\nA low-budget but modern iPhone helps Apple keep its iOS ecosystem ticking over, too, which provides a lot more money beyond the initial phone sale. With that iOS foundation, Apple is expanding its business to services like Apple TV Plus, Apple Music, Apple Arcade iCloud data sync and backup and the 30% that the company charges developers that sell apps through its App Store.\n\nA13 chip horsepower\n\nThe A13 chip -- its full name is A13 Bionic -- is the product of a gargantuan engineering effort. It's got 8.5 billion transistors, the tiny on-off switches that do everything from simple math to artificial intelligence algorithms that process voice commands.\n\nTwo main processor cores handle performance-critical tasks like playing games or scrolling through busy Facebook feeds. They're paired with four smaller, power-efficient cores for background tasks like playing music and keeping the phone running when it's mostly idle in your pocket.\n\nThe processor also has large modules for graphics and AI processing. Other dedicated modules handle photo processing, video decoding, HDR video, cryptography and judging subjects' distance from the camera. Apple can shut off entire modules or parts of them that aren't needed to extend battery life.\n\n\"We only turn on the smallest amount of logic on the chip, dramatically reducing power,\" said Sri Santhanam, Apple vice president of silicon engineering, at the iPhone 11 launch event in 2019.\n\nThe A13 won't look so advanced when successors arrive. But it's got enough horsepower to work in a design that aside from software updates likely won't be updated annually like flagship iPhones. The first iPhone SE arrived in 2016, but Apple kept selling it into 2019.\n\n\"By using its most powerful processor now, Apple ensures that it can sell the iPhone SE, unchanged, for years to come,\" Greengart said.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://celebrityinsider.org/kenya-moore-flaunts-her-jaw-dropping-curves-in-this-peachy-figure-hugging-dress-437072/", "authors": ["Ron Collins", "Nellie Smith", "Wanda Holmes"], "title": "Kenya Moore Flaunts Her Jaw-Dropping Curves In This Peachy Figure-Hugging Dress", "text": "Kenya Moore shared a new pic on her social media account and she looks amazing.

Is it too soon to get vaccinated? Experts say it depends. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nWhile the influenza virus circulates all year, cases typically ramp up in October, peak between December and February, and taper off in March, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the CDC adds, flu season can last as late as May.\n\nIt\u2019s still summer. Is it too soon to get vaccinated?\n\nExperts say it really depends. In a perfect world, you\u2019d get vaccinated between mid-September and late October, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist and professor at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get vaccinated too soon, because the protection can wear off before the flu season dies down in March,\u201d he says.\n\nDr. Amesh A. Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agrees. \u201cThere is some data to suggest that if you get a flu shot very early that, by the end of the season, it\u2019s protection may wane,\u201d he tells Yahoo Life. \u201cBut the goal is to get as many people vaccinated as possible.\u201d\n\nThe CDC currently says online that \u201cgetting vaccinated in July or August is too early\u2026September and October are good times to get vaccinated.\u201d\n\nBut, if you can only get vaccinated now, experts say there might be one benefit. \u201cSome people prefer to wait until later in the fall season \u2014 late September/early October\u2014but then they run the risk of missing it. People can get busy and forget,\u201d Dr. David Cennimo, assistant professor of infectious disease at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, tells Yahoo Life.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea to take your location into consideration too, Cennimo says. \u201cIn typical years, influenza hits the western U.S. earlier,\u201d making it unlikely that people on the east coast would be exposed to the flu in August, he says. But, for people on the west coast, it may make more sense to get vaccinated on the earlier side, he says.\n\nWhat do you need to know about getting one?\n\nOnce you decide when to get your flu vaccination, it\u2019s important to think about how you\u2019ll do it. While it varies on a company-by-company basis, many major organizations are still offering free flu shots to employees, Ari Cukier, chief operating officer at Affiliated Physicians, a flu vaccine provider for companies with more than 1,500 clients across the U.S., tells Yahoo Life.\n\nThings will be slightly different this year, though. Cukier says his company is mandating personal protective equipment (PPE) for all staff and requiring that patients wear masks. They\u2019re also doing temperature screenings and encouraging social distancing (when someone is not getting their vaccine). \u201cMany events are being set up outdoors \u2014 in a tent in parking lots \u2014 instead of the typical conference room setup,\u201d Cukier says.\n\nWhen Cukier\u2019s team does work indoors, they\u2019re putting nurses in \u201clarger-than-normal rooms\u201d and only having one nurse work in each office space to minimize contact.\n\nCukier says there\u2019s been a divide between smaller and larger companies with providing vaccines to employees. \u201cSmaller companies can\u2019t commit because they don\u2019t know when, if and how many employees will be back in the office,\u201d he says. \u201cMid and larger companies are committing to vaccine programs and planning on holding smaller events over extended periods of time. This will allow more flexibility for people who are set up remote to come into the office for a day if they want to.\u201d\n\nAs a whole, Cukier says that companies \u201care expecting higher than normal uptake for those they can get to the office. It\u2019s just a question of how or if they will get people to come to the office to get a shot.\u201d Ultimately, it\u2019s best to contact your office\u2019s human resources department to see if they plan to offer flu vaccines this year.\n\nWhen you do get vaccinated, whether it\u2019s at a pharmacy, doctor\u2019s office, or your work office, Schaffner says it\u2019s important to cover your nose and mouth. \u201cMake sure you wear your mask and that your healthcare provider is wearing a mask,\u201d he says. If you\u2019re especially nervous, he says that some areas are planning on hosting drive-through vaccinations, where you can get vaccinated in your car. (You can contact your doctor\u2019s office or local hospital for more information.)\n\nOverall, Adalja says you should feel safe getting your flu vaccine, provided you wear a mask and practice social distancing before and after your shot. \u201cPlenty of people are going out and getting groceries \u2014 getting vaccinated is not any riskier than that,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd, if you can wait a few more weeks to get your shot \u2014 without forgetting about it entirely \u2014 it might be best to do just that.\n\nFor the latest coronavirus news and updates, follow along at https://news.yahoo.com/coronavirus.

REUTERS/Leah Millis?\n\nThe following explains how the Stafford Act works and what powers a declaration would unlock.\n\nWHAT IS THE STAFFORD ACT?\n\nThe law, enacted in 1988, empowers the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist state and local governments during \u201cnatural catastrophes\u201d and coordinate the nation\u2019s response.\n\nFEMA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, controls more than $40 billion in federal funding set aside by Congress for disaster relief. FEMA could use that funding to help build medical facilities and transport patients, among other measures.\n\nOnly the president can declare a major disaster under the law.\n\n\u201cWe have very strong emergency powers under the Stafford Act,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. \u201cI have it memorized, practically, as to the powers in that act. And if I need to do something, I\u2019ll do it. I have the right to do a lot of things that people don\u2019t even know about.\u201d\n\nTrump has invoked the Stafford Act many times during his presidency, approving major disaster declarations to address flooding in the Midwest and wildfires in California, among other events.\n\nFEMA is commonly associated with natural disaster response but the agency can also address pandemics.\n\nIn 2000, former President Bill Clinton used a Stafford Act emergency declaration to pay for mosquito control efforts to address outbreaks of the West Nile virus in New Jersey and New York.\n\nDIDN\u2019T THE U.S. ALREADY DECLARE CORONAVIRUS AN EMERGENCY?\n\nA different government agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, declared the coronavirus a public health emergency in late January and has been the lead agency addressing the pandemic.\n\nHHS\u2019s declaration, made under a different law than the Stafford Act, allowed U.S. officials to impose restriction on individuals entering the country from China, among other measures.\n\nSeveral state governments have declared emergencies, allowing them to mandate containment zones like the one in New Rochelle, New York and address price-gouging.\n\nWHAT OTHER LAWS COULD TRUMP INVOKE?\n\nLast year Trump declared an emergency on the southern border to circumvent Congress and take money already designated for other programs to pay for his U.S.-Mexico border wall, which he promised to build during his 2016 campaign.\n\nThat declaration was made under the National Emergencies Act of 1976, not the Stafford Act. The law does not define \u201cemergency,\u201d giving the president broad discretion to declare one.\n\nAn emergency declaration under the National Emergencies Act unlocks sweeping presidential powers, like the ability to seize control of the internet or suspend laws, while a Stafford Act declaration deals only with FEMA.\n\nIn 2009, former President Barack Obama declared the H1N1 influenza, or \u201cswine flu,\u201d pandemic to be a national emergency under that law.\n\nObama\u2019s declaration waived some federal health insurance rules to speed treatment.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/cadbury/reports-manchester-united-star-goes-awol/660655", "authors": [], "title": "Reports: Manchester United Star Goes AWOL", "text": "Just days before their Premier League campaign gets underway, Manchester United's preparations have been disrupted after one of their players reportedly went AWOL.\n\nRead: 11 Football Stars Who Moved To The US\n\nOn Monday, United forward Romelu Lukaku was pictured training with former club Anderlecht, sparking speculation that the Belgian international's departure from Old Trafford was imminent.\n\nThe Independent has since reported that it was the Red Devils' day off and that Lukaku had been given permission to train with the Belgian side.\n\nHowever, Belgium's all-time leading goalscorer failed to report for training yesterday, and is now considered AWOL by United.\n\nClick here to find out how you can win a trip for two to watch a Premier League game live in the UK with Cadbury!\n\nThe 26-year-old reportedly refused to return to the club's Carrington training ground as he looks to force a move away from Old Trafford before the transfer window closes.\n\nLukaku was previously linked with a move to Juventus as part of a deal that would see Paulo Dybala go the other way, but the Manchester club was unable to reach an agreement with the Argentine forward.\n\nFellow Serie A side Inter Milan are now favourites to sign the former Chelsea and Everton striker, despite having seen a \u00a354 million (R983 million) offer rejected last month.\n\nRead: Reports: Juve Offer Three Players In Swap Deal For Pogba\n\nLukaku joined United from the Toffees in 2017, and has scored 42 goals in 96 appearances for the club since.\n\nShould United lower their asking price for Lukaku?

The U.S. government gave assurances that the temporary workers would be treated fairly under the Bracero Program, named for the Spanish word for \"farmhand.\" But oversight was minimal, and the program became notorious for brutal working and housing conditions, which contributed to its demise in 1964. By that point, Congress had established another pathway for temporary agricultural workers, which became the H-2A program in 1986.\n\nFor decades, the H-2A program remained relatively small. But over the past 10 years, demand for temporary farmworkers and ranch hands has taken off.\n\nIn 2011, Georgia passed a sweeping anti-immigration law requiring larger businesses to use E-Verify to vet new hires and imposing stiff fines and prison sentences for workers who used fake identification to get jobs. The law squeezed Georgia farmers, who had long depended on undocumented immigrants and domestic migrant workers to harvest blueberries, onions, peaches and other hand-picked crops.\n\nGeorgia is now a leading destination for H-2A farmworkers, along with Florida, North Carolina, California, Washington and Louisiana. Despite the president's executive order to \"Hire American,\" even Trump's own vineyard in Virginia was certified to hire 23 H-2A workers last year. Industry lobbyists are pushing Congress and the Trump administration to extend the program to new kinds of agricultural workers and to make it cheaper and easier to use.\n\nThe program's growth has spawned a cottage industry of visa agents and growers associations to help farmers navigate the complex application process. But increasingly, farmers are turning to farm labor contractors like Sanchez to supply workers. Last year, the Labor Department certified 1,900 applications for H-2A workers from contractors \u2014 more than triple the number in 2014 \u2014 giving these contractors permission to bring more than 100,000 temporary farmworkers to the U.S., according to NBC News' analysis of federal data. Many contractors are former farmworkers themselves.\n\n\"In theory, having labor contractors organize workers is actually a good thing, because the contractor specializes in finding work for crews and lets workers get more hours,\" said Philip Martin, a labor economist at the University of California, Davis. But many of them compete by providing workers at rock-bottom prices, Martin said \u2014 creating an incentive to skimp on workers' paychecks and housing, given the lack of vigorous oversight. \"The Department of Labor has not been good about throwing the bad ones out,\" he said.\n\nIn late 2017, Sanchez petitioned the Labor Department to bring 30 H-2A workers to Georgia to harvest pine straw, attesting that he had tried to recruit U.S. workers, as the program requires, but that none had applied for the jobs. He promised that the foreign laborers would be paid either $10.62 an hour \u2014 the minimum for H-2A workers in Georgia that year, based on a federal formula \u2014 or $1 per straw bale, hitting the same minimum hourly wage; they would be housed at a motel that had already passed government inspection, according to records obtained by NBC News.\n\nInstead, workers said, they stayed for a week at a motel \u2014 sharing beds, with some forced to sleep on the floor \u2014 before Sanchez moved them to the decrepit house in Blackshear.\n\nNo one was likely to check up on Sanchez: Under federal law, housing needs to pass inspection only when an employer applies to bring H-2A workers to the U.S. After workers arrive \u2014 sometimes months later \u2014 no follow-ups are required.\n\nVisiting more than a dozen H-2A sites in Georgia and North Carolina in November, NBC News found government-approved farmworker housing overrun with insects and spiders' nests, as well as cardboard covering broken windows. A dilapidated trailer in Georgia had gaping holes in the walls; feral cats had crawled into the kitchen cabinet, an H-2A worker documented in a video sent to Georgia Legal Services, an advocacy group that represents farmworkers. \"Rats are better than us,\" the worker said in the video.\n\nThe Labor Department conducts unscheduled inspections of H-2A worksites across the country, including occasional investigations of housing; the agency's Wage and Hour division can issue monetary penalties, force employers to pay back wages, bar employers from the program and refer cases for prosecution. But resources for enforcement haven't kept pace with the program's rapid expansion: Wage and Hour staff has fallen by 19 percent since 2016, according to federal records. And even when employers are prohibited from hiring more H-2A workers, which is relatively infrequent, the bans are usually only temporary \u2014 between one and three years.\n\nState oversight, too, is limited. Using federal grants, state agencies help H-2A employers comply with the program's requirements and carry out housing inspections required before workers move in. Despite the rapid growth of the H-2A program, federal funding to these state agencies hasn't increased, and some got less last year than they did three years earlier, according to records made public as part of a 2019 lawsuit against the Labor Department. Georgia's federal funding dropped by 15 percent, the state Labor Department confirmed.\n\nSome states, like North Carolina and California, also have their own standards and inspection systems for farmworker housing, and they take action against H-2A employers who break the rules. But others, including Georgia, have few additional rules and limited enforcement authority.\n\nLast year, the Trump administration acknowledged some of the \"unsafe and unsanitary\" conditions facing H-2A workers. In July 2019, the administration released a lengthy proposal that sought to improve housing standards and increase the bonds that contractors must obtain as proof that they can pay their workers.\n\nBut the administration's plan \u2014 which the Labor Department is slated to finalize next month \u2014 would also relax rules for employers who have complained that the H-2A program is too slow, expensive and cumbersome. State agencies would be allowed to conduct less frequent housing inspections by having employers certify themselves. Workers, meanwhile, would be responsible for more of their inbound travel expenses; some would be paid less under a new federal formula for calculating minimum H-2A wages, while others would be paid more.\n\nSome lawmakers are trying to push the program in a new direction. Last year, the Democratic-controlled House passed a bipartisan farm labor bill that would include a pathway to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants and H-2A workers. The bill would also add 20,000 year-round H-2A visas, which are currently unlimited but only seasonal.\n\nBut the chances that Congress will pass any kind of immigration overhaul are slim, with a pandemic gripping the country and a presidential election only months away.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to keep the door open for H-2A workers, temporarily easing visa rules by allowing employers to hire guest workers more quickly and keep them in the U.S. longer. \u201cThe Trump administration is working to keep our farmers and growers competitive while ensuring that American workers have access to more opportunities and higher wages,\u201d the White House said in a statement, adding that problems with H-2A workers\u2019 health, safety, and employment \u201ccan be identified and resolved.\u201d\n\nEven as unemployment has climbed to the highest rate since the Great Depression, industry leaders say farmers are still scrambling to find enough workers to plant and harvest their crops \u2014 tough, manual labor that is usually in remote locations.\n\nLabor advocates fear that America's faltering economy could put these guest workers at even greater risk. While demand for produce sold in grocery stores has remained high, the pandemic has dealt a major blow to many farms that supply restaurants, cafeterias and other institutions.\n\nThat has increased the pressure for growers who rely on the H-2A program to cut costs \u2014 and that could ultimately mean skimping on wages, housing and other labor expenses, said Michael Hancock, a lawyer with Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll, a civil rights and employment law firm. Hancock was a Labor Department official in President Barack Obama's administration.\n\n\"Who are the most powerless people in this process, in the weakest negotiating and bargaining position?\" Hancock said. \"The workers.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nba-draftees-dont-know-outkast-name-the-90s_n_5d0e66c7e4b07ae90d9e075b", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "title": "NBA Draftees Have No Clue Who OutKast Is: 'What Is That Group Called?'", "text": "OutKast began trending on Twitter this week, but not because the hip-hop duo is releasing a new album.

Is Mr. Ross openly condoning and outlining the incitement of a second English civil war?\n\n\"These republican petitions may seem small, and the greater population may not take notice now, but such movements are dangerous and treasonous in the eyes of The Crown and a greater portion of the British population. Such movements seek to overthrow our system of governance and operations, warning signs that the greater British population can not ignore.\n\n\"This nation is and will remain a monarchy until the people collective say otherwise, regardless of small pockets of republican extremists such as in Brighton and Hove.\n\n\"Brighton itself has a very good and especially historic relationship with The Crown, from George IV to William IV, even to Queen Victoria whom sold the Royal Pavilion to the city.

The average age a young adult moves out of the home in Spain is 29.5, compared to 18.5 in Sweden and 21.1 in Denmark, according to Eurostat.\n\n- Nursing homes -\n\nFamilies also frequently visit relatives who live in nursing homes, which became tragic focal points of the pandemic in Spain, Hernandez said.\n\nThe health ministry does not provide figures for the number of deaths from COVID-19 at nursing homes.\n\nBut the governments of the two hardest-hit regions, Madrid and Catalonia, reported a combined total of around 8,000 confirmed and suspected deaths from the disease at retirement homes.\n\nResidents of nursing homes are \"very old, very fragile,\" said Trilla.\n\n\"They are not healthcare establishments and were not prepared for this. That caused a fire of colossal proportions,\" he added.\n\n- Strained health care system -\n\nSpain's public healthcare system is ranked in the top 10 in the world by the World Health Organization (WHO), but it has suffered deep spending cuts since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.\n\nWhile it has a strong primary care network, hospitals have fewer beds than the European average, which forced them to improvise during the pandemic.\n\nLike banks with little solvency \"they did not pass the stress test,\" said Guillem Lopez-Casasnovas, an economist and expert on healthcare systems at Barcelona's Pompeu Fabra University who has worked as an advisor to the WHO.\n\n\"When you live day to day, you get the most out of what you have, but you don't have enough muscle to respond to a major stressor like now,\" he added.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/21/biden-coronavirus-relief-fight-438895", "authors": [], "title": "Biden wades into coronavirus relief fight", "text": "Biden met with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in Wilmington, Del., on Friday to discuss how to move a bill through Congress in the lame duck, inserting himself into talks that have been stalled for months. He and his top aides have publicly and privately pushed for Congress to pass another coronavirus relief package as soon as possible, warning that a failure to act will leave the virus unchecked and the economy unsupported just as the country is headed into a long winter.\n\nBiden, Pelosi and Schumer agreed such a package must include priorities such as small business aid, money for state and local governments, expanded unemployment benefits and \u201caffordable health care for millions of families,\u201d according to a readout of the meeting provided by Biden's transition team.\n\nThere is no path forward, however, without Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who appears unwilling to pass the sort of multitrillion-dollar relief package that Democrats want, particularly when it comes to providing aid to state and local governments.\n\nPeople close to the Biden transition\u2019s economics team say they are acutely aware they will have to deal with a Republican Senate if Democrats don\u2019t win two runoffs races in Georgia and may not be able to pass as big a stimulus package as they would like. Republican senators tried to pass a $500 billion package in October, and most have been loath to consider anything above $1 trillion.\n\nRepublican and Democratic congressional leadership staffers who met on Thursday could not even agree on what they were talking about: Schumer framed the discussion as the restart of Covid relief negotiations, while GOP aides said it was simply about the spending bill that Congress must pass by Dec. 11.\n\nOne potential path forward is for both parties to agree to extend some relief programs through that spending bill. Lawmakers could use the deadline as an opportunity to renew some existing programs currently set to expire at the end of the year \u2014 including expanded unemployment insurance, a national eviction moratorium and student loan forbearance \u2014 within or alongside that legislation.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the natural pressure point,\u201d one House Democratic aide said.\n\nBiden is entering negotiations that have foundered for months, with Trump\u2019s top negotiators, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, unable to reach a deal with Pelosi despite a seemingly endless series of meetings and calls.\n\nStepping into the breach now could be risky for Biden, who won\u2019t be sworn in for another two months. But Rahm Emanuel, who helped push an economic stimulus bill through Congress in the early months of the Obama administration while he was White House chief of staff, said securing a compromise in the lame duck could allow Biden to use his limited political capital to push for other priorities once he takes office.\n\n\u201cOne less thing to worry about is one less thing to worry about,\u201d Emanuel said.\n\nWaiting until after Inauguration Day might boost the chances of securing a larger deal \u2014 or at least one for which Biden could more easily take credit. But that\u2019s not Biden's focus, one person in touch with the transition team said.\n\n\u201cThey care more about governing than they care about politics on this one,\" the person said.\n\nJared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Biden during the Obama administration who remains an informal economic adviser, acknowledged this week that incoming presidents \u201ctypically want to wait until they have the reins of power in order to put their fingerprints on the policies coming out of the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in this case, you hear the president-elect saying this is something that should happen now,\u201d Bernstein said at a conference on Wednesday . \u201cAnd the reason is because the economy is at a very precarious moment.\u201d\n\nThe renewed push for a deal before Inauguration Day comes as new applications for unemployment benefits have started increasing again after weeks of steady decline, and the number of Americans who have been unemployed for more than six months is rising at its fastest rate ever. Roughly 12 million Americans are set to lose their jobless aid at the end of the year unless Congress moves to pass a deal.\n\nBiden's transition team is heavily focused on making sure the next package includes language on small business relief funds through the Paycheck Protection Program that would ensure that Black-owned businesses and others that had trouble securing loans the first time around are prioritized.\n\nBlack-owned businesses are failing at a much higher rate than white-owned businesses, and those that have survived are at significantly higher risk of failing over the next several months \u2014 in part because the loan program works through existing bank relationships that many minority-owned small and micro businesses lack. Two people close to the Biden team said it was essential that this problem be addressed.\n\nThey are also focused on securing funding for struggling state and local governments and extending enhanced unemployment benefits \u2014 although both remain deeply contentious issues between Democrats and the GOP Senate.\n\n\u201cWe may have to give something up to McConnell that we really don\u2019t want to give up to get it, but we simply have to do this,\u201d one person close to the transition said of extending jobless benefits.\n\nHotels, restaurants and other industries hit hard by the pandemic, meanwhile, have already started lobbying Biden\u2019s team after months of fruitless efforts to convince lawmakers and the Trump administration to pass a bill.\n\nA coalition of trade groups is preparing to launch a digital ad blitz after Thanksgiving targeting Biden\u2019s transition as well as Congress and the White House. The trade groups will also urge the hotel owners, restaurateurs and others who make up their membership to make calls and send emails pressing lawmakers to reach a deal.\n\nBrian Crawford, the American Hotel & Lodging Association\u2019s top lobbyist, said he hoped that, after campaigning as a unifier, Biden \u201cis going to urge Congress to seek an agreement before he\u2019s officially sworn in.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have businesses that are in the process of going bankrupt,\u201d Crawford added. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait until January or February for relief.\u201d\n\nTrade groups are pressing at the very least for Congress to authorize another round of loans through the Paycheck Protection Program, which distributed about $525 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses before shutting down in August. Nearly $134 billion that Congress coughed up to fund the loans before the program shut down remains unspent.\n\n\u201cThe president-elect is the head of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Tori Emerson Barnes, the top lobbyist for the U.S. Travel Association. \u201cHe just won the presidency.

But the reality is that scientists are working at breakneck speed to make a vaccine, even if it feels glacial to the rest of us. Five trials currently underway are working at an especially quick pace \u2014 it's possible that when we do see a vaccine for Covid-19, it will be because of one of them.\n\nChristopher Fox, the vice president of formulations at the Infectious Disease Research Institute (IDRI) tells Inverse that a traditional vaccine timeline is usually somewhere between 10 and 15 years.\n\n\"There is reason to expect that we will move faster than vaccine development has historically moved, but I think when you hear people say a timeline of 18 months, that is assuming everything goes perfectly,\" Fox explains.\n\nThere are already about 76 vaccine candidates confirmed by the World Health Organization as of April 20. More candidates are announced every day, but they all aim to do the same thing. That's to \"trick your body\" into recognize the coronavirus and destroy it, says Fox.\n\nThere are four essential ways scientists try to train the immune system to do that. Each method has different strengths and weaknesses:\n\nWeakened or inactive coronavirus vaccines: These use weakened or dead versions of a virus to train the body to recognize a pathogen.\n\nThese use weakened or dead versions of a virus to train the body to recognize a pathogen. Nucleic acid vaccines: These vaccines deliver part of the viruses' genetic material into the body. This gives your cells instructions to make parts of the virus. \u2014 then the immune system learns to fight it off.\n\nThese vaccines deliver part of the viruses' genetic material into the body. This gives your cells instructions to make parts of the virus. \u2014 then the immune system learns to fight it off. Viral vector vaccines: This approach involves hijacking another type virus, which knows how to enter a cell, and genetically engineering it to produce coronavirus' genetic material.\n\nThis approach involves hijacking another type virus, which knows how to enter a cell, and genetically engineering it to produce coronavirus' genetic material. Subunit vaccines: These vaccines teach the body to recognize a specific portion of a virus (like the spike protein on the coronavirus, which allows it to enter cells). These often require use of adjuvants, agents that can boost the vaccine's effectiveness.\n\nHere are 5 candidates that are being tested in humans right now. This list is not exhaustive, but these are in either phase I or phase II out of the three phases needed to make a vaccine.\n\nCanSino\u2019s Ad5-nCov\n\nWho is behind it: \u2013 CanSino Biologics Inc is a biotech company based in China. They're collaborating with the Academy of Military Medical Services Institute of Biotechnology (also based in China).\n\nType of vaccine: \u2013 Viral vector vaccine. This vaccine takes a common adenovirus (common viruses that cause cold-like symptoms) and hijacks it to make the coronavirus' spike protein. The adenovirus uses that protein to latch onto cells and infect them. Ultimately, this vaccine attempts to teach the body how to fight that latching off.\n\nThe timeline: \u2013 CanSino has completed a phase I clinical trial, and is currently recruiting for a phase II clinical trial that will begin \u201csoon,\u201d according to a disclosure released by the company to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It's unclear when this vaccine would be complete.\n\nThe outlook: \u2013 This vaccine candidate is progressing quickly. It moved from a phase I clinical trial to phase II in just three weeks. However, some participants who received a high dose of the vaccine in the phase I trial did subsequently experience high fevers, according to The South China Morning Post. These results were not published in a paper.\n\nHowever, this vaccine is thought to be a front-runner by experts, because the phase I trial is complete and because they're already moving on their phase II trial.\n\nModerna's mRNA-1273\n\nWho is behind it: \u2013 Moderna Inc is a biotechnology firm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company received $438 million from the federal Biomedical Advanced Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to develop a vaccine.\n\nType of vaccine: \u2013 Nucleic acid vaccine, specifically an mRNA vaccine. No vaccine of this type has ever been approved by the FDA. Still, these vaccines can be made very fast.\n\nThe timeline: \u2013 This company has promised one of the fastest vaccine development timelines.\n\nA phase I clinical trial is underway the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute with support from the NIH. It began on March 16. A larger phase I trial involving the same vaccine is also happening at Emory University. Moderna has already applied to move on to a phase II trial slated to begin in the second quarter of 2020, per a company release.\n\nThe release also states that a phase III study \u201ccould begin\u201d in fall 2020. But since there are no results from the first two phases yet, the timeline is not guaranteed.\n\nThe outlook: \u2013 Scientists at NIAID and Moderna are able to move quickly because their work is informed by past research on SARS and MERS (per the NIH\u2019s release). They are also preparing to scale up production. The company also signed an agreement with Swiss firm Lonza Group AG to produce 1 billion doses of the vaccine per year.\n\nThe US government has made a big bet on this vaccine to deliver on lofty promises, but the company has a spotty track record. They have never developed an FDA-approved vaccine.\n\nInovio's INO-4800\n\nWho is behind it:\u2013 Inovio Pharmaceuticals is a company focused on DNA-based vaccines in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania.\n\nType of vaccine: \u2013 Nucleic acid vaccine. This vaccine gives the body genetic instructions to create extra antibodies that know how to destroy the coronavirus.\n\nInovio is also working on an accompanying device called the Cellectra 3PSP, which can open pores within cells and help that genetic material slip inside. These devices are necessary to make sure these vaccines are as effective as they can be.\n\nThe timeline: \u2013 On April 6, Inovio began a phase I clinical trial on 40 volunteers. The results from that trial are expected \"by late summer,\" the company's website reads. Phase II clinical trials are expected by the fall of 2020. Assuming all goes well, the plan is to produce 1 million doses of the vaccine by the end of 2020.\n\nThe Outlook: \u2013 This vaccine is still progressing quickly, but hasn't committed to as rapid a schedule as Moderna's mRNA-1273. Still, the company is investing in producing it on a mass scale by partnering with Richter-Helm BioLogics. The concern is that working on both a vaccine and a device could slow them down.\n\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or \"The Oxford Vaccine\"\n\nWho is behind it: \u2013 This vaccine is being developed at the Jenner Institute at The University of Oxford. That makes it one of the few vaccines not being investigated by a biopharma company.\n\nType of vaccine: \u2013 Viral vector. This vaccine also sneaks in coronavirus' genetic material using the adenovirus.\n\nThe timeline: \u2013 This vaccine is already in a large, phase I clinical trial. The team has already given the vaccine to 320 people and aims to have given it to 1,102 people by the end of the first trial, according to the Jenner Institute's website. However, The New York Times reports that the group has plans to test their vaccine on more than 6,000 people by June.\n\nPending regulatory approval, and positive results, the vaccine could be available by September.\n\nThe outlook: \u2013 This vaccine has already shown positive results in rhesus macaques, who received a heavy dose of virus followed up with the Oxford vaccine at the Rocky Mountain Institute, an NIH lab in Montana.\n\nThe macaques remained healthy after 28 days, according to the New York Times. This research has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Human trials are still ongoing, but adenovirus-based vaccines are well-researched and have been trialed as potential Ebola vaccines.\n\nThe group is already working on scaling up production and has signed an agreement with AstraZeneca to manufacture the vaccine if it works. If it does come to fruition by September, it will be miles ahead of other candidates.\n\nSinovac\u2019s PiCoVacc\n\nWho is behind it: \u2013 Sinovac Biotech Ltd, is a China-based company, but they've partnered with the Berkeley, California company Dynavax to make a vaccine. Dynavax will provide an adjuvant \u2014 an agent intended to make the vaccine elicit a stronger immune response.\n\nType of vaccine: \u2013 An inactive form of SARS-CoV-2. This type of vaccine requires a lot of safety testing, but scientists have been making them for decades.\n\nThe timeline: \u2013 A clinical trial on this vaccine began in China on April 16, and will enroll 144 participants in the first phase. The plan is to enroll 744 participants in a phase II trial, conducted simultaneously. It's unclear when the company plans to have a vaccine completed.\n\nThe outlook: \u2013 A non-peer reviewed test of this vaccine in April in macaques suggests that the vaccine could offer \"complete protection\" from the virus. But results from human trials are awaited.\n\nInactive vaccines are an old-school approach, which means that we have the infrastructure to make them. These vaccines are also fragile and need to be kept in temperature-controlled storage. Thousands of shots have already been produced, just in case it works.\n\nAs long as we don't cut scientific corners, Fox says a vaccine might be coming relatively soon.\n\n\"If this much funding and political will was focused on any disease you would expect to see a lot of rapid progress,\" he says.\n\nScientists indicate that a vaccine is really the only way to return to normal life. That vaccine could come from any of these projects, from some that haven't even become public yet, or others that haven't progressed to human testing thus far. Wherever the vaccine comes from, it will prove to be a landmark achievement in more ways than one.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://deadspin.com/fans-rip-phillies-over-trade-for-black-lives-matter-hat-1846027380", "authors": [], "title": "Fans rip Phillies over trade for Black Lives Matter hater/batting practice pitcher Sam Coonrod", "text": "With an ERA over nine last season, Sam Coonrod watched a lot of guys round the bases.

The Cowboys (6-4) are 6-7 on the road since the beginning of last year, while the Patriots (9-1) are a perfect 12-0 at home over the past two seasons. This must-see game kicks off at 4:25 p.m. ET from Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. The Patriots have won the last five games in the series, including a 30-6 victory the last time they met in Dallas on Oct. 11, 2015. New England is favored by 5.5 in the latest Cowboys vs. Patriots odds, down one from where the line opened, while the over-under for total points scored is 44.5. Before making any Patriots vs. Cowboys picks of your own, listen to what the SportsLine Projection Model has to say.\n\nThe model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up over $7,000 for $100 players on its top-rated NFL picks since its inception four years ago. It has nailed its recent top-rated NFL picks, entering Week 12 of the 2019 NFL schedule on a strong 30-20 run that dates back to last season. It's also on an incredible 92-63 roll on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season, The model has also ranked in the Top 10 on NFLPickWatch the past three years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 96 percent of CBS Sports office pool players during that span. Anyone who has followed it is way up and consistently beaten NFL odds.\n\nNow, the model has set its sights on Cowboys vs. Patriots. We can tell you that the model is leaning under, and it's also generated a strong against the spread pick that is hitting in nearly 60 percent of simulations. Head to SportsLine to see it. Now, here are the betting lines and trends for Patriots vs. Cowboys:\n\nCowboys vs. Patriots spread: Patriots -5.5\n\nCowboys vs. Patriots over-under: 44.5 points\n\nCowboys vs. Patriots money line: Cowboys +200, Patriots -250\n\nDAL: 1-1 against AFC East teams\n\nNE: Outscored opponents 287-108\n\nSince 1994, New England has had 23 winning seasons, including this year, and 19 in a row. The Patriots have won 10 or more games in 17 of the past 18 seasons and are 264-90, including 30-10 in the postseason, under coach Bill Belichick. Since beginning play as the Boston Patriots in 1960, New England has made 26 postseason appearances and won six Super Bowls, including last season when they beat the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 in Super Bowl LIII.\n\nWide receiver Julian Edelman is quarterback Tom Brady's top receiving weapon with 68 receptions for 716 yards (10.5 average) and four touchdowns. He has had six 20-plus yard receiving plays. Edelman has 39 receptions for 380 yards and two touchdowns over the past five games and will be leaned on heavily on Sunday with fellow wide receivers Phillip Dorsett (concussion) and Mohamed Sanu (ankle) both questionable.\n\nBut just because New England is perfect at home does not guarantee it will cover the Patriots vs. Cowboys spread on Sunday.\n\nThat's because Dallas has won three of its last four games and taking aim at a fourth straight winning season and fifth out of the past six years. The Cowboys are also 6-1 against the spread in their last seven games in November. Quarterback Dak Prescott has been prolific this season, completing 247-of-365 passes for 3,221 yards, an average of 322.1 per game, with 21 touchdowns and a 104.1 passer rating.\n\nSo who wins Cowboys vs. Patriots?

If we could survive that, we can survive this,\" he said.\n\nBurr went on to say that he's been at home with his wife and three-year-old. \"I'm immature as hell. It's not good for my wife because now she has two kids at home,\" he explained. He also said he has been helpful with chores because he's aware that he's a lot to deal with: \"I understand the plight of my life being married to me, so I really go out of my way to do all the little things to make up for the big thing that is me.\"\n\nThe two later chatted about the NFL, grocery shopping and more.

James Lankford said Wednesday that he will intervene if the Trump administration has not allowed President-elect Joe Biden access to presidential daily intelligence briefings by the end of the week, one of the first rights of a presidential candidate after winning the election.\"There is no loss from him getting the briefings and to be able to do that,\" Lankford told radio station KRMG, noting that he sits on the Senate Oversight Committee and that he's already started engaging on this issue.The Oklahoma Republican said if no progress is made on the issue by Friday, he will step in and say, \"This needs to occur so that regardless of the outcome of the election, whichever way that it goes, people can be ready for that actual task.\"Lankford's comment comes as Biden and his senior advisers are not yet receiving the President's Daily Brief, the highly classified intelligence briefings about pressing national security issues that their soon-to-be predecessor has been offered daily.The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that Biden's lack of access stems from the election being not yet ascertained by the General Services Administration \u2014 a clear indication that the Biden transition team is not getting the same briefings that presidents-elect typically receive.It remains unclear whether the race needs to be ascertained before the president-elect can legally receive the briefings. Biden has said that the daily briefings \"would be useful, but it's not necessary.\"Lankford on Wednesday also referenced the abbreviated 2000 transition, which a bipartisan 9/11 report said contributed to a lack of security preparedness ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks.\"There's nothing wrong with Vice President Biden getting the briefings to be able to prepare himself and so that he can be ready \u2014 the president's already getting those,\" Lankford said, adding that Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator from California, also has the appropriate clearances to begin receiving briefings because she serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee.Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also called for Biden to receive the briefings.\"As has been done in every other transition, the president should order that Biden and his team receive the PDB, as has been done in the past, even during the contested election of 2000,\" Warner said Wednesday. \"It's simply irresponsible to withhold this in these uncertain times.\"Like most of his Republican colleagues, Lankford did not go so far as to acknowledge that Biden is the president-elect after every major news organization projected his victory on Saturday.Lankford defended the president's many legal disputes, saying the best thing right now is for Trump to be able to go through the legal process and \"get real answers\" before the Electoral College casts ballots in December.There is no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud in this election.In the meantime, Lankford said, \"Joe Biden can continue to be able to function and say, 'I'm the president-elect,' and great if you want to say that, go do it, and to be able to do your preparation work. The president can say, 'Not so fast. I've got questions to answer.' Great, go ask them.\"Lankford implied that if the president is not able to follow through with legal proceedings, it might stoke conspiracies among Trump supporters.But judges have quickly dismissed cases that attempt to raise the possibility of voting irregularities, while elections experts make clear Biden's margin of victory is too wide for court cases to reverse and that existing court cases deal with too few votes, if any, to matter.Asked about concerns at the Pentagon after Defense Secretary Mark Esper's firing on Monday and other moves by the administration that put a peaceful transfer of power into question, Lankford replied, \"I can assure you, there will be a peaceful transition of power in the United States.\"Lankford downplayed the significance of Esper's firing within days of the election, saying it was \"obviously long-planned\" and not just from a \"single petty event from months ago.\"He said, though, that he personally would not have made that change \"with the next two months\" \u2014 seeming to refer to the two-month period until the inauguration \u2014 again without fully acknowledging Biden as president-elect.\"It was a clear signal with preparation behind the scenes for a good transition at the Pentagon,\" Lankford said.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower/more-witnesses-to-testify-as-us-house-prepares-impeachment-rules-idUSKBN1X91LZ", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "title": "Trump impeachment inquiry hears more evidence of outside efforts to influence Ukraine policy", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Further evidence of private interests seeking the ouster of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch emerged on Wednesday in testimony to a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct toward that country.\n\nCatherine Croft, a Ukraine specialist at the State Department, said Robert Livingston, a former Republican congressman-turned-lobbyist, repeatedly urged that Yovanovitch be fired.\n\nIt was unclear why, she said in her opening statement to lawmakers, posted online by the Washington Post.\n\nTrump removed Yovanovitch in May at the urging of his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November 2020 U.S. election. Allies of the president had leveled unsubstantiated charges of disloyalty against Yovanovitch.\n\nLivingston is another well-connected Republican who, along with Giuliani, advocated against Yovanovitch.

Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the inquiry a sham.\n\nCroft, who testified for roughly five hours on Wednesday, was a member of the National Security Council staff at the White House from July 2017 to July 2018.\n\nShe said Livingston characterized Yovanovitch as an \u2018Obama holdover\u2019 who was associated with liberal activist George Soros.\n\nSoros is a wealthy financier often assailed by conservatives and known for his support of liberal causes. Barack Obama was Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor.\n\n\u201cIt was not clear to me at the time - or now - at whose direction or at whose expense Mr. Livingston was seeking the removal of Ambassador Yovanovitch,\u201d Croft said.\n\nGiuliani has admitted sending to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a packet of information in March including a document describing a discredited theory promoted by Trump allies that Yovanovitch was installed in her post in Kiev by Soros and that unless she was removed, Soros \u201chas as much, or more power over Yovanovitch as the president and the Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nAs a congressman, Livingston played a prominent role in the Republican-led drive to impeach Democratic President Bill Clinton for lying about his relationship with an intern before quitting in 1998 when it emerged he had engaged in an extramarital affair.\n\nLobbying disclosure filings with the Justice Department showed Livingston\u2019s firm represented two Ukrainian clients in Washington.

It\u2019s a lesson for the #MeToo era.", "text": "Joichi Ito, the director of MIT\u2019s Media Lab, resigned from his post on Saturday after new reporting showed he took donations from sex offender Jeffrey Epstein \u2014 and worked to conceal their source \u2014 years after Epstein was first indicted on sex crime charges.\n\nIto acknowledged earlier this month that he accepted donations from Epstein both for the lab \u2014 which describes itself as an \u201cantidisciplinary research community\u201d that \u201cexamines the deeper implications of where technology creation and adoption has led us\u201d \u2014 and for his own investment funds. And on Friday, Ronan Farrow of the New Yorker reported that the Media Lab had also accepted at least $7.5 million from other wealthy donors \u201cdirected\u201d or facilitated by Epstein. Ito also took pains to conceal his work with Epstein, insisting that donations be recorded without his name and noting the money manager\u2019s visits on his calendar only with the initials \u201cJ.E.,\u201d Farrow reports.\n\nIto also resigned this weekend from the boards of the the MacArthur Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, and the New York Times Company, and from a visiting professorship at Harvard, the New York Times reports.\n\nThe revelations about Epstein\u2019s donations \u2014 and the way he apparently used his relationships with scientists to launder his public image \u2014 raise new questions about sexual assault cases and their aftermath. In the current phase of the #MeToo movement, a lot of attention has focused on what happens to men accused of sexual misconduct \u2014 their investigation, their punishment, and, in some cases, their eventual redemption.\n\nBut the story of Ito and the MIT Media Lab is a reminder that many powerful men accused of sexual abuse or other misconduct were also surrounded by people who looked the other way \u2014 or who helped them build and rebuild their empires in full knowledge of the allegations against them. To be complete, the reckoning around sexual misconduct ushered in by #MeToo will need to address these networks of enablers as well as the perpetrators themselves.\n\nIto knew Epstein was a sex offender. He took his money anyway.\n\nSince Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail in August, attention has shifted to his friends, alleged co-conspirators, and associates. The money manager was a longtime patron of academia and the sciences, who was known for hosting dinner parties for scientists and other luminaries (at some of these he apparently discussed his plans for a \u201cbaby ranch\u201d where he would seed the human race with his DNA). He also donated to several academic programs, including the MIT Media Lab.\n\nFounded in 1985, the lab has been described by its leaders as a place for outside-the-box thinking; Ito once called it a place for \u201cpeople who don\u2019t fit in any existing discipline either because they are between \u2014 or simply beyond \u2014 disciplines.\u201d But it also became a vehicle for MIT to cozy up to private business and wealthy donors, Justin Peters writes at Slate.\n\nThe extent of Epstein\u2019s links with the Media Lab has become clear over the last few weeks. In August, Ethan Zuckerman, a media professor at MIT, announced he was severing ties with the lab after learning of Epstein\u2019s ties to Ito. Another researcher soon followed suit. Last week, Ito admitted publicly that Epstein had donated $525,000 to the lab, as well as giving $1.2 million to investment funds that Ito controlled.\n\nThen, on Friday, Farrow reported at the New Yorker that Epstein\u2019s influence at the Media Lab went beyond those donations. Epstein also helped the lab get $7.5 million in donations from other wealthy people, including Bill Gates \u2014 emails describe the donations as having been \u201cdirected\u201d by Epstein, according to Farrow.\n\nAll this happened after Epstein was sentenced to jail in 2008 and forced to register as a sex offender, and emails between Ito and others show that Ito was aware of Epstein\u2019s past and worked to conceal his relationship with the lab, Farrow notes. In one email exchange, Ito solicited money from Epstein for a researcher\u2019s work, asking, \u201cCould you re-up/top-off with another $100K so we can extend his contract another year?\u201d\n\nEpstein agreed, and Ito forwarded the exchange to a staffer with the note, \u201cMake sure this gets accounted for as anonymous.\u201d Ito also identified Epstein on his meeting calendar only as \u201cJ.E.,\u201d though other guests were identified by their full names, Farrow reports. Ito did not comment to the New Yorker for the story.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing part of Farrow\u2019s story are the recollections of Signe Swenson, a former lab staffer who says that Ito had told an associate that Epstein \u201cnever goes into any room without his two female \u2018assistants,\u2019\u201d and that he wanted to bring the \u201cassistants\u201d into a Media Lab meeting. The women \u201cwere models. Eastern European, definitely,\u201d Swenson said. She added that she and other female staffers were concerned for them \u2014 \u201cwe literally had a conversation about how, on the off chance that they\u2019re not there by choice, we could maybe help them.\u201d\n\nSwenson resigned in 2016, in part over concerns about Epstein, and began working with a law firm on telling her story publicly. Ito, Farrow notes, continued downplaying his connections with Epstein up until his resignation on Saturday. In an August statement admitting his knowledge of \u201cgifts\u201d from Epstein, Ito said, \u201cRegrettably, over the years, the Lab has received money through some of the foundations that he controlled.\u201d\n\nIto and others helped Epstein rehabilitate his image\n\nBy accepting Epstein\u2019s donations, Ito and others weren\u2019t just taking the money of a sex offender. They were also helping him rebuild his public image and potentially commit more crimes. After his jail term, Epstein put up a website trumpeting a gathering he\u2019d hosted that was attended by Stephen Hawking and other scientists, the New York Times reported. Such websites allowed Epstein to rehabilitate his reputation, including the Google search results for his name. \u201cIf you looked up Jeffrey Epstein online in 2012, you would see what we all saw,\u201d Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College, told the Times, explaining why Bard accepted donations from Epstein.\n\nEpstein also used his donations to universities to pitch positive media coverage for himself after his release from jail, and succeeded in getting HuffPost to publish a 2017 piece praising him for \u201ctaking action to help a number of scientists thrive during the \u2018Trump Era,\u2019\u201d according to the Times (the piece has since been taken down).\n\nIto has now resigned from his positions, but the sheer number of his resignations is a reminder that those who worked with or took money from Epstein had (and in some cases, still have) a variety of positions of power in American society. In Ito\u2019s case and in others, they knew that Epstein was a registered sex offender who had been to jail \u2014 the crime for which he ultimately served time, soliciting a minor for prostitution, was public, as were allegations that he abused many more underage girls.\n\nBut some chose to take money from him anyway, effectively helping him retain his connections and social status and avoid scrutiny, even as he allegedly continued to abuse women and girls. According to lawsuits filed against his estate, Epstein was still recruiting girls and women at dance studios in New York, and abusing them, well after his jail sentence, the New York Times reports.\n\nIn the wake of Epstein\u2019s death, as authorities investigate his potential co-conspirators, it\u2019s equally important to look at the judgment of those who helped him burnish his public image by presenting himself as a friend of science and innovation. In cases where they are still in a position to make decisions about wealthy and influential donors, it\u2019s worth asking what they knew and when they knew it, and whether they would be likely to make the same decision again.\n\nEpstein appears to have been particularly adept at \u201ccollecting\u201d famous friends, but he is not the only powerful man accused of sexual abuse who was enabled, in part, by the willingness of others to keep him in power. Harvey Weinstein, for instance, was surrounded by everyone from lawyers who attacked his accusers to politicians who took his money, even though his behavior had been an open secret in Hollywood for years.\n\nIn many cases, those are people with power themselves, whose decisions affect the lives and livelihoods of many people. A true reckoning with the problems of assault and harassment has to include an examination of their role \u2014 otherwise, they might simply repeat it.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-gerrymandering/electoral-map-bias-may-worsen-as-us-gerrymandering-battle-shifts-to-states-idUSKCN1TU0G0", "authors": ["Joseph Ax", "Min Read"], "title": "Electoral map bias may worsen as U.S. gerrymandering battle shifts to states", "text": "(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that federal judges have no power to police partisan gerrymandering - the practice of manipulating electoral district boundaries for political gain - likely will embolden politicians to pursue more extreme efforts free from the fear of judicial interference, experts said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A girls colors an electoral map of the United States in either red or blue in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S. November 8, 2016. REUTERS/Jonathan Drake/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see more states doing more bad stuff,\u201d said University of California at Irvine election law expert Rick Hasen.\n\nThe court\u2019s 5-4 decision on Thursday, powered by its conservative majority in a ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, to close federal courthouse doors to partisan gerrymandering legal challenges shifts the focus of countering electoral map bias to the states.\n\nElection reformers now face a limited menu of options, all of which face potential obstacles: voter ballot initiatives, lawsuits filed in state courts and congressional legislation.\n\n\u201cThe hope from the reform groups was that you would just be able to wave a wand over the entire country and fix all the gerrymanders,\u201d said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida expert on U.S. elections. \u201cRoberts said the battle that was in the states will stay in the states.\u201d\n\nThe geographical boundaries of U.S. House of Representatives and state legislative districts across the country are redrawn to reflect population changes measured by the census conducted by the federal government each decade. The next census is in 2020. In most states, redistricting is done by the party in power.\n\nGerrymandering is carried out by configuring districts in a way that packs as many like-minded voters as possible into a small number of districts and distributing the rest in other districts too thinly to form a majority.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have been the primary beneficiaries of gerrymandering since the last round of redistricting following the 2010 census, though Democrats have engaged in the practice as well. Hasen said he expects more Democratic-led legislatures to engage in the practice in light of the ruling.\n\n\u201cI think there will be a lot of pressure on Democrats who may have held back to do so, because this has national implications,\u201d Hasen said.\n\nThe court ruled in cases from North Carolina and Maryland. In addition to ensuring that voters from those states will cast ballots in the 2020 election under the same electoral maps that were challenged, Thursday\u2019s ruling also hurts plaintiffs in Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin who have sued in federal courts, saying their voting power had been curtailed by gerrymandering.\n\nIn the longer run, countering gerrymandering will fall back to state legislatures, courts and voters themselves. Outside groups are drawing battle lines.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to fight against map manipulation using every tool that is at our disposal,\u201d said former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, whose National Democratic Redistricting Committee is backed by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican. \u201cBut even without no federal guardrail on gerrymandering, this fight is far from over.\u201d\n\nThe National Republican Redistricting Trust said it would oppose any effort to take away legislators\u2019 authority.\n\n\u201cThis is not the end of our fight,\u201d former Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker, the group\u2019s fundraising chairman, said in a statement. \u201cThe battle to protect our country from Barack Obama and Eric Holder\u2019s plan to hijack our elections now moves to the states.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, voters in several states, including Colorado and Michigan, have approved ballot measures creating independent commissions to handle the post-census process of redrawing electoral districts. About a quarter of U.S. states have given a commission either full or partial authority in redistricting.\n\nEfforts already are underway in several states, including Arkansas, Nebraska and Oklahoma, to launch similar ballot initiatives next year.\n\nElection law expert Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a University of Chicago law professor, said only about half of states allow ballot initiatives.\n\nReformers also could file challenges to gerrymandered maps in state courts, whose authority under state law is unaffected by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA BATTLE\n\nNext month, a North Carolina court will hold a trial in a case brought by advocates who claim Republican-drawn districts violate the state constitution, a dispute likely to be resolved by the state\u2019s top court. Nine of the state\u2019s 13 U.S. House seats are currently held by Republicans, even though Democrats lost the total statewide vote last year by only 2%. A new election has been called for one seat because of election fraud.\n\nLegal experts have said the state\u2019s high court, which has six Democrats among its seven justices, could follow in the footsteps of Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court, which in 2018 threw out a Republican-created map and commissioned an independent expert to draw new lines. Democrats there won half of the state\u2019s 18 House seats in 2018, after holding only five seats under the old map.\n\nMany state constitutions include language on fair elections or free speech that goes beyond the U.S. Constitution, potentially opening a legal path for gerrymandering opponents.\n\nMeanwhile, many states with severely gerrymandered districts have legislatures and courts dominated by the same party, making it unlikely that judges would take action. In Texas, Wisconsin and Florida, Republicans dominate both the legislature and the top courts, while Democrats do the same in Illinois.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no hope for reform in some of the states with the worst gerrymandering,\u201d Stephanopoulos said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A worker holds stickers for voters at a polling station at the Princeton Baptist Church during the U.S. presidential election, in Princeton, North Carolina, U.S. November 8, 2016. REUTERS/Chris Keane/File Photo\n\nA solution in the U.S. Congress appears unlikely.

Plus, some free agents who will make more than you expect, Mike McCoy thinks Philip Rivers has more in him and a critical stretch for CBA negotiations.\n\nJasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports (Tagovailoa); Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports (Anderson); Robert Hanashiro-USA TODAY Sports (Rivers)\n\nThe start of this story, you\u2019ve heard before.\n\nNick Saban had this freshman quarterback that he knew he might need at some point. So here and there, in 2017, he\u2019d try and get him extended playing time\u2014against Fresno State and Vandy, and then for the whole second half against Tennessee, even after this 19-year-old\u2019s first possession ended in a pick-six. Then, in the team\u2019s regular season finale, Auburn held the Tide to 112 yards passing and out of the end zone for the game\u2019s final 27 minutes.\n\nAlabama lost its place in the SEC title game. Saban made a decision.\n\n\u201cThe thought after that game in my mind was, \u2018If this is an issue for us moving forward, there may be a time when we have to put him in, so we can take advantage of some of the skill players we have,\u2019\u201d Saban says now. \u201cSo we go into the Georgia game, the national championship game, with the idea, \u2018Hey, these guys have a really good run defense, they\u2019ve got really good players, it\u2019s gonna be hard for us to not throw the ball effectively and win.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe idea was prescient. Georgia went up 13\u20130 at the half, holding starter Jalen Hurts to 21 yards on 3-of-8 passing. Bama needed a spark. And Saban thought to himself, This is the situation when you said you\u2019d put the other guy in and give him a chance.\n\nThe other guy went in and the rest is history.\n\nTua Tagovailoa wasn\u2019t perfect the rest of the way. He threw a pick to DeAndre Baker on a call that, per Saban, wasn\u2019t even supposed to be a pass play. Then, there\u2019s the sack he took in overtime, losing 16 yards on the Tide\u2019s first offensive snap of the extra period, prompting Kirk Herbstreit to say on the broadcast, \u201cThrow it away, nobody\u2019s open, you gotta give up on the play.\u201d But as we know now, all of that was just a set-up to what was coming.\n\nOn second-and-26, Tagovailoa uncorked a moonshot to fellow freshman Devonta Smith, streaking down the sideline for a 41-yard touchdown. Saban won his sixth national title, and fifth in Tuscaloosa. The young Hawaiian was etched in Tide lore forever.\n\nNow, for the part you don\u2019t know.\n\nSaban found Tagovailoa in the locker room postgame and, in a quiet moment, approached him in a way only this particular coach could.\n\n\u201cTua, man, you can never take a sack in overtime. Especially when it\u2019s a three-point game\u2014the game is already tied,\u201d Saban said to his quarterback. \u201cBut when we get sacked, we\u2019re out of field goal range. I don\u2019t know what you were thinking about. But you can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, coach,\u201d Tagovailoa responded, \u201cwe just needed more room to throw the ball.\u201d\n\nSaban laughs now, \u201cJust to show you what kind of personality he has, and how he\u2019s affected by the game, or the way you said it, the size of the game, the impact, the consequences.\u201d\n\nThe point in Saban telling the story\u201425 months later, with Tagovailoa\u2019s collegiate journey having become much more complicated in the interim\u2014isn\u2019t hard to figure out. One, it shows how Tua changed Alabama\u2019s program as much as any single player has in Saban\u2019s 13 years there. Two, it shows how his star has been ready for what\u2019s next for quite some time.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe, but we\u2019re now just one week from the combine. And so we\u2019re in the last real lull between now and the draft. This week, we\u2019ll cover\u2026\n\nFree agents who\u2019ll get paid more than you might expect\n\nWhy I think Philip Rivers might have something left\n\nA CBA update\n\nHow Nick Caserio wound up staying in New England\n\nWhy Eric Bieniemy wouldn\u2019t be nuts to consider Colorado\n\nLots of fun stuff in the All-32\n\nBut we\u2019re starting with the complex case of Tagovailoa, and why his college coach still sees an elite player and person, worth rolling the dice on.\n\n***\n\nBy now, you know the end of Tagovailoa\u2019s Alabama story isn\u2019t nearly as happy as storybook beginning two years ago in Atlanta. That\u2019d be Tua\u2019s only national title at Bama, and the two seasons to follow would alternate from on-field brilliance to bad medical luck and back around again. He had two ankle surgeries over his last 13 months in the program, and that was just the prelude to something much worse.\n\nOn Nov. 16, with three minutes left in the first half against Mississippi State, Tagovailoa rolled left and, as he threw the ball away, was yanked to the ground. He stayed down. The cart came out. Screams of pain were audible on the sideline as doctors popped his dislocated hip back into place. The damage was done. He suffered the hip injury, a fracture of the posterior wall, and was at risk for AVN. That\u2019s the condition\u2014which leads to the death of bone tissue due to the interruption of blood supply\u2014that ended Bo Jackson\u2019s football career.\n\nDire enough was the situation that Tua was taken by helicopter from rural Mississippi to a hospital in Birmingham. Two days later, he had season-ending surgery in Houston.\n\n\u201cIt was probably one of the most difficult things for me ever as a coach,\u201d Saban said. \u201cYou never like to see anybody get hurt, first of all. I know it\u2019s a part of the game, but as hard as these guys work, the goals and aspirations they have, you hate to ever see anybody get hurt. But a guy of his caliber, the future that the injury could impact in some way, the impact that it has on future, our team. It was really, really difficult.\u201d\n\nSaban then paused, and repeated himself, \u201cReally difficult for me as a coach.\u201d\n\nThe Tide wound up falling to Auburn two weeks later, effectively ending any shot Bama had of a sixth consecutive playoff berth. And thus, a lot of eyes were trained on Tagovailoa\u2019s next move. He had to decide whether he\u2019d stay for his senior year or declare for the draft, despite an injury that would shelve him for, at best, the great majority of the pre-draft process and rob him of a real shot to prove to teams he\u2019d be OK coming back.\n\nThe decision was agonizing, as Tagovailoa said himself. And on a lot of days, Saban, for good reason, prepared himself to talk to a depressed kid. That wasn\u2019t what he got.\n\n\u201cI would call him every day when he first got hurt. I\u2019d called him that Saturday night, and I was down and out about him getting hurt. And he would be positive and upbeat,\u201d Saban said. \u201cI was calling him to lift his spirits, and he would lift mine. And I\u2019d call him the next day, and say, \u2018I\u2019m gonna lift Tua, support him in every way.\u2019 Again, calling him to lift his spirits and he would lift mine. All through that process, he was so positive.\n\n\u201cHe just had a great outlook about the whole thing and was just looking forward to what he had to do to try to get better. He wanted to go to the games and support his teammates. He did more to help me through it than I helped him. And it was my job to help him.\u201d\n\nSaban\u2019s not a doctor, and he wasn\u2019t going to get into the specifics of the injury. I\u2019m not either. All anyone knows at this point is that, thus far, Tagovailoa\u2019s checked all the boxes he\u2019s needed to check, roughly two months out from surgery.\n\nThere\u2019s also some not-so-great history here among prior first-round quarterbacks. Every situation is different, but almost uniformly, the guys who\u2019ve come into the league with serious injury histories this decade (Sam Bradford, Jake Locker, Robert Griffin III, Marcus Mariota, Carson Wentz and Deshaun Watson) have gotten hurt again in the pros.\n\nSo here\u2019s what Saban does know: The guys he\u2019s had in the past who have overcome injuries and gone on to long and prosperous NFL careers have had similar makeup to Tagovailoa. And he knows specifically about Tua\u2019s because he saw him come back from the two ankle surgeries.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very positive person,\u201d Saban said. \u201cI think when it comes to injuries, guys that have a real positive attitude about it, look at their rehab as a positive thing, they always seem to bounce back and do better physically and emotionally than guys who get down and out about it, get depressed about it and think about what they\u2019re missing, rather than what they need to do to get back\u2014worried they\u2019re not gonna be the same as they were before.\n\n\u201cHe was always really positive about whatever he had to do to approach getting back and being able to go back out and play and compete and help his team.\u201d\n\nAnd some team will gamble that Tagovailoa can do it again, because he was good enough as a player at Bama to justify it.\n\n***\n\nSaban won five national titles, four at Alabama, before Tagovailoa arrived in early 2017. As such, it\u2019d be hard for any player to be considered a program-changer\u2014but that\u2019s what the coach soon found out he\u2019d be getting in the product of Honolulu prep powerhouse St. Louis.\n\nThe teenage quarterback arrived with a trio of future NFL receivers\u2014Jerry Jeudy, Henry Ruggs and Devonta Smith\u2014joining a roster that already had 2018 first-round pick Calvin Ridley on it. Saban had started the move from his old pro-style offense to a spread three years earlier. And it didn\u2019t take long for Saban and his new OC, Brian Daboll, to recognize they were getting the triggerman and the burners to supercharge it.\n\n\u201cFootball\u2019s a great team game, except for one position, and that\u2019s quarterback,\u201d Saban said. \u201cThat guy can impact the game more than anyone else. We won a lot of games here where we had really good quarterbacks, but never a really dynamic guy you build things around and change what you\u2019re doing to accommodate his skill set. And it really accommodated the other players that we had because we had such good skill players at wide receiver.\n\n\u201cWe changed the culture a little bit, to be a little bit more wide open, because that\u2019s what our players on offense could do. He certainly was capable of making it work\u2014and he did.\u201d\n\nThe production speaks for itself. Tagovailoa threw 25 touchdown passes before throwing his first pick of 2018. He tossed 26 touchdown passes before his first pick of 2019. He was a Heisman finalist as a sophomore and was neck-and-neck with Joe Burrow for the award going into November of this year. He had the injuries, sure. But he kept winning (23\u20132 as a starter) and kept showing exactly what you\u2019d want an NFL quarterback to show.\n\nThrough Saban\u2019s eyes, all of that went well beyond the field, and into a dynamic personality that paired nicely with his playing ability. \u201cHe\u2019s so well-liked by not just his teammates and the people internally in this program, but I think externally. Fans love him, everybody loves him. He\u2019s just that kind of kid.\u201d And that wound up rubbing off on everyone.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s not a selfish guy, none of our players on offense were,\u201d Saban said. \u201cWe had four really good receivers. They all rooted for each other, he rooted for all of them. They all made plays. None of them ever looked over their shoulder and said, \u2018Why aren\u2019t I getting more balls?\u2019 And I think that probably started with him being such a positive guy that was team-first, that they all followed the same lead.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s paid off for everyone. Jeudy\u2019s a sure-fire first-rounder going into next week\u2019s scouting combine, Ruggs might sneak into Round 1, too, and Smith went back to Bama and will be one of the best receivers in America, along with the fourth guy Saban referenced, rising junior Jaylen Waddle.\n\nTagovailoa\u2019s wait won\u2019t be long either.\n\n***\n\nAs a player, physically, there\u2019s not a whole lot about Tagovailoa that jumps out. He stands 6-feet tall and his arm is good but not great. Everything else made him different than any quarterback Saban\u2019s ever had.\n\n\u201cReally can rid of the ball quickly, and his accuracy is unbelievable, which, to me, is the most compelling thing a quarterback can have,\u201d Saban said. \u201cIt\u2019s good judgment about where you throw the ball, get it out of your hand when you need to get it out of your hand, and be accurate with it so the people that are catching it can catch it and run with it. That\u2019s what he is. He makes a lot of really, really good throws in tight windows, which is the biggest difference between college quarterbacks and pro quarterbacks.\n\n\u201cPro quarterbacks have to do that because there\u2019s a lot more man-to-man. I think he\u2019s proven that he can do that in his college career here.\u201d\n\nThen, I presented Saban with what I\u2019ve heard: That scouts who\u2019d gone through Tuscaloosa the last few years were getting Drew Brees as a comp from guys on Saban\u2019s staff.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a lot like Drew Brees. I always thought Aaron Rodgers was a lot like that as a player too,\u201d said Saban. \u201cNot overly big, accurate with the ball, really good judgment, decision-making. Those guys are the style of player. I would never say the expectation should be he would accomplish what those guys have, I\u2019d never wanna put that on a guy. But that\u2019s the style of player he is.\u201d\n\nWhich explains a lot.\n\nIt explains why Saban was comfortable putting a 19-year-old kid in that spot against Georgia in the national championship game in January 2018. It explains why Saban went with Tagovailoa the following season, and why he\u2019s still seen as such a viable NFL commodity, even after all the injuries.\n\nAnd there\u2019s still room for growth there, too, something that was proven out back during that freshman year of 2017. Earlier that season, months before his big-stage heroics, Saban and Daboll saw a quarterback who was letting mistakes compound themselves in practice. He was a perfectionist, and he\u2019d get down on himself when things went wrong.\n\nPer Saban, they\u2019d tell him, You can\u2019t do this, man. You gotta be able to overcome adversity, bounce back. Everybody has bad plays, the best thing you can do is learn from your mistakes.\n\nThe proof they got through to him? Instead of letting the 16-yard sack in Atlanta turn into another bad play, it led to a championship\u2014because he had more room to sling it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty simple, this-is-the-play, this-is-my-read, this-is-what-I\u2019m-supposed-to-do kind of guy,\u201d Saban said. \u201cHe\u2019s not thinking about winning a championship, he\u2019s thinking about, \u2018What do I have to do to give us a chance to win a championship?\u2019 He stays pretty much focused on that.\u2026 He\u2019s not one of these guys that gets overwhelmed with things.\u201d\n\nConsidering the circumstances in front of him now, that\u2019s a pretty good trait to have. And good reason to think, with an uncertain situation ahead, he\u2019ll ready for whatever\u2019s next.\n\n***\n\nFREE AGENTS READY TO CASH IN\n\nEvery year there are a few free agents off the radar who wind up making headlines: That guy got what?!? So to get you ready for what\u2019s ahead in free agency, since we sort of exhausted the quarterback topic in the Mailbag and GamePlan last week, I figured I\u2019d give you a list of guys who teams expect to get rich\u2014even if you might not expect it.\n\nRobby Anderson, WR, Jets: He\u2019s still just 26, and went for 779 yards and five touchdowns on 52 catches last year, despite the team, and its quarterback situation, being uneven early in the season. Anderson\u2019s red flags are well-documented, but he\u2019s got size, and he can run, and so someone will roll the dice on the belief they can unlock the world of talent that\u2019s here.\n\nDe\u2019Vondre Campbell, LB, Falcons: The 26-year-old was an integral part of a Super Bowl defense in 2016, playing the K.J. Wright role in Atlanta\u2019s Seattle scheme. Campbell\u2019s been overshadowed by draft classmate Deion Jones over the last four years, but he\u2019s been steady, and he finished 2019 with a career-high 129 tackles. The Falcons\u2019 cap situation will make it impossible for them to bring him back, which could be someone else\u2019s gain.\n\nGraham Glasgow, G/C, Lions: He\u2019s started 47 of 48 games the last three years, and has extensive experience at both center and guard. Is he Maurkice Pouncey or Zach Martin? No. But guys like that don\u2019t make it to the market, and someone with money allocated for Joe Thuney or Brandon Schreff will strike out, and Glasgow will make a good fallback option. Remember this, too: Free-agent offensive linemen always get paid.\n\nJavon Hargrave, NT, Steelers: A starter since going in the third round in 2016, Hargrave has steadily improved and was a big part of Pittsburgh\u2019s rebirth on defense this year. He\u2019s registered 10.5 sacks over the last two years, a big number given his role in the Steelers\u2019 3\u20134, and he should be well-positioned to hit the market, with teams thinking he\u2019ll grow with increased opportunity after playing in the shadow of Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt.\n\nShelby Harris, DT, Broncos: A seventh-round pick in 2014, Harris spent his first three seasons on the fringes of the league\u2014on and off active rosters and practice squads. He found a home in Denver in 2017 and has flourished since. He won\u2019t get what Hargrave or David Onyemata will. But he won\u2019t be far off.\n\nNick Kwiatkoski, LB, Bears: Here\u2019s the guy who\u2019d never really gotten the chance to be a full-time starter, then did\u2026 at just the right time. The fourth-year former fourth-round pick started Chicago\u2019s final seven games and showed that he can play the middle for someone, and he could get paid after guys like Cory Littleton and Joe Schobert come off the board. And maybe that someone will be his old coordinator, Vic Fangio in Denver.\n\nCory Littleton, LB, Rams: You need to protect him a little bit\u2014he\u2019s not the most stout inside linebacker\u2014but Littleton is a playmaker through and through. Last year, he had 134 tackles, 3.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, nine passes defensed and two picks. In 2018, he had four sacks, 13 passes defensed and three picks, plus a touchdown and a safety. And Littleton\u2019s been one of the NFL\u2019s best special teamers to boot.\n\nDavid Onyemata, DT, Saints: New Orleans took a fourth-round flier on Onyemata, a product of the University of Manitoba, in 2016\u2014and it has paid off handsomely. A favorite of the coaches, the 6'4\", 300-pounder has developed into an all-around force and became a full-time starter this year. He\u2019s still got plenty of room to grow, and the Saints\u2019 cap situation dictates that he\u2019ll probably have to cash in somewhere else.\n\nD.J. Reader, DT, Texans: Lots of defensive tackles here? Lots of defensive tackles here. Reader was a fifth-round pick in 2016 and is awfully athletic for a 327-pounder, and the thought could be that he\u2019s still got upside left as a pass-rusher. The Texans would love to keep him, and we\u2019ll see if they can.\n\n***\n\nREASONS TO BELIEVE IN PHILIP RIVERS\n\nMike McCoy was Philip Rivers\u2019s head coach from 2013\u201316. He remained his neighbor in San Diego since then. Until Rivers packed his family up and left for the Florida panhandle in January, the two shared a neighborhood outside the city. And so when it became clear that Rivers was done with the Chargers, even if the Chargers aren\u2019t in San Diego anymore, it hit McCoy on a couple different fronts.\n\n\u201cHow fortunate you are as an organization to have someone like that for as long as they did,\u201d McCoy said, over the phone from San Diego on Sunday. \u201cHe\u2019s the ultimate professional, does everything the right way, he\u2019s just the best. But he\u2019s also such a good person. That\u2019s the one thing I hope isn\u2019t lost. Everyone sees Philip Rivers on Sunday, but to see the way he prepared, the way he did things, how he treated the other players, he\u2019s fantastic.\u201d\n\nA lot of nice things have been said about Rivers over the last week, and it\u2019s justified.\n\nHe\u2019s sixth all-time in passing touchdowns, sixth all-time in passing yards, 10th all-time in passer rating, and there are few Charger records pertaining to a quarterback that he doesn\u2019t hold. But the reason why I think there may still be a little gas left in the tank comes down to what McCoy was saying, in describing his old neighbor as a person.\n\nMcCoy, you might remember, was Peyton Manning\u2019s offensive coordinator, as the then-Bronco was coming back from four neck surgeries. Manning\u2019s arm wasn\u2019t what it had been, but by the time he was healthy enough to play, that didn\u2019t matter. He could outthink everyone, which allowed him to anticipate throws\u2014which more than made up for a couple fewer RPMs on the ball.\n\nAs we talked, McCoy basically painted the same picture for me on Rivers. I didn\u2019t realize it until after we talked and was looking over my notes. So I called McCoy back. He didn\u2019t want to compare one all-timer with another, specifically. But he didn\u2019t disagree with the notion.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt in my mind, wherever goes next, Philip\u2019s going to be very successful,\u201d McCoy said when I circled back. \u201cHe\u2019s still got it. He can still play the game. The mental part is what\u2019s the key, his knowledge of the game. Some of these guys may not have the arm they had\u2014and I don\u2019t think Philip\u2019s lost much, if anything\u2014but they can make up for it with anticipation. The great ones have that. And they know their own strengths and weaknesses, their own limitations, better than anyone.\n\n\u201cSo maybe you gotta anticipate more. Well, go back and watch some of the in-cuts Philip threw this year and tell me what you see.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate that dynamic during our earlier conversation, McCoy raised how Rivers attended his introductory press conference\u2014and immediately wanted to go to work on putting the offense in. The two melded the offense Norv Turner ran over the six years prior and what McCoy brought schematically, and, per McCoy, there wasn\u2019t so much as a hiccup in making it work. \u201cReally from that first day,\u201d McCoy said, \u201cI knew this guy was special.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis football intelligence is off the charts\u2014off the charts,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cHis knowledge of the game, you\u2019re lucky when you\u2019re around a guy like this. A defense says the same code word twice, he\u2019ll expose it. You\u2019re not gonna fool him often. And the chess match we had in practice, him and [Eric] Weddle, they went at it every day.\u201d\n\nWhich was one more way, McCoy said, \u201cYou could see he truly loves the game of football. It shows all the time. Every Sunday was a gem to him. Didn\u2019t matter what our record was, how many injuries we had, what time of year it was, he played the game like he was a little kid.\u201d\n\nSo all that\u2014his passion for and knowledge of the game\u2014won\u2019t be everything in determining what becomes of Rivers in 2020, wherever he lands. But I happen to think it\u2019s a pretty decent starting point for a guy who\u2019ll turn 39 later this year.\n\n***\n\nIn his fifth year with the Niners, Armstead had a team-best 10 sacks. Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nALL-32\n\nI don\u2019t know why it took me this long to think of it, but I think the 49ers should look into tagging Arik Armstead with the purpose of trading him. Last year, it worked for both the Chiefs (Dee Ford) and Seahawks (Frank Clark) and brought home a significantly stronger return than the comp-pick system would\u2019ve. Now the gamble here would be that Armstead could sign the tender, and then you have trouble finding a suitor, and your cap room (the Niners are expected to have around $20 million in breathing room) would effectively be gone if you couldn\u2019t arrange a deal to offload him before the start of the league year. But the Niners should be able to investigate the trade market sufficiently at the combine to determine whether or not it\u2019s a good idea to franchise him. So\u2026 this makes sense to me.\n\nInteresting hearing that new Bears OC Bill Lazor said on the Coaches Show on WBBM in Chicago that he actually recruited Mitchell Trubisky when Trubisky was an underclassman at Mentor (Ohio) High and Lazor was a Virginia assistant. Lazor\u2019s job will be an important one, in organizing all the voices helping the quarterback, with QBs coach John DeFilippo, pass-game coordinator Dave Ragone, along with head coach Matt Nagy, among those that\u2019ll be trying to help kickstart Trubisky\u2019s development. Interestingly enough, all four of those coaches were Division I college quarterbacks.\n\nOne win for Bengals coach Zac Taylor: He\u2019s been able to come through the ups and downs of last season with a respectful relationship with Andy Dalton in place. It makes sense that Dalton wants to find a place where he can start next year, with the presumption that Cincinnati is going quarterback with the first pick. Similarly, as Taylor tried to build a strong rapport with his players, it makes sense for the team to do right by Dalton and work with him on that.\n\nThe Bills are flush with cap space. They project to have around $80 million to spend, and that\u2019s before they make moves ahead of the league year (releasing Trent Murphy, for example, would create another $7 million or so). And they\u2019ve drafted very, very well the last three years, which puts them in position to take full advantage of having their quarterback on a rookie deal. Now, they just need that quarterback, Josh Allen, to come through for them.\n\nShould free agents Chris Harris and Derek Wolfe depart, then Von Miller will be the only member of the 2015 Broncos defense, the one that won Super Bowl 50, left. Which tells you all you need to know about the shelf life of teams built that way. In this era, with a team like that, you only get so many shots at it.\n\nWe\u2019ve mentioned here that Browns GM Andrew Berry plans to structure his front office like the Eagles do theirs\u2014with a VP of player personnel (heading up scouting) and a VP of football operations (heading up the rest of the football side) reporting to him. Berry already has two trusted confidants at his side, in Ken Kovash and Ryan Grigson. It certainly is possible that we see Kovash wind up as VP of football ops and Grigson as VP of player personnel when the reorg happens, probably after the draft.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s posturing, but it\u2019s at least interesting that Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians said this (via ESPN, from the NFL Coaches Academy): \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s my quarterback. We\u2019ve gotta have a defense.\u201d He was referencing the need to keep a defense that improved and has a boatload of free agents\u2014Shaq Barrett, Jason Pierre-Paul, Carl Nassib and Ndamukong Suh among them\u2014together. That said, given the chance to back Jameis Winston, he\u2019s been lukewarm over the last few weeks. And this is another example of it.\n\nThe Cardinals\u2019 inability to cut David Johnson is another cautionary tale on paying running backs. Half his $10.2 million salary for 2020 was guaranteed at signing in 2018. The other half vested during the 2019 offseason. To get out of that, Arizona would have had to cut him just months after signing him to that deal in August 2018, with over $13 million gone for the single year, and $9 million in dead money to account for. For not doing that? The team is tied to him this year. They can trade him, but another team would have to be willing to pay a guy who\u2019s been under 4 yards per carry two years running over $11 million this year. The Cardinals could eat some of that, but that, of course, would cut into the $8.25 million they\u2019d save on the cap by dealing him. So yeah, not a great spot for Arizona to be in.\n\nI do think Tyrod Taylor is an ideal placeholder for the Chargers. He knows Anthony Lynn\u2019s system, having run it in Buffalo. And he\u2019s worked with a young quarterback before\u2014he opened 2018 as the Browns starter before giving way to Baker Mayfield\u2014so he\u2019d probably be good for a first-round quarterback, should that be where team brass finds the next guy.\n\nThe Chiefs have some decisions to make on players (Sammy Watkins would be one), but one they\u2019ve already made their mind up on is Chris Jones. One way or another, I expect him to be a Chief in 2020. They\u2019ll try to work out a deal first, and if that doesn\u2019t work, they\u2019ll tag him. One thing that complicates his situation a little is what the Chiefs paid an outside acquisition, Clark, last offseason. You\u2019d think Jones would want at least what Clark got.\n\nOne sneaky important free agent: Colts LT Anthony Castonzo. GM Chris Ballard\u2019s done a great job rebuilding his offensive line. Losing a left tackle would be a serious blow, because as good as the young pieces (Quenton Nelson, Ryan Kelly, Braden Smith) are, none of them have any experience playing that position. For his part, Ballard said on Indy sports radio this week that believes Castonzo has three or four good years left.\n\nWith the likelihood that the Cowboys lose Byron Jones in free agency, the continued development of young corners Chidobe Awuzie and Jourdan Lewis will be in focus with the new coaching staff. Both guys will be in contract years in 2020, and will be working with DBs coaches Maurice Linguist and Al Harris. Harris was a pretty good NFL corner himself.\n\nSoon, it\u2019ll be time for the Dolphins to start spending the capital they built last year. An overview: Miami has around $95 million in cap space and is likely to have 15 draft picks, after the comp picks are doled out, with five in the first two rounds. That\u2019s an amazing position for GM Chris Grier to operate from. But he knows as well as anyone, turning that into a cadre of great players is tougher than just amassing it.\n\nAnother name I considered for last week\u2019s cut list was Eagles WR Alshon Jeffery. The reasons they\u2019d get rid of him are there\u2014health, his place in the locker room, his price tag, and his age. The trouble is there would be major cap implications to walking away, and Philly\u2019s already thin at the position. This is a tricky one for Howie Roseman.\n\nThere\u2019s good news on the back end of the Falcons\u2019 likely divorce from running back Devonta Freeman\u2014there will be options for them in the draft. Atlanta has four of the first 80 picks, and the second and third rounds should be where a lot of the top backs (Georgia\u2019s D\u2019Andre Swift, Ohio State\u2019s J.K. Dobbins, Wisconsin\u2019s Jonathan Taylor, LSU\u2019s Clyde Edwards-Helaire) come off the board. So the hole there will likely be temporary.\n\nThis week, Leonard Williams pushed back on the notion that he\u2019s asking for $15 million from the Giants. But maybe he shouldn\u2019t? Given that the team forked over a third-round pick and a conditional fifth-rounder to get him, and his franchise tag number would be around $16 million (not happening), Williams has considerable leverage here.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go unnoticed among people connected to Tom Coughlin that the Jaguars hired his replacement in New York, Ben McAdoo, as quarterbacks coach. Funny coincidence, given all that\u2019s happened over the last two months.\n\nThe Jets\u2019 signing of CFL safety Anthony Cioffi is another example of how the NFL could really use a developmental league. Cioffi finished a very solid four-year career at Rutgers in early 2017, and went undrafted that spring. He signed with the Raiders, washed out and landed in Canada. There, he grew as a hybrid safety/linebacker (he actually started his college career as a corner) and played his way into another shot at the NFL. We\u2019ll see how this one goes, but as it is, this is a good example of a post-college guy who probably wasn\u2019t quite ready buying himself some time by playing somewhere other than the NFL.\n\nI touched base with Lions coach Matt Patricia via text on Friday on the Matthew Stafford trade report. Here\u2019s what he said: \u201cNot in any trade talks whatsoever for Matthew.\u201d I think some of this may stem from Detroit kicking the tires on some quarterbacks before last year\u2019s draft. Whatever it is, as far as I can tell, there\u2019s nothing there right now.\n\nThe likely release of Packers tight end Jimmy Graham will free up $8 million in cap space and bring the team to around $30 million in breathing room. The flip side is that it\u2019ll also eliminate a playmaker\u2014and put a little more on GM Brian Gutekunst to get playmakers for Aaron Rodgers, and on the coaches to get more out of underachieving younger guys like Marquez Valdes-Scantling.\n\nThe Panthers\u2019 continued caution on committing to Cam Newton is fine for now, but the new league year is a month away\u2014and the game of musical chairs at quarterback probably won\u2019t last long thereafter. Now, they\u2019d probably be OK going forward with Kyle Allen and Will Grier and a potential draft pick in 2020, especially considering Year 1 under Matt Rhule promises to be something of a rebuild. The issue would come if the Panthers want to get something for Newton, trade-wise. That\u2019ll be tougher to do on, say, April 1, because so many of the quarterbacking seats will be taken by then.\n\nOne win for the Patriots\u2014their 2017 contract with Dont\u2019a Hightower. It looked like there was zero chance he would see the four-year deal he signed with the team through. He had a partially torn pec, and looked like he was breaking down physically, and that was reflected in a deal that protected the team at every turn ($875,000 per year in per-game roster bonuses, $2 million per year in play-time and performance incentives). Yet, here we are, going into the final year of that deal. The pec wound up going in October 2017, ending that season after five games, but he\u2019s started 30 of 32 games the last two years, which is a big-time credit to him.\n\nA.J. Green would make a lot of sense for the Raiders. And regardless of the quarterback situation (it\u2019s safe to say the team sees the floor as sticking with Derek Carr, and the ceiling obviously may be somewhere else), the Raiders would probably be a good fit for Green.\n\nThe Rams introduced their new coordinators last week, and one thing I like about the hires is pretty simple: There\u2019s strong reasoning behind them. Defensive coordinator Brandon Staley had connections to Sean McVay through Chris Shula, Staley drew interest from multiple teams, and a big part McVay\u2019s motivation in pursuing him was how hard a time he had coaching against defenses led by Vic Fangio, Staley\u2019s boss last year in Denver. As for offensive coordinator Kevin O\u2019Connell, McVay saw the need for more hands-on coaching with Jared Goff, given the losses of Matt LaFleur, Greg Olson and Zac Taylor over the last three years, and few would be better suited to fill that role than O\u2019Connell, who filled the role (Jay Gruden\u2019s OC) that McVay once did in Washington.\n\nWe mentioned this with the Niners a few weeks back, and it goes for the Ravens too\u2014huge win for the team keeping its coaching staff intact. That coordinators Greg Roman and Wink Martindale will return is huge for the young guys, as will be having Roman and QBs coach James Urban back for Lamar Jackson.\n\nIn the wake of the Redskins shedding Josh Norman and Paul Richardson, many anticipated something happening with tight end Jordan Reed on Friday. I\u2019m told that situation has to be handled differently because of Reed\u2019s injury situation\u2014concussion issues landed him on IR last October. He last played in a game in 2018.\n\nInteresting aspect of the Saints\u2019 situation with Drew Brees: His contract is up. The last time we were here, a two-year, $50 million deal got done without incident, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be one this time if Brees to decides to play in 2021. But an already tight-to-the-cap New Orleans team will have to be creative cap-wise, because Brees has $15.9 million in dead money to deal with, which means he\u2019d have the second highest cap number on the team if he decided not to play. And then, there\u2019s the fact that Brees\u2019s deal could well be a market setter for Philip Rivers and Tom Brady.\n\nI personally think it\u2019d be tough for the Seahawks to bring Michael Bennett back. Too much history for both sides to wade through there.\n\nBig Steelers news that slid slightly under the radar this week. And GM Kevin Colbert was the one to say it for himself: \u201cI\u2019m not looking to ever go anywhere else again as long as the Rooneys and Steelers are interested in me.\u201d Assuming Colbert\u2019s being forthright, that means he\u2019s open to sticking around a few more years, and also that he\u2019d resist anyone trying to poach him. Rumors have swirled for over a year that Panthers owner David Tepper, a former Steelers minority owner, might make a run at adding Colbert to his front office.\n\nShould CB A.J. Bouye wind up a cap casualty in Jacksonville, his return to the Texans almost makes too much sense. When Houston let him go, Rick Smith was still the GM. The coaches loved him. So with a long-standing need at that position, Bradley Roby a free agent and Vernon Hargreaves cut, bringing back an old friend might make sense for Houston.\n\nTitans GM Jon Robinson has pulled together a really solid roster over the last four years, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how he handles the first draft pick of his tenure. Right tackle Jack Conklin is a free agent, and good offensive linemen always get paid in free agency. So whether it\u2019s Tennessee or someone else paying that freight, you can bet Robinson will be wishing, at the end, that he\u2019d be picked up Conklin\u2019s $12.87 million option for 2020. The Titans declined it, largely due to Conklin\u2019s injury problems.\n\nA lot\u2019s been made over the Vikings defensive coordinator situation, with Andre Patterson and Adam Zimmer sharing the role in 2020. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably not worth spending much time worrying about. Mike Zimmer was one of the best defensive play-callers in the league for over a decade as a coordinator, so he\u2019ll be more than able to make up for an experience deficit the two new guys bring.\n\n***\n\nTOP FIVE\n\nCBA talks are entering a critical stretch. The NFLPA held a meeting of its exec board and player reps on Jan. 30 in Miami and again on Feb. 6 in L.A. Another Thursday meeting is set for this week in D.C. Coming out of the L.A. meeting, the NFLPA gave the league a list of its issues with its proposal, and the league countered with another proposal. The union and league will continue dialogue this week, so tweaks could come to the most recent proposal, and the players will decide in D.C. whether to vote on what they have in front of them or counter. The good news? A lot of the economic issues have been worked out. The biggest divide, at this point, concerns minimum salaries. The bad news is that the idea of a 17-game season still remains an issue, and Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill\u2019s comments last week didn\u2019t help. The league and union are trying to grind through new work rules\u2014offseason, training camp, and in-season\u2014that would lighten the physical and mental load on the players, should there be a 17th game. And the NFL\u2019s given the players its word that the new schedule won\u2019t come until 2021, at the absolute earliest. I was told on Friday that a vote this week remains unlikely. But things are moving in the right direction. The NFLPA has its annual rep meeting from March 7\u201310, during which they\u2019ll elect a new president. Given Eric Winston\u2019s role over the last few years, finding common ground before then seems like it\u2019d be critical for both sides.\n\nNick Caserio\u2019s staying in New England. The Patriots are keeping their director of player personnel, and I think this is a situation where you have to give ownership credit. As was the case with Josh McDaniels a couple years ago, the Krafts recognized that, given the age of the coach (67 now, 68 on opening day) and quarterback (42 now, 43 on opening day, and a free agent), stacking young guys who could continue to ascend in different parts of football operations would be vital. So maybe Caserio will get the GM title eventually\u2014no one\u2019s had that in New England over Kraft\u2019s 26 seasons of ownership\u2014or maybe McDaniels will be the head coach. The key is the team has created in-house options for itself. Two other aspects of Caserio\u2019s imminent new deal are worth noting, as well. First, as it\u2019s structured now, the Patriots have three guys atop their scouting department\u2014Caserio, pro director Dave Ziegler and college director Monti Ossenfort. Both Caserio and Ossenfort\u2019s deals were set to expire in May, leaving Ziegler as the only one signed for this season (he\u2019s up after the 2021 draft). So a potentially destabilizing circumstance loomed, and now that\u2019s been addressed. Second, Caserio\u2019s role as quasi-coach (he\u2019s in McDaniels\u2019s headset from the booth on gameday) and jack-of-all-trades made it so it probably would\u2019ve taken multiple guys to cover the difference he makes for the organization. All of which means, all the way around, this is a great development for the Patriots.\n\nUnder Bieniemy, the Chiefs averaged 39.0 points per game in the postseason. David Richard/AP/Shutterstock\n\nKicking tires on Colorado wouldn\u2019t be crazy for Eric Bieniemy. And I get the logic people are pushing that the Chiefs\u2019 OC should stay in the NFL and take his shot at a head coaching job next year. But I\u2019d use Bill O\u2019Brien and Matt Rhule as examples of what going into a difficult situation at the college level can do for a guy\u2019s NFL stock. In 2012, after three years as the Patriots\u2019 offensive play-caller, O\u2019Brien was considered a wild-card candidate for the Jaguars\u2019 opening, and had been connected to many other jobs. He went to post-Sandusky Penn State. He did a great job. By 2014, he was the hottest candidate on the NFL market, and went to a pretty stable franchise in Houston. Likewise, Rhule could\u2019ve bailed for the NFL a year ago, and into a broken situation with the Jets. He stayed an extra year as Baylor\u2019s fireman, completed the rebuild there and wound up commanding an unheard-of seven-year deal to be new Panthers owner David Tepper\u2019s first coaching hire. Point is, there is benefit in doing it that way. Bieniemy will almost certainly be in the mix again next year for jobs. Coaching Patrick Mahomes protects his stock the way coaching Brady once protected O\u2019Brien\u2019s. But a great couple years at his alma mater could wind up giving him his pick of jobs. And I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what he should do. I am saying the move would be understandable.\n\nThe Myles Garrett/Mason Rudolph situation will only get uglier. I\u2019ve felt this way from the moment Garrett\u2019s accusation that a racial slur from Rudolph ignited the November fracas in Cleveland (which ended with Garrett swinging a helmet at Rudolph)\u2014one way or the other, something awful happened. If Rudolph is guilty of what Garrett says he is, then it\u2019s self-explanatory how bad that is. If Rudolph\u2019s not guilty, then Garrett\u2019s handling of this, after he doubled down with ESPN\u2019s Mina Kimes this week, is even worse. Barring Garrett retracting what he said, the accusation is something Rudolph will have to wear for the rest of his career, which is wildly unfair if he\u2019s innocent. If you want an idea of the impact here, just turn on the TV. It wasn\u2019t hard to find segments the other day breaking down the \u201cif he\u2019d done this\u201d scenario. Which, if someone is just tuning in mid-stream, might cause people to assume he\u2019s guilty. In that sense, a lot of damage has already been done.\n\nXFL\u2019s got its work cut out for it. Through six games (going into Sunday\u2019s action), five unders had hit, and no game had been decided by fewer than 6 points. The Tampa Bay Vipers, coached by a noted offensive guru in Marc Trestman, haven\u2019t scored a touchdown on offense yet. And the reasons why, I think, are pretty simple. The NFL has a depth issue at quarterback and along the offensive line, so naturally the XFL was always going to have problems filling out those positions. The AAF addressed that with rules severely limiting blitzing. The XFL hasn\u2019t, and defensive coaches are starting to catch on to the fact that linemen are having trouble identifying and blocking pressure. So they\u2019re sending guys. It\u2019s led to offenses having problems moving the ball, and quarterbacks getting hit. And the tough thing is, if they want to be a developmental league, those are the two positions I believe the NFL would be most interested in them working on. Maybe there could be rules tweaks in-season?\n\n***\n\nSIX FROM THE SIDELINES\n\n1) Since the Astros either hired the wrong crisis management people, or didn\u2019t listen to the ones they had, I\u2019d like to offer this statement for owner Jim Crane: \u201cI own the team and the buck stops with me. As a result, even if I wasn\u2019t directly involved, I\u2019m accountable for everything that happened over the last few years, and this has been an embarrassing episode for all of us. From this point forward, I promise to do my best to uphold a higher standard of integrity, and hire people who\u2019ll do the same, within this organization. I sincerely apologize for our actions.\u201d Bottom line, they didn\u2019t have to make things so hard on themselves.\u201d\n\n2) As I type this, I have no idea who won the dunk contest. And now I\u2019ll go look it up\u2026 Derrick Jones Jr. Not sure who that is. But I\u2019m pretty sure this is another sign that all-star games in professional sports are sort of outdated. The Pro Bowl sucks. I don\u2019t think the other ones are very good either. Or necessary anymore. (Update: I guess the actual NBA All-Star Game was pretty good last night, according to what was on Twitter.)\n\n3) Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan make up one heck of a Hall of Fame class.\n\n4) Billy Donovan had the court at the Univ. of Florida named after him this week, and I\u2019m not sure he gets the credit he deserves for what he accomplished there. To do what he did at a dyed-in-the-wool football school\u2014capturing back-to-back national titles in hoops\u2014remains absolutely incredible.\n\n5) The Michigan State coaching search ended with Mel Tucker landing a deal worth $5.5 million per year, and illustrated why, again, the SEC and Big 10 have separated themselves from the rest of the country. Remember, it was a Pac-12 school with a national title in the last 30 years that couldn\u2019t keep up with the fourth program in the Big 10 East.\n\n6) Obviously, the rape case at my alma mater, Ohio State, is unspeakably awful. I\u2019m glad that Ryan Day didn\u2019t waste any time taking action.\n\n***\n\nBEST OF THE NFL INTERNET\n\nIt\u2019s impossible not to root for Teddy Bridgewater.\n\nOr Ron Rivera, for that matter. The new Redskins coach held a Bud Grant-style yard sale of his old Panthers gear, and he and wife Stephanie raised $30,000 for the Humane Society of Charlotte. Awesome way for them to say goodbye.\n\nVery fair take from Bobby Carpenter. And I love that: Bad things happen when good people choose to do nothing.\n\nAnd this would be a fair question.\n\nJust when you thought the ol\u2019 Gatorade bath had gotten stale.\n\nGod bless Scott Simpson.\n\nYou guys know where I fall on this. S/o to Dianna for asking the question too, and getting the correct answer.\n\nWhat\u2019s really tough for Mason Rudolph is it\u2019s almost impossible to prove a negative.\n\nMatt Rhule\u2019s first tweet as Panthers coach\u2026 Live from Daytona.\n\nThis is a fun watch.\n\n***\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nAnd maybe this is more looking forward than looking back, but I figured it\u2019d be fun to go back to my review from this summer of Joe Burrow, who was coming off a good-not-great redshirt junior season, his first at LSU.\n\nEvery year, during our draft week in July, I do full once-over of the quarterback class to come, to give you guys a picture of how those in the know see the best prospects at the most important position. The hope is to give you stuff to pay attention to, from an NFL perspective, during the college season. Here\u2019s how we looked at Burrow:\n\nBurrow was in the thick of a position battle with [Dwayne] Haskins in 2018 at Ohio State, then transferred to LSU and caught fire at the end of last year. And he\u2019s got some physical ability, and size\u2014and a pretty decent situation around him to boot.\n\n\u201cLSU\u2019s one of those teams, when you play them, you see it\u2019s built on good play at every other position but quarterback,\u201d [Jordan] Palmer said. \u201cBut the last five games, he went off, and they\u2019re bringing back pass-rushers, corners, three good running backs. It\u2019s all there. He has a chance to have special year, and you can see it\u2019s not too big for him.\u201d\n\nAnd he sure did have a special year. But when I wrote that, the thought was maybe he plays his way into the second round, after being seen as a third- or fourth-rounder. I\u2019m not sure anyone saw what was coming.\n\nSo what do you need to know? I think Burrow\u2019s case is another example that shows we shouldn\u2019t draw sweeping conclusions on college players before their eligibility is up. Similar to Burrow, Baker Mayfield was seen as a middle-round prospect going into his final year at Oklahoma. Kyler Murray was seen as a baseball player. Both went first overall the following April, as Burrow is expected to.\n\nRight now, Clemson\u2019s Trevor Lawrence and Ohio State\u2019s Justin Fields look like the cream of the 2021 crop. But a lot can happen between now and next April.\n\nQuestion or comment?

Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Sunday that would have brought new oversight of California\u2019s dog blood industry that supplies veterinary hospitals with lifesaving products for pets in the state, saying the proposal approved by lawmakers \u201cdoes not go far enough.\u201d\n\nInstead, Newsom said he wants legislators to send him a bill that would phase out the use of \u201cclosed colonies,\u201d in which dogs are \u201ckept in cages for months and years to harvest their blood for sale.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe legislation should provide for the safe and humane treatment of donor animals, the welfare of the recipients and adequate oversight and enforcement of this program,\u201d the governor wrote in his veto message.\n\nUnder Senate Bill 202 by state Sen. Scott Wilk (R-Santa Clarita), California would have joined the rest of the country in allowing dog owners to volunteer their pets to donate blood while continuing to allow closed colonies to operate. With the veto, the state will continue to require that veterinarians purchase blood products solely from companies that house donor animals for the purpose of drawing their blood every 10 to 14 days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSB 202 also would have rolled back sweeping public records exemptions that have allowed private animal blood companies in the state to operate colonies of caged donor dogs under a cloak of secrecy. SB 202 would have made public annual inspection reports by the California Department of Food and Agriculture, information that has been shielded from disclosure since the state first began examining the facilities in 2002.\n\nWilk said the state must allow for additional sources of dog blood amid a national shortage and that the bill would have made \u201ca real difference\u201d for pets in need. The need for dog blood has been rising across the country as more pet owners opt to treat injuries and diseases that require blood transfusions.\n\nSome animal welfare groups were unhappy with SB 202 and instead wanted legislation allowing voluntary pet donations while phasing out the use of dogs housed as blood suppliers, but a bill to do so died amid opposition from the California Veterinary Medical Assn. The veterinary group argued that eliminating the use of company-owned donor dogs could create a massive blood shortage that would put the injured and sick animals they care for at risk.\n\nNewsom\u2019s veto message made clear he believes the animal blood donor system should change and that housing dogs for the purpose of drawing their blood is not the answer. Instead of making an incremental change, he asked for a new bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cUntil you have a dog who is a family member in crisis, you don\u2019t understand how ridiculous the system is in California,\u201d said Kassy Perry, a longtime communications professional in the state Capitol who began advocating for SB 202 last week after her daughter\u2019s dog nearly died when the veterinarian could not get the necessary blood products for him. \u201cWhy would you not allow for voluntary donations now and go after closed colonies next if you chose?\u201d\n\nThe operators of the two animal blood banks in California \u2014 Hemopet and Animal Blood Bank Resources International \u2014 say housing colonies of donor dogs ensures a regular supply of safe blood for veterinarians. Greyhounds make up the bulk of blood donors at the facilities because of their generally docile temperament and their \u201cuniversal\u201d blood type, which can be used to treat any breed.\n\nThe owner of Hemopet said her Garden Grove facility has more than 200 greyhounds that were former racing dogs in other states. Animal Blood Bank Resources International, based in Dixon, does not disclose where its donor dogs are kept or how many animals it has. That information would be available on the state\u2019s inspection reports that would be made public under SB 202.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://deadline.com/2020/05/upload-renewed-season-2-amazon-greg-daniels-1202929763/", "authors": ["Denise Petski"], "title": "\u2018Upload\u2019 Renewed For Season 2 By Amazon", "text": "Just a week after its season 1 premiere, Amazon Studios has ordered a second season of sci-fi comedy series Upload, from The Office creator Greg Daniels.

The idea is to let you monitor and manage your family\u2019s time on the internet. Plus, it can give you stats about your Children\u2019s PC and Xbox.\n\nThe app lets you monitor app usage and website visits across devices \u2014 but only if you use Microsoft\u2018s Edge browser. Plus, it sends you weekly usage reports, and fires off alerts when your kids make a purchase on the Microsoft or Xbox store.\n\nCredit: Microsoft Weekly app report\n\nFirst, you need to download the app on your device and ask your family members to do so too. App restriction across Android, PC, and Xbox is probably the most prominent feature. You can also set up content search filters, but if your children use Chrome or any other browser, they can easily search for stuff they don\u2019t want you to see.\n\nNow, to set up app restrictions, you will need to add your children from the home screen. Once they join the family group, ask them to go to settings and turn on Activity Reporting. The app will also prompt you to enable Accessibility and Usage Limit settings in your children\u2019s phone. This is the only way you can set up app timers.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n\nTap on your child\u2018s name in your Family Saftey app\n\nTap the screen time report to see the list of apps installed on their device\n\nTap on a particular app to set a time limit or block the app.\n\nOnce you tap on the Time Limit button, you define the number of hours and days of the week to allow usage of the app. You can also set up the timeframe of the day when they can use the app.\n\nIf your children open any of the blocked apps, the app will close immediately, and they\u2019ll get a notification asking them to get permission from you to use the app.\n\nThere are a couple of things you need to keep in mind. App blocking and restrictions from the third-party apps are not allowed on iOS. So, this app is primarily useful if your family uses Android and Windows-based devices.\n\nAlso, if you want to set up content and search filters, you\u2019ll need to block other browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.\n\nYou can read about all the features available in the family safety app here.\n\nRead next: A look at the best new features in Python 3.9", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/voicemailtrumps-lawyer-asks-michael-flynns-attorney-heads/story?id=63542167", "authors": ["Abc News"], "title": "On voicemail,Trump's lawyer asks Michael Flynn's attorney for a 'heads up'", "text": "Government prosecutors have released the audio recording of a voicemail from Pres.

Garoppolo and his scary injury", "text": "Jimmy Garoppolo is hurt again, yet somehow that injury is being viewed as the stiff breeze that cracks open the door for the 29-year-old to make his triumphant return to Foxboro.\n\nBill Belichick and Josh McDaniels may very well believe that Garoppolo is totally capable of being the next trigger man for their offense. They may very well be right. But the evidence refuting that belief is piling up.\n\nWe've been over Garoppolo's on-the-field shortcomings.\n\nHe very rarely throws the ball deep, despite that being a key portion of Kyle Shanahan's offense when he feels he has a quarterback capable of making such throws. Matt Ryan, for example, won MVP in 2016 and was in the top-15 of the NFL in terms of deep-passing rate playing under Shanahan in Atlanta.\n\nPatriots Talk Podcast: Did the Patriots blow it at the trade deadline? | Listen & subscribe | Watch on YouTube\n\nWhen Garoppolo does heave it deep, he's been bad. His quarterback rating on passes that travel over 20 yards beyond the line of scrimmage this season is 2.1. In 10 attempts, he's completed one pass (against the Patriots in Week 7) and he has two picks. Had he simply taken those deep attempts and chucked them out of bounds, his rating would be 39.6.\n\nBut thanks in large part to the fact that he plays for one of the game's brightest offensive minds in San Francisco, and because he's surrounded by playmakers who pick up chunks of yardage after receptions, Garoppolo's numbers look passable. Despite throwing shorter than every NFL quarterback outside of Drew Brees, he's 10th in yards per attempt this season (7.8).\n\nStill, Garoppolo has a below-average 7-to-5 touchdown-to-interception ratio and a quarterback rating (92.4) that places him 24th in the NFL this season.\n\nNow he's banged up. Again.\n\nThis trend began in 2016 when Garoppolo suffered a shoulder injury rolling out of the pocket in his second start as a pro, replacing the then-suspended Tom Brady. After being traded and winning five games with the Niners in 2017, Garoppolo tore his ACL in late September of 2018 trying to pick up a few extra yards at the end of a scramble with his team trailing by two touchdowns in the fourth quarter.\n\nThis year's ankle issue included, that's three significant injuries in five seasons. He has one year of experience as a wire-to-wire starter.\n\nWhile his missed time in previous seasons has been used as an excuse as to why Garoppolo hadn't yet reached the heights he would in 2020 and beyond, missed time is now looking more like the expectation for him. If he's unavailable for the rest of this year, he will have missed 44 percent of the games he should have started since 2016.\n\nThat's too many for any starter. That's a disaster for a player given a deal that would pay him an average of $27.5 million per season two years ago. The Niners are 4-11 without Garoppolo since he signed his second contract.\n\nWith or Without You Jimmy Garoppolo's win percentage as San Francisco's starting QB (22-8). 73.3% San Francisco's win percentage with Garoppolo out of action & injured (4-11). 26.7%\n\nAnd now it seems almost a fait accompli that he'll be elsewhere in 2021. The Niners can get out from under Garoppolo's contract with less than $3 million in dead money hitting their books this coming offseason while simultaneously freeing up more than $24 million in cap space.\n\nWhat's it all mean? Should the Patriots want to welcome Garoppolo back if he's available?\n\nThey're in a beggars-can't-be-choosers spot at the position. But if given the choice to trade a draft pick -- say it takes a second-rounder, as ESPN suggested it could -- and re-acquire him on his current contract, the answer should be a quick-and-easy no.\n\nIf the draft-pick compensation in a trade isn't quite that high, if the Patriots can convince Garoppolo to take a pay cut, then the conversation becomes more interesting.\n\nBut, as would be the case if the Patriots traded a pick for Sam Darnold or any other roll-of-the-dice at the position, Garoppolo would have to be part of a multi-pronged approach behind center. (Darnold, in fact, might be a more attractive piece in many respects. He has some upside that Garoppolo might not at this stage in his career. He's on a cheaper contract. And he's more durable, having started 32 of 38 games through two-plus seasons.)\n\nIt'd be a nice story: The Patriots' Prodigal Son. But at the moment, Garoppolo is an average player with a scary injury history on a hefty salary. And a reunion might require the Patriots parting ways with precious draft capital.\n\nFor a team that places dependability at the top of the list of quarterbacking traits, bringing back Garoppolo doesn't quite add up.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnet.com/how-to/turn-your-fire-tv-into-a-larger-amazon-echo-show-heres-how/", "authors": ["Katie Conner"], "title": "Turn your Fire TV into a larger Amazon Echo Show.

You can now turn a Fire TV into an Echo Show and control it with the Echo speaker you already have.\n\nNot only does it provide you with a much larger screen than the Echo Show, but it can also display your front door camera on the TV screen. It also eliminates the need to use your Fire Stick remote to control the TV by letting you control everything with just your voice.

For example, if you ask Alexa to play a movie, it'll ask you to confirm that you want to use your Alexa device to control your Fire TV. Once you do this, you can say something like \"Alexa, show me the weather,\" which Alexa will display on the TV, rather than vocally telling you the weather through the speaker.\n\nYou can also say, \"Alexa, scroll left/right\" to navigate on the screen.

World health officials want to see how well the vaccine works in Malawi, Ghana and Kenya before recommending its wider use.(AP Photo/Jerome Delay)\n\nTOMALI, Malawi (AP) \u2014 A pinch in the leg, a squeal and a trickle of tears. One baby after another in Malawi is getting the first and only vaccine against malaria, one of history\u2019s deadliest and most stubborn of diseases.\n\nThe southern African nation is rolling out the shots in an unusual pilot program along with Kenya and Ghana. Unlike established vaccines that offer near-complete protection, this new one is only about 40% effective. But experts say it\u2019s worth a try as progress against malaria stalls: Resistance to treatment is growing and the global drop in cases has leveled off.\n\nWith the vaccine, the hope is to help small children through the most dangerous period of their lives. Spread by mosquito bites, malaria kills more than 400,000 people every year, two-thirds of them under 5 and most in Africa.\n\nSeven-month-old Charity Nangware received a shot on a rainy December day at a health clinic in the town of Migowi. She watched curiously as the needle slid into her thigh, then twisted up her face with a howl.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited about this,\u201d said her mother, Esther Gonjani, who herself gets malaria\u2019s aches, chills and fever at least once a year and loses a week of field work when one of her children is ill. \u201cThey explained it wasn\u2019t perfect, but I feel secure it will relieve the pain.\u201d\n\nThere is little escaping malaria -- \u201cmalungo\u201d in the local Chichewa language -- especially during the five-month rainy season. Stagnant puddles, where mosquitoes breed, surround the homes of brick and thatch and line the dirt roads through tea plantations or fields of maize and sugar cane.\n\nIn the village of Tomali, the nearest health clinic is a two-hour bike ride away. The longer it takes to get care, the more dangerous malaria can be. Teams from the clinic offer basic medical care during visits once or twice a month, bringing the malaria shot and other vaccines in portable coolers.\n\nTreating malaria takes up a good portion of their time during the rainy season, according to Daisy Chikonde, a local health worker.\n\n\u201cIf this vaccine works, it will reduce the burden,\u201d she said.\n\nResident Doriga Ephrem proudly said her 5-month-old daughter, Grace, didn\u2019t cry when she got the malaria shot.\n\nWhen she heard about the vaccine, Ephrem said her first thought was \u201cprotection is here.\u201d Health workers explained, however, that the vaccine is not meant to replace antimalarial drugs or the insecticide-treated bed net she unfolds every night as the sun sets and mosquitoes rise from the shadows.\n\n\u201cWe even take our evening meals inside the net to avoid mosquitoes,\u201d she said.\n\nIt took three decades of research to develop the new vaccine, which works against the most common and deadly of the five parasite species that cause malaria. The parasite\u2019s complex life cycle is a huge challenge. It changes forms in different stages of infection and is far harder to target than germs.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any vaccines against parasites in routine use. This is uncharted territory,\u201d said Ashley Birkett, who directs PATH\u2019s Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a nonprofit that helped drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline develop the shot, brand-named Mosquirix.\n\nThe bite of an infected mosquito sends immature parasites called sporozoites into the bloodstream. If they reach the liver, they\u2019ll mature and multiply before spewing back into the blood to cause malaria\u2019s debilitating symptoms. At that point, treatment requires medicines that kill the parasites.\n\nMosquirix uses a piece of the parasite \u2014 a protein found only on sporozoites\u2019 surface \u2014 in hopes of blocking the liver stage of infection. When a vaccinated child is bitten, the immune system should recognize the parasite and start making antibodies against it.\n\nScientists also are searching for next-generation alternatives. In the pipeline is an experimental vaccine made of whole malaria parasites dissected from mosquitoes\u2019 salivary glands but weakened so they won\u2019t make people sick. Sanaria Inc. has been testing its vaccine in adults, and is planning a large, late-stage study in Equatorial Guinea\u2019s Bioko Island.\n\nAnd the U.S. National Institutes of Health soon will start initial tests of whether injecting people periodically with lab-made antibodies, rather than depending on the immune system to make them, could offer temporary protection during malaria season. Think of them as \u201cpotentially short-term vaccines,\u201d NIH\u2019s Dr. Robert Seder told a recent meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.\n\nFor now, only babies in parts of Malawi, Kenya and Ghana are eligible for the Mosquirix vaccine. After the vaccine was approved in 2015, the World Health Organization said it first wanted a pilot roll-out to see how well it worked in a few countries \u2014 in real-world conditions \u2014 before recommending that the vaccine be given more widely across Africa.\n\n\u201cEveryone is looking forward to getting it,\u201d said Temwa Mzengeza, who oversees Malawi\u2019s vaccine programs. Those eager for the shots include her husband, whom she had to stop from trying to get them, she said.\n\nMzengeza used to come down with malaria several times a year until she started following her own advice to sleep under a net every night. Unlike many other kinds of infections, people can get malaria repeatedly, building up only a partial immunity.\n\nIn the pilot program that began last year, 360,000 children in the three countries are meant to be vaccinated annually. The first dose is given at about age 5 months and the final, fourth booster near the child\u2019s second birthday.\n\nExperts say it is too early to know how well the vaccine is working. They\u2019re watching for malaria deaths, severe infections and cases of meningitis, something reported during studies but not definitively linked to the vaccine.\n\n\u201cTo do something completely new for malaria is exciting,\u201d said researcher Don Mathanga, who is leading the evaluation in Malawi.\n\nThe rainy season has brought new challenges, making some rural roads impassable and complicating efforts to track down children due for a shot. So far in Malawi, the first dose reached about half of the children targeted, about 35,000. That dropped to 26,000 for the second dose and 20,000 for the third.\n\nThat\u2019s not surprising for a new vaccine, Mzengeza said. \u201cIt will pick up with time.\u201d\n\nAt the health clinic in Migowi in Malawi\u2019s southern highlands, workers see signs of hope. Henry Kadzuwa explains the vaccine to mothers waiting at the clinic. He said there was a drop in malaria cases to 40 in the first five months of the program, compared to 78 in the same period in 2018.\n\nEven though he wishes his 3-year-old daughter, Angel, could receive the vaccine, \u201cit\u2019s protecting my community. It also makes my work easier,\u201d Kadzuwa said. The Migowi area has one of the country\u2019s highest rates of malaria, and a worn paper register in the clinic\u2019s laboratory lists scores of cases.\n\nAt the clinic, Agnes Ngubale said she had malaria several years ago and wants to protect her 6-month-old daughter, Lydia, from the disease.\n\n\u201cI want her to be healthy and free,\u201d she said. \u201cI want her to be a doctor.\u201d\n\nAnd she has memorized the time for Lydia\u2019s second dose: \u201cNext month, same date.\u201d\n\n___\n\nNeergaard reported from Washington.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

China was fully halting business with the NBA and its players. As The Athletic's Bill Oram reported from Shenzhen, Kyle Kuzma was set to announce new sponsorship deals while in China, but they were scrapped once the team arrived in Shanghai because of the controversy.\n\n\"This coincides with what happened to the Rockets. Sources told The Athletic that at least two Houston players had sponsorship negotiations stall out in China after the impact of Morey's post began to spiral.\"\n\nMorey, in a since-deleted tweet, posted \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong\" in support of the Hong Kong protestors. Those protests began in response to an extradition bill that would have allowed for Hong Kong prisoners to be extradited to China, but the demonstrations have since extended to push back against Chinese influence and control in Hong Kong.\n\nSince being turned back over to Chinese control in 1997 after being a British colony, Hong Kong exists under \"one country, two systems\" that allows its citizens to have their own legal and legislative system and operate as a capitalistic region within communist China.\n\nIn China, the protests have operated as a challenge to Chinese sovereignty. Morey's tweet did the same, causing a rift between the NBA and China at a time when the league continues to grow in popularity in the region.\n\nThe Rockets, in particular, have been massively popular in the country since they drafted Yao Ming, the Hall of Fame Chinese center who played with the team for the entirety of his career. But the NBA now has deep business ties in the country in general, and the efforts of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to soothe over the tensions caused by Morey's tweet were met with backlash in the United States, with many calling out the league for kowtowing to Chinese censorship in an effort to protect its business ties.\n\nMorey has not been punished by the NBA or been fired from the Rockets\u2014and Silver has publicly asserted that Morey has the right to freely express his opinions\u2014but the league's image has undoubtedly taken a hit in the United States.

A person with knowledge of the situation said the Jazz player who tested positive was center Rudy Gobert. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the team confirmed the presumptive positive test.\"The NBA is suspending game play following the conclusion of tonight's schedule of games until further notice,\" the league said in a statement sent shortly after 9:30 p.m. EDT. \"The NBA will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.\"The test result, the NBA said, was reported shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for warmups and tip-off was moments away when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed \"due to unforeseen circumstances.\"Those circumstances were the league's worst-case scenario for now - a player testing positive. A second person who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity said the league expects the shutdown to last a minimum of two weeks, but cautioned that timeframe is very fluid.Players from teams the Jazz have played within the past 10 days are being told to self-quarantine, sources told ESPN's Brian Windhorst. Those teams are the Cleveland Cavaliers, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons and the Toronto Raptors.\"It's a very serious time right now,\" Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"I think the league moved appropriately and prudently and we'll all just have to monitor the situation and see where it goes from here.\"Spoelstra found out about the shutdown as he walked off the floor Wednesday night following his team's loss to Charlotte.For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, which declared a pandemic on Wednesday, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. In mainland China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.It has been a worldwide issue for several weeks. And now, it has hit the NBA.\"This is crazy,\" Cleveland forward Tristan Thompson said on Twitter.Charlotte Hornets coach James Borrego, speaking before his team's game at Miami, said \"these are scary times.\"Rapidly evolving times, as well. Around 7 p.m., a person with knowledge of the situation told AP that owners - who met by teleconference Wednesday - were largely in support of a plan to play games in empty arenas on a short-term basis.About an hour later, the Thunder-Jazz game was halted before tip-off. And about 90 minutes after that, the season was called off, effective when the last whistle was to blow Wednesday night.It is the latest major development in a season filled with unspeakably hard challenges. The league lost as much as $400 million in revenue after a rift with China was started in October when Houston general manager Daryl Morey tweeted out support of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. Former NBA Commissioner David Stern died in January, the same month that soon-to-be Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant died in a helicopter crash.And now, a pandemic - which could also cost the league hundreds of millions in lost revenue, depending on how long it lasts.\"As we've said from the beginning, the health and safety of our fans, employees, players and partners is our top priority and thus we fully support the NBA's decision to postpone games,\" Orlando Magic CEO Alex Martins said. \"We will continue to stay in contact with the league, and local, state and federal health experts as we closely monitor this public health crisis.\"The NBA's movement toward empty arenas in the short term came on the same day that the NCAA announced that the men's and women's Division I tournaments would be played without fans - except for a few family members - permitted inside to watch.\"People are clearly taking the measures that they feel they need to take for safety,\" said Heat guard Duncan Robinson, who played in both the Division I and Division III national championship games during his college days at Michigan and Williams.Robinson added, \"but at the same time the NBA has to protect its players in the league and the fans.\"Things were trending toward games in empty arenas for some time, and it was abundantly clear Wednesday morning when the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a Congressional committee that he would recommend the NBA not allow fans at games in response to the coronavirus.Dr. Anthony Fauci was responding to a question asked by Rep. Glenn Grothman, a Wisconsin Republican, \"is the NBA underreacting or is the Ivy League overreacting?\" Grothman was referencing how the Ivy League recently canceled its basketball tournaments, instead of having them without fans or keeping the status quo.\"We would recommend that there not be large crowds,\" Fauci said. \"If that means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, so be it. But as a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread.\"That was when the concern was about crowds and containment.By the close of business Wednesday in the NBA, the concern was so much more.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/07/10/740219700/fed-chairman-powell-hints-at-interest-rate-rate-cut-stocks-rally", "authors": ["Scott Horsley"], "title": "Fed Chairman Powell Hints At Interest Rate Cut; Stocks Rally", "text": "Fed Chairman Powell Hints At Interest Rate Cut; Stocks Rally\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nStocks rallied Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell testified about challenges the U.S. economy faces, adding to expectations that the central bank will cut interest rates later this month.\n\nThe Fed had hinted at such a cut in June.\n\nSince then, \"it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook,\" Powell said in prepared testimony for the House Financial Services Committee. \"Inflation pressures remain muted.\"\n\nStock indexes jumped by more than half a percentage point in the opening minutes of trading on the prospects that the Fed will cut rates for the first time since the Great Recession. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 150 points.\n\nPowell stressed that the U.S. economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace, as a record-long expansion begins its 11th year. But he cautioned that business investment has slowed, possibly as a response to ongoing trade tensions and a slowdown in the global economy.\n\nLast week, the Labor Department reported stronger-than-expected job growth in June.

If you can live by a few rules, you'll be able to survive, regardless of what happens in your future. The first rule is the simplest: Your income needs to add up to more than your spending.\n\nDire emergencies aside, you shouldn't be getting into debt for any reason if you're not earning a regular (and decent) salary. Credit cards offer the temptation of a spending spree, with the pain deferred for months (or even years) afterward, but don't you dare. That new purchase may seem exciting now, but you'll come to resent it when you're paying 20 percent interest on it.\n\nThird, set yourself a budget and do not, for any reason other than a serious emergency, break those rules. And no, Coachella tickets, illicit substances or a Seamless order to your dorm do not count as emergencies. With any purchase, channel Marie Kondo and ask if you need it or if you could do without or find a cheaper alternative.\n\nBudgeting 101\n\nSetting a budget can be hard, because it requires you to be mindful about how much you're regularly spending, and on what. The end result, however, is that you'll be able to understand where your cash goes and if you're making the best use of it. Use your budget as a way of learning where your weak points are, and set rules to combat that in the future.\n\nThe first thing to do is to work out how much cash you'll expect to have on hand for the year and what your fixed costs are. These are the things you'll pay on a regular basis, either week by week or month by month, for the duration of your education. You know what a fixed cost is, because you know that bad things happen if you stop paying it.\n\nThen, you'll want to make a list of your costs that, while not fixed, you'll be expected to pay on the regular. Food and drink, transport, not to mention fun, are all things you should keep in mind when building a budget. Plan how much you'd expect to spend in a good week and turn it into a fixed target, giving you a clear set of rules.\n\nIf you're struggling with this, remember that your spending must be less than your income. So if there's an imbalance, you'll need to find ways to cut your spending by eating less lavishly or taking cheaper forms of transport. And don't forget that you also need to account for emergencies and regular savings, so budget those in.\n\nOne more thing: You know those articles in which crusty rich people talk about how darn kids are spending too much money on store-bought coffee? It's world-class bull, because the dollars spent on drinking a $3 latte every day for a year wouldn't cover your loans, a car or down payment on a house. You need to include room in your budget for fun. Otherwise what's the point of living? Set a figure that you can afford, and spend it on whatever brings you joy.\n\nOUR FAVORITE WAYS TO BUDGET\n\nSpreadsheet\n\nThe cheapest thing you can do, of course, is plug your finances into a spreadsheet and do the rest manually. Spend half an hour in Google Sheets or Excel and you'll be able to knock out a half-decent budget that'll last years. I should know: The same spreadsheet I used as a student is still working well a decade later.\n\nObviously, it's far more work than some of the apps and services below, but there's something rewarding about doing it yourself. And if you're struggling to build your own, here's a sample Google spreadsheet you can experiment with yourself, when you've copied it to your own drive.\n\nYou Need a Budget\n\nPricing: $6.99 per month after an initial 34-day free trial, although the figure is taken as a $83.99 lump sum. The company says that if you aren't satisfied with the app or your service you can get a full refund, \"no questions asked.\"\n\nYou Need a Budget (YNAB) is one of the most popular money-management apps, and it's available for Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. It's based on Jesse Mecham's budgeting system, which gets you working your way out of debt through a combination of smart management and saving. Mecham's methods are, at first blush, unorthodox, but its users are often enthusiastic to the point of being evangelical.\n\nThat includes planning for expenses based on the cash in your bank rather than what you expect to have at the end of the month. And YNAB tasks you with \"aging\" your money, keeping the cash in your bank until it is more than 30 days old before spending it. If you can do that, it's likely your earnings are covering your spending and then some.\n\nThe platform offers goal tracking, education and a litany of workshops laid on every week to help people grapple with their budgets.\n\nSubscribe to YNAB - $7/month\n\nMint\n\nPricing: Mint is \"free\" because, like Facebook, you are the product that Mint can sell ads to, and the platform gets a commission from every financial product it sells you. A premium, but not ad-free, version, called Mint Credit Monitor, costs $17 per month, offering credit-score tracking and identify theft protection.\n\nMint is the budgeting website owned and operated by Intuit, the accounting-software giant that also owns TurboTax. The service can pull together your various bank and credit card accounts and track your spending and saving through a single page. You'll be able to develop your own budget and crucially, get reminders when it's time to pay your bills.\n\nMint may not have as much focus on clearing your debt as YNAB, but it does have one killer feature: It's owned by Intuit. That means come tax season (assuming your parents don't claim you for the credits), you can import your 1099 documents from Mint straight into TurboTax.\n\nSubscribe to Mint - $0+/month\n\nPocketGuard\n\nPricing: PocketGuard itself is free, but there are limits on what you can track (and you can't add in cash transactions at all). The unlocked product, PocketGuard Plus, costs $4 per month, or $20 annually.\n\nPocketGuard's selling point isn't that it aims to totally shift your financial habits but that it acts as an angel on your shoulder during the month. Once you've imported your accounts and categorized your spending, you can start adding things like spending limits. These are, unsurprisingly, ways in which you can limit yourself -- like only allocating $30 per month to entertainment and so forth. And PocketGuard is designed to look for cheaper alternatives to the financial products you already have.\n\nSubscribe to PocketGuard - $4/month\n\nClarity Money\n\nPricing: Clarity Money is free, and the company has said it will remain so even now that it's owned by Goldman Sachs. Over time, it's likely that Clarity will be integrated further into Marcus, Goldman's new online bank (of which it is now a part).\n\nThe idea behind Clarity is to put all of your banking into a single place so that you can organize your funds more easily. What separates Clarity from other apps is that it promises to help you save money by finding subscriptions you may have forgotten about, and it helps you cancel them. Even better, however, is the pledge to negotiate bills you've already incurred to try to get a better deal.\n\nSubscribe to Clarity Money - Free\n\nImage: David-Prado via Getty Images (Budgeting 101)", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.motor1.com/news/406678/rtr-mustang-spec-5-lebanon-ford/", "authors": ["Chris Okula"], "title": "RTR Celebrates 10th Anniversary With 750-Horsepower Mustang Spec 5", "text": "If you want to purchase a more powerful Mustang, you\u2019re spoiled for choice. Companies like Roush, Shelby, and even Ford have been offering more powerful Mustang options for decades. In 2010 a small company called RTR exploded on to the Mustang performance scene offering their unique take on a factory performance Mustang. Today RTR celebrates its tenth anniversary and has partnered with the team at Lebanannon Ford to offer the wildest road-going Mustangs you can buy from a dealership.\n\nRTR was founded by professional Formula D driver Vaughn Gitten Jr. who brings fun to Mustang performance. RTR stands for, \u201cready to rock\u201d, which means Vaughn\u2019s Mustangs are ready for anything. These high-performance Mustangs aren\u2019t focused on drifting or laying down lap times, although they are more than capable, instead, it\u2019s all about the driving experience.\n\nTo celebrate ten years of RTR, Vaugh partnered with Lebanon Ford to bring a limit run of ten RTR Spec 5\u2019s to a select group of buyers. RTR currently offers three levels of RTR Mustangs that you can purchase at dealerships across the country but the Spec 5 takes things to a new level.\n\nGallery: RTR Celebrates 10th Anniversary With 750-Horsepower Mustang Spec 5\n\n6 Photos\n\nIn the RTR performance hierarchy the RTR Spec 1 is all cosmetic enhancements, Spec 2 adds a complete suspension system to the Spec1\u2019s exterior treatments, and finally, the Spec 3 adds a Ford Performance supercharger good for 700 horsepower and 610 lb-ft of torque.\n\nThe Spec 5 builds on the RTR Spec 3 adding a Ford Performance Phase 2 Supercharger kit good for 750 horsepower. To cope with this additional power, RTR beefed up the drivetrain to handle the additional power reliably. On the exterior, the Spec 5 includes a widebody kit based on Vaugh\u2019s drift car which gives this Mustang an unmistakable presence.\n\nLebanon Ford will only build ten of these limited cars. To build your spec 5 be prepared to pay $50,000 on top of the price of your Mustang. This leads to pricing around $85,000 for a modestly equipped Mustang GT.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.salon.com/2019/06/24/did-the-saudis-urge-trump-to-call-off-planned-strike-against-iran/", "authors": [], "title": "Did the Saudis urge Trump to call off planned strike against Iran?", "text": "Saudi Arabia and Iran have long been bitter rivals for political and strategic dominance in the Gulf region. After President Trump called off retaliatory strikes against Iran at the last minute last Thursday night, one of his first calls to a foreign head of state was to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, also met with Saudi Arabia\u2019s deputy defense minister Prince Khalid bin Salman in Riyadh on Friday.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, said that she was not informed of Trump\u2019s plans to strike Iran on Thursday. The speaker, who is second in line to the presidency after Mike Pence, had been among the lawmakers gathered by Trump at the White House hours earlier to discuss what the administration called \"hostile behavior\" by Iranian forces.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTensions with Iran have been escalating since Trump announced his intention to pull out of the 2015 multinational nuclear agreement with Iran, and have dramatically ramped after the Iranians shot down a U.S. drone this week. Just as Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan announced his intention to leave the Pentagon, the military announced it was sending an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East, after announcing the deployment of 5,000 late last month.\n\nDemocrats have warned Trump not to take actions that could lead to the start of a war, but remain virtually powerless and left to make pleas to procedure and order, such as the ineffectual demand that an official declaration of war be voted by Congress.\n\n\"The Democrats in the meeting, House and Senate Democrats, were very clear that Congress must act \u2014 [that Trump] must have the authority of Congress \u2014 before we initiate military hostilities in Iran,\" Pelosi said before Trump ordered an overnight missile attack on Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, well-known war hawks in the president's inner circle, most notably national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have persistently pushed for military strikes against Iran.\n\n\"This administration has been going out of its way to try to provoke Iran to go to war,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee, told reporters on Friday. \"And I don't have a lot of confidence in the national security team that surrounds this president, and I certainly don't have any confidence in Donald Trump's ability to keep us out of war.\"\n\nPointless caviling aside, Senate Democrats were more successful at stopping another crucial foreign policy goal of the Trump administration this week.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAfter years of cajoling, Senate Democrats convinced enough Republicans to vote to block $8 billion worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The vote came on the same day that a British judge ruled that the government had broken the law by allowing arms sales to Saudi Arabia that might have been used in the bloody civil war in Yemen. Both U.S. and U.K. arms sales have significantly bolstered the Saudi air force's capability to carry out devastating air attacks in Yemen.\n\nEven with a few Republicans now on board to restrict future arms sales to Saudi Arabia, such sales will likely continue. The administration last month bypassed Congress on the Saudi deals by declaring an emergency. Thursday's vote fell far short of the two-thirds support needed to override an expected veto from Trump.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been an ally of U.S. interests in the Middle East since the 1950s, and the U.S. has been selling arms to Saudi Arabia that whole time. The kingdom has also been trying desperately to contain rising Iranian influence in the region. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said this week the kingdom wants to avoid war, but called for tougher sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cWe are consulting with our friends and allies to see what options and steps can be taken,\u201d Saudi foreign minister Adel Al-Jubeir said this week. \"Iran has to understand that its aggressive behavior cannot be sustained.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Trump administration has stuck by the Saudi regime even after last year's killing of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which nearly all observers believe was linked directly to Crown Prince Mohammed. Oil prices have surged as much as 10% amid rising tensions this week, and the White House said Trump and the prince discussed \"Saudi Arabia's critical role in ensuring stability in the Middle East and in the global oil market.\u201d The White House statement made no mention of Khashoggi\u2019s killing.\n\nAs the president haphazardly tweets \"we were cocked & loaded,\u201d it is clear that there is no way a Republican-controlled Senate will pass legislation that requires him to seek authorization for military conflict with Iran.\n\n\"Obviously, we're not going to get it done anytime soon, and he's going to veto it,\" Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a member of the Intelligence Committee, admitted. \"But I think it makes sense to send him a message,\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nDemocrats are pushing back against the Trump administration, the Republican Senate leadership and the Saudi monarchy \u2014 to little avail.

The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday, Dec. 9, 2020, that a Chinese coronavirus vaccine by Sinopharm tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86% effective, though it released few details. (AP Photo/Jon Gambrell, File)\n\nABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 The United Arab Emirates said Wednesday a Chinese coronavirus vaccine tested in the federation of sheikhdoms is 86% effective, in a statement that provided few details but marked the first public release of information on the efficacy of the shot.\n\nThe announcement brought yet another shot into the worldwide race for a vaccine to end the pandemic, a scientific effort that has seen China and Russia compete with Western firms for an effective inoculation. While questions remain about the Sinopharm shot, already at least one country outside China plans to roll it out in a mass-vaccination campaign.\n\nThe UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, conducted a trial beginning in September of the vaccine by Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical giant Sinopharm involving 31,000 volunteers from 125 nations. Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.\n\nThe UAE\u2019s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they \u201chave reviewed Sinopharm CNBG\u2019s interim analysis of the Phase III trials.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe analysis shows no serious safety concerns,\u201d the statement said, without detailing whether any participant suffered side effects.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving \u201cofficial registration\u201d without elaborating on what that meant.\n\nEmirati officials and Sinopharm did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.\n\nHowever, calls Wednesday to SEHA, the Abu Dhabi health authority, included an option for individuals to schedule an appointment to receive a \u201cCOVID-19 vaccine.\u201d The center was swamped with calls following the announcement on the vaccine\u2019s efficacy.\n\nThe Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious COVID-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80% of its adults in an operation starting this month that\u2019s relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.\n\nSinopharm\u2019s shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors, like the shot made by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus\u2019 spike protein using RNA. The United Kingdom already has begun vaccinating people with the Pfizer shot .\n\nTop officials in the UAE, including Dubai\u2019s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.\n\nAlready, Pfizer reports its shot as being 95% effective , while another RNA candidate from Moderna appears to be 94.5% effective. Results suggest a third vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca is safe and about 70% effective , but questions remain about how well it may help protect those over 55.\n\nIn transport, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must remain at cold temperatures \u2014 negative 70 degrees Celsius (negative 94 degree Fahrenheit) and negative 20 degrees Celsius (negative 4 degrees Fahrenheit), respectively.\n\nThe Sinopharm vaccine is believed to be able to travel at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (35 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), a major draw for areas of the world where nearly 3 billion people live without stable electricity and refrigeration . In November, the Communist Party secretary for Sinopharm said almost 1 million people in China had received its vaccine.\n\nFull Coverage: Coronavirus pandemic\n\nMeanwhile Wednesday, Abu Dhabi announced it would resume \u201call economic, tourism, cultural and entertainment activities in the emirate within two weeks.\u201d It attributed the decision to \u201csuccesses\u201d in halting the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAbu Dhabi has required those traveling into the emirate from the UAE\u2019s other six sheikhdoms to take a coronavirus test within 48 hours prior to arrival.\n\nSince the pandemic began, the UAE has detected over 178,000 cases of the virus, with 160,000 recoveries and nearly 600 deaths. Its aggressive testing policy has seen over 17 million tests conducted in a country home to just over 9 million people.\n\nIn Iran, meanwhile, President Hassan Rouhani angrily blamed U.S. sanctions for making it difficult for Tehran to purchase medicine and health supplies amid the pandemic .\n\nAnd in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the first shipment of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, calling it a \u201cbig day of celebration\u201d for the country.\n\n\u201cI believe in this vaccine. I expect it will receive the appropriate approval in the coming days,\u201d Netanyahu said, adding that he intended to be the first to receive it. \u201cWe see the end of the pandemic.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Huizhong Wu in Taipei, Taiwan; Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, and Ilan Ben Zion in Jerusalem contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans":

The Screen Recorder is the headline addition, making its way to the OnePlus 6/6T natively after it was first added to the OnePlus 7 Pro.\n\n[Update: 07/22]: Thanks to version 2.2 update of the OnePlus Screen Recorder, we are getting added Framerate settings for your recordings and an option to hide the floating widget that appears when recording (via Android Police).\n\nThe new settings now enable to you set your framerate for recordings to 15, 24, 30 or 60fps depending on your own preference. You won\u2019t find the OnePlus Screen Recorder in your app drawer, instead, to access these new settings you will have to press the small \u2018cog\u2019 icon that appears when you open the Screen Recorder overlay.\n\nWithout the floating on-screen widget, to stop recording, you will need to swipe down your notification shade and pause or stop recording via the notification.\n\nAP notes that they have tested on older OnePlus handsets such as the 5T, 6, 6T and it works well. While we expect a future OxygenOS OTA to add the settings very soon, you are able to download the separate .apk file and install manually if you are desperate to change your framerate and floating widget settings.\n\nSome of you reading may have already installed a standalone application that activated the feature on older OnePlus phones. This official port will no doubt result in smoother recording without any associated issues. The June 2019 patch comes alongside the new ability to screen record with some screen rotation tweaks on top.\n\nFor those in Denmark, you now have support for VoLTE on the Telia network. One more thing to note is that the feedback tool is now integrated within the community app \u2014 which was added to recent Open Beta builds of OxygenOS.\n\nWe have had our feedback tool integrated into community app under testing in Open Betas for a while now, and it\u2019s time for the Feedback tool to be part of our stable builds. You can now submit bug reports, product suggestions, and feature requests seamlessly from the community app and the best part is that it automatically captures the required logs based on the issue you are reporting, thus making it easier for our team to address issues and track feedback.\n\nOxygenOS 9.0.15 and 9.0.7 for OnePlus 6/6T changelog\n\nSystem Updated Android security patch to 2019.6 Improved screen rotation Added Screen recorder feature (Quick Settings \u2013 Screen Recorder)\n\nCommunication Support VoLTE/VoWiFi for Telia Denmark\n\n\n\nOn the OnePlus 6, the OxygenOS 9.0.7 update weighs in at around 311MB and both OTAs should be rolling out now incrementally.

The site \u2014 once a huge Sears warehouse turned into office space \u2014 is one of several buildings in the Fenway that are being repositioned to house drug makers, research labs, and other health care-related companies that want to be near the booming Longwood Medical Area.\n\nThe region\u2019s biggest life science real estate developer is making a major move into the Fenway, the latest sign of the region\u2019s hot market for lab space.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe property was bought in 2011 by prominent Fenway developer Samuels & Associates, with financial backing from an arm of JP Morgan, for $530 million. It overhauled much of the ground-floor retail space \u2014 bringing in a Time Out Market food hall and Trillium beer garden \u2014 and turned a surface lot into a park along the Emerald Necklace. It\u2019s also at work on a 510,000-square-foot office and lab building, at 201 Brookline Ave., which is set to open in 2022. That will give the complex about 1.8 million square feet of space in all.\n\nSamuels will remain a partner and continue to manage the property and oversee future phases of development \u2014 another corner of the site is permitted for a 400,000-square-foot office building \u2014 with Alexandria essentially replacing JP Morgan as its financial backer. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman said that the deal reflected the progress it\u2019s made in turning a once-forlorn corner of the Fenway into a lively hub of activity.\n\n\u201cThe historic 401 Park building has been a groundbreaking Boston icon in the way it balances dynamic, innovative commercial tenants with an active set of retail, dining, and community spaces that offer an unmatched civic experience,\u201d said Samuels spokeswoman Diana Pisciotta. \u201cWe are pleased with Alexandria\u2019s vote of confidence.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Alexandria \u2014 a California-based life science real estate giant that has been a major developer in Kendall Square for 20 years \u2014 it\u2019s the latest in a string of investments in Greater Boston. Over the last 18 months, the real estate company has purchased \u2014 and in some cases received permits for \u2014 several projects. They include sites for lab and life science office projects in Waltham, Watertown, and the Fort Point section of South Boston, where \u2014 with partner National Development \u2014 it\u2019s taken over the Necco Street site where General Electric once planned to build its world headquarters.\n\nAlexandria declined comment on the deal, beyond filings made Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The publicly traded real estate trust is issuing stock to fund the deal, which is expected to close in the next few months.\n\nAlexandria\u2019s buying-and-building spree is part of a trend of life science development spreading out in and around Boston, as drug makers and researchers look for room to grow beyond crowded and costly Kendall Square in Cambridge. Several projects in the Seaport District have lately drawn investment from life science companies \u2014 including Biomed Realty\u2019s purchase of the former John Hancock headquarters building at 601 Congress St., which was announced Wednesday. Meantime, developers in neighborhoods ranging from East Somerville to Allston to Columbia Point also are angling to capitalize on the growth of the life science sector.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Fenway, not far from Longwood, is well-positioned for that as well, real estate experts say.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t really been a traditional lab market before. It\u2019s always been sort of between downtown and Longwood,\u201d said Liz Berthelette, research director at real estate firm Newmark. \u201cBut it\u2019s starting to emerge as a viable option for commercial labs, and probably has some legs.\u201d\n\nSeveral life science firms have moved into other office buildings owned by Samuels along Boylston Street, while newly-formed life science builder IQHQ is getting ready to break ground on the long-planned Fenway Center project, which would put a $1 billion tower aimed at life science tenants atop the Massachusetts Turnpike.\n\nNow, Alexandria, which already has deep relationships with drug makers and tech firms and operates more than 8 million square feet in office and lab space in the Boston area, is coming to the neighborhood as well.\n\nTim Logan can be reached at timothy.logan@globe.com.

With the coronavirus pandemic, massive turnout, and Trump\u2019s assaults on mailed ballots threatening to complicate the vote count, the Democratic curing effort has ramped up in size and scale. It\u2019s a case of every vote counting, literally.\n\n\u201cWe have always done cure work, but most years it starts later in the election cycle,\u201d said Josh Geise, a Democratic consultant and Florida director for America Votes, a non-profit that is running one of the state\u2019s largest vote-by-mail cure efforts. \u201cWe have started earlier than we ever have before, calling, texting, and sending mail telling people what they need to do to fix their ballots.\u201d\n\nAs of Monday morning, nearly 3.8 million mail ballots had been cast in Florida, of which 15,574 had been rejected, a rate of 0.4 percent.\n\nOf those, 7,100 were sent by Democrats, 3,975 from Republicans, and 4,495 from voters with no major party affiliation, a group that will play a large role in deciding who wins Florida.\n\nSo far, 7,531 rejected ballots have been cured, of which 3,768 were cast by Democrats, 1,919 by Republicans, and 1,826 by voters unaffiliated with either party, according to Geise.\n\nBallot cure operations are a priority for Democrats this year, but Republicans, too, are focused on the process. The Republican Party of Florida\u2019s Our Secure Ballots operation is \u201crobust and sophisticated and allows us to actively contact voters,\u201d RPOF spokesperson Alia Faraj-Johnson said.\n\nThe numbers might seem insignificant, but statewide races in Florida have been decided by roughly one percentage point in each of the past two election cycles. Trump won Florida in 2016 by fewer than 113,000 votes out of nearly 9.5 million ballots cast.\n\nAnd this year\u2019s massive use of vote-by-mail creates potential for a larger number of ballots to be uncounted because of errors. Ballots frequently are rejected, for example, because signatures are missing or do not match those on file with local election officials.\n\n\u201cIt would be an awful thing for anyone\u2019s vote to not count because of a paperwork or signature error and not because of anything nefarious,\u201d Jenne said.\n\nThe Biden campaign is focused on educating voters to limit mistakes on the front end.\n\nRepublicans helped establish Florida\u2019s vote-by-mail system and over the past two decades have dominated the mail vote. That advantage was upended this year as Trump tore down the institution as a tool for voter fraud.\n\nTrump\u2019s messaging has many Republicans opting to vote in person. Democrats have cast 1.8 million mail votes, a more than 613,000-vote advantage, while Republicans have cast 1.1 million votes via in-person early voting, a 290,384 advantage over Democrats, according to Florida Department of State data.\n\nUniversity of Florida political scientist Dan Smith said the fight for Florida will, \u201cwithout question, be an all-out fight to the very end.\u201d\n\nYounger voters, those between the ages of 18 and 23, are being rejected at a rate of 1.2 percent, Smith said, far higher than the overall 0.4 percent rejection rate. In 2016, the last presidential election cycle, 1 percent of vote-by-mail ballots were rejected. In the 2018 midterms, that number that was 1.2 percent.\n\nYounger voters, who lean Democratic, are at greater risk of having their ballots uncured, Smith said, because he has found they are more likely to respond with anger and confusion about why their ballot did not count in the first place.\n\n\u201cPhysiologically for younger voters and those voting for the first time are doing so because they are done with the campaign season and do not want to think about it anymore,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen these groups contact them about not accepting their ballot, there can be a kind of \u2018I\u2019m not going to do it again\u2019 anger with the system.\u201d\n\nSo far in the general election, the ballot rejection rate has been relatively low. During Florida\u2019s August primary, 35,000 mail ballots were rejected, or about 1.5 percent of the total votes cast. Nearly 66 percent of ballots rejected during the primary arrived after the deadline of 7 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nSmith thinks the rate will climb when late ballots come in after Election Day.\n\n\u201cHistorically, about 60 percent of rejected ballots come in late,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg in terms of those rejected.\u201d", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26754131/cubs-zobrist-remains-leave-amid-divorce", "authors": ["Alden Gonzalez"], "title": "Cubs' Zobrist remains on leave amid divorce", "text": "Cubs veteran Ben Zobrist remains on a personal leave of absence from the team, and court documents filed in Chicago indicate he is getting divorced.\n\nAccording to the documents, his wife, Julianna, is listed as the plaintiff.

It's difficult for any rivals to catch Tesla on range and efficiency since its cars are continually updated. Recently, the Model S sedan and Model X crossover both underwent a powertrain reconfiguration, which is referred to as the 'Raven.'\n\nAccording to the EPA, the all-wheel-drive Tesla Model S Long Range 'Raven' has a range of 391 miles (630 km). However, Tesla says its range was recently increased to 400 miles (644 km), though the EPA's test doesn't prove that. CEO Elon Musk called the test faulty and said Tesla has logs to prove its 400-mile range is correct.\n\nBj\u00f8rn Nyland sets out to see if the Model S Raven can achieve at least 600 km of range in his typical real-world range test. He clarifies that he already did such a test in the Model S Performance Raven with 21-inch wheels. However, in this recent test, he's driving the latest Long Range model with stock 19s and Michelin Pilot Sport 4 tires.\n\nWe don't want to spoil the fun too much here, but it's safe to say the Model S Long Range Raven beats the EPA's 391-mile range estimate.

Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor was made widely available in Wear OS smartwatches (with mediocre results), Samsung continued its Galaxy Watch lineup with the Galaxy Watch Active 2, and Fitbit's offering of fitness trackers and smartwatches saw some great additions. We were treated to some excellent wearables in 2019, but all of them were really just subtle updates to existing gadgets. That's not to say 2019 was a bad year for wearables, but it certainly wasn't the most exciting we've ever had.\n\n2020 is shaping up to be a very similar year, though new tech from Qualcomm and Google's Fitbit acquisition could allow for some big developments. Without further ado, here's what we're looking forward to in wearables for 2020. Get two Samsung Galaxy S10 for the price of one! Improvements to processing speed and battery life\n\nEvery year, new technology allows our devices to run faster and last longer. 2019's wearables saw that, with Fitbit adding an extra day of battery life to the Versa 2 compared to the original Versa, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 3100 processor making a big claim for longer battery life. Once again for 2020, we should see similar improvements in these areas. It's difficult to say exactly how significant these improvements will be, but simply due to the nature of how technology advances, our tiny wrist computers released in the new year should get more powerful and be able to last a little bit longer in between charges. A new Snapdragon processor for Wear OS\n\nDetails on next-gen wearable chipsets remain mostly unclear, but we have heard some talk regarding Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon Wear 3300 wearable processor. Previous Qualcomm processors, including the Snapdragon Wear 3100 that was used in 2019, have been built on an outdated 28nm platform. With the rumored 3300, however, it'll use a much more efficient 12nm one. That may not sound like much on paper, but it should result in substantially faster performance and longer battery life. Qualcomm has yet to make any official comment on the existence of the Wear 3300, but considering how disappointing the 3100 turned out to be, we're all for another chipset to make Wear OS less of a dumpster fire than it currently is. Wear OS as a platform has a ton of potential, but lackluster processors that result in laggy performance and day-long batteries has put a damper on just about every Wear OS watch that comes out. If Qualcomm can build a chipset that delivers meaningful upgrades in these areas, 2020 could be the year that Wear OS comes out of the rut it's been in for so long. Continued focus on health/fitness tracking\n\nOver the last couple of years, there's been one core feature set that all smartwatch makers have been eager to tackle \u2014 health and fitness tracking. In 2020, it's very likely that this focus will remain for yet another year.\n\nFitbit is the market leader for wearables in these regards, offering unmatched fitness tracking, powerful sleep monitoring (something even the Apple Watch doesn't offer), and access to the new Fitbit Premium membership that was rolled out towards the end of 2019. Now that Google has plans to purchase Fitbit for $2.1 billion, it'll be interesting to see how this acquisition affects Fitbit's own wearable lineup and future Wear OS devices. Will Fitbit wearables continue to exist as they do now? Will Google integrate the Fitbit platform and tracking tools into a future Wear OS watch of its own? Whatever happens, bringing health and fitness tools to as many people as possible will be at the forefront. Samsung also proved to be a big proponent of health tracking in 2019, with the Galaxy Watch Active 2 offering a robust set of tools and features to help people live healthier lives \u2014 something we're bound to see more of in 2020. Google Pixel Watch?\n\nEvery year, there's talk of Google creating its own smartwatch under the Pixel brand used for its smartphones and Chromebooks. Rumors and leaks pop up regarding a Pixel Watch, we get excited about the idea of a Google-made wearable, and then nothing happens. I find it hard to believe that Google will never create its own smartwatch, and with the Fitbit deal expecting to be completed at some point in 2020, it seems more likely than ever that a Pixel Watch could be in our near future. A report from September 2019 revealed that Google was planning on making a Pixel Watch back in 2016, but ultimately scrapped the project due to performance and syncing issues. I do think our chances of getting a Pixel Watch in 2020 are stronger than they were in 2019, but I wouldn't start holding my breath for one this early on. The Fitbit deal is still in the early stages, and assuming this is the catalyst Google has been waiting on to make a Pixel smartwatch, we could be waiting until 2021 to see tangible results of the purchase.\n\nSleek and stylish Fossil Gen 5 Smartwatch One of the best Wear OS watches you can buy If you're in the market for a Wear OS smartwatch, the one we recommend picking up is the Fossil Gen 5. It's lightweight and comfortable to wear, has great performance, and NFC and GPS chips for enhanced features. We also love the external speaker that's used for taking calls and talking to the Google Assistant.

Back in February, Microsoft invited select Insiders to start testing the 20H1 update that will ship in the first half of 2020, and the whole Spring passed the company giving any information about 19H2, the next Windows 10 update that will precede 20H1.\n\nEven though the software giant has yet to say it explicitly, it seems that the company is ready to move to one major Windows 10 update in the Spring, followed by a minor update in the Fall. And it seems that traces of what could end up being 21H1, the major Windows 10 update to be released in the first half of 2021 can already be found in the wild.\n\nWindows 10 build 19480 sighting\n\nItalian blog Aggiornamenti Lumia is reporting today that the Windows 10 build 19480 and newer are mentioned in languages packs available on the Microsoft Store. 19480 represents quite a big jump from the 19H1 build 18985 that Microsoft released for Fast Ring Insiders yesterday.\n\nIs Sets returning?\n\nWalkingCat, the Microsoft leaker with pretty good track record added a bit more grain to the rumor mill today by hinting that Windows Sets could come back in these advanced builds that could already be tested internally. As a reminder, Windows Sets was a feature that would have allowed Windows 10 users to group together apps, browsers tabs and more in a single window using a tabbed interface.\n\noh ? \"Sets\" is back in 19481 ? \ud83e\uddd0\n\nThe Redmond giant removed Windows Sets from 19H1 preview builds last year, and Microsoft\u2019s Joe Belfiore later said at Build 2018 that the feature would come back \u201cwhen we think it\u2019s great.\" We wouldn't blame you if you had forgotten about the feature in the meantime, and it would be surprising to see Microsoft bring it back. Recent big new Windows 10 features such Cortana, Paint 3D, My People, or Timeline don't seem to have really resonated with users, and the previous version of Windows Sets that we saw in preview 19H1 builds wasn't really intuitive, even though it got some love from power users.\n\nMicrosoft's upcoming Surface event in New York City is right around the corner, and even though hardware should be the main focus, we could well hear more about the future of Windows 10 during the event. The company could also use the event to announce a release date for Windows 10 version 1909 (19H2), as it did last year for the October 2018 Update.\n\nShare This\n\nFurther reading: Windows 10", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Fri Sep 20 09:08:39 +0000 2019", "id": 1174973635515142145, "id_str": "1174973635515142145", "full_text": "oh ? \"Sets\" is back in 19481 ? \ud83e\uddd0", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 32], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": []}, "source": "<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 617885926, "id_str": "617885926", "name": "WalkingCat", "screen_name": "h0x0d", "location": "by the riverside", "description": "the cat walking in the night", "url": "https://t.co/d3MBg0YxZL", "entities": {"url": {"urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/d3MBg0YxZL", "expanded_url": "https://github.com/WalkingCat", "display_url": "github.com/WalkingCat", "indices": [0, 23]}]}, "description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 15953, "friends_count": 114, "listed_count": 325, "created_at": "Mon Jun 25 07:46:22 +0000 2012", "favourites_count": 216, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": false, "verified": false, "statuses_count": 12266, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": true, "profile_background_color": "642D8B", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme10/bg.gif", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme10/bg.gif", "profile_background_tile": true, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2346386083/nry1cnewlr20qyfy79ei_normal.png", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/2346386083/nry1cnewlr20qyfy79ei_normal.png", "profile_link_color": "0000FF", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "FFFFFF", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "7AC3EE", "profile_text_color": "3D1957", "profile_use_background_image": true, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": false, "default_profile_image": false, "following": null, "follow_request_sent": null, "notifications": null, "translator_type": "none"}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 10, "favorite_count": 82, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "lang": "en"}], "spans": [[1417, 1449]]}, {"url": "http://social.techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/why-is-one-medical-worth-more-than-casper/", "authors": [], "title": "Why is One Medical worth more than Casper? \u2013 TechCrunch", "text": "Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch\u2019s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.\n\nThis week was something fun.

The homer was the 27th for Braun \u2013 most ever by a visiting player \u2013 in his 97th game at Great American Ball Park.\n\nThe Brewers then grabbed their first lead in the third by playing small ball \u2013 something they've done with greater success during their September surge.\n\nCLOSE Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell breaks down his team\u2019s incredible September success.

Grisham walked and Yasmani Grandal doubled to right to drive in Arcia.\n\nMike Moustakas followed with a walk to load the bases and Keston Hiura's sacrifice fly to right plated Grisham, making it a 3-2 game and giving the Brewers two more runs than they'd scored against Gray in his previous 14 innings against them.\n\nHouser, meanwhile, settled in and retired 10 of the final 11 batters he faced before being lifted for pinch-hitter David Freitas to lead off the fifth \u2013 and that baserunner reached to open the third courtesy an Arcia throwing error.\n\nGray (11-8) retired the final eight hitters he faced before departing after the fifth, closing the book on the evening's starters.\n\nSuter took over for Houser and continued his superlative work out of the bullpen.\n\nAfter striking out a pair in a 1-2-3 fifth, he worked around a Votto single and Eugenio Su\u00e1rez walk to start the sixth by getting Aquino to ground into a 5-3 double play and striking out Curt Casali.\n\nThe Reds put a pair of baserunners on in the seventh as well after Alex Blandino and Jos\u00e9 Peraza singled with one out.\n\nBut Suter (4-0) got Kyle Farmer to pop out and Phillip Ervin to fly out, with Lorenzo Cain making a tremendous running grab in right-center.\n\n\"I had to turn it on a little bit,\" said Cain. \"I\u2019m not feeling as well as I want to out there, but it\u2019s good enough right now. I\u2019m definitely grinding out there, but I feel like I need to be out there on the field.\n\n\"I\u2019m trying to make a play to help our pitching.

But his throw was wild and actually hit first-base coach Carlos Subero, allowing Thames to score from third.\n\nThe Reds brought the potential winning run to the plate in the ninth after a pair of two-out hits, but Hader struck out Kyle Farmer to record his 36th save.\n\n\"Farmer fouled off a couple of pitches and he got the right spot, and (Hader) threw a really good one,\" Counsell said. \"That\u2019s what Josh is doing now. That slider is a weapon. The hitter has to be prepared for it.\n\n\"It\u2019s really tough to hit both pitches.\"\n\nThe Brewers' next -- and best shot -- in the series to clinch their postseason spot comes Wednesday, with 2-11 Tyler Mahle starting for the Reds. Thursday brings all-star righty Luis Castillo for the finale.\n\n\"Everybody stepped up in a big way -- offense, pitching and defense,\" Cain said. \"Everybody has been playing well. My guy Brauny is coming up with big hits all the time. That\u2019s what he does. It\u2019s been a total team effort.\n\n\"Those are the games you need down the stretch to get where you want to be \u2013 and that\u2019s the playoffs. It\u2019s looking good right now, but we have to show up and do it again tomorrow.\"\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nOn the board: Freitas led all the minor leagues in hitting at Class AAA San Antonio this season, but it took him 14 plate appearances since his Sept. 1 call-up to register his first knock with the Brewers \u2013 a solid single to right Sunday against the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nFreitas has also walked three times and scored a run as he continues to fill a role as one of manager Craig Counsell's first pinch-hitters off the bench.\n\n\"Pinch-hitting is something that's definitely new to me,\" said Freitas, who played one game at the start of the season with the Seattle Mariners before being traded to the Brewers. He struck out hitting for Houser to start the fifth Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm kind of just going with the flow of what's going on and trying to figure out maybe when I'm going in there or not. I'm just waiting for my name to be called. When I got the hit, it felt better to get a hit than not.\"\n\nPerfect timing: The Brewers traveled to Cincinnati Monday night but otherwise enjoyed their final off day of the regular season. They'd played 18 straight games to that point, going 15-3 to get themselves to the cusp of a wild-card berth.\n\n\"I think it was the right time for it, for sure,\" Counsell said. \"The weekend went really well as far as how we managed our bullpen. But as far as our position guys like Moose and Lorenzo, they needed it for sure. Now, we\u2019re ready to get back at it for six huge games.\"\n\nHold that thought: Counsell said he hasn't had any discussions with president of baseball operations David Stearns about whether the Brewers would begin lining up their pitching for the postseason.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time to think about that,\" he said. \"I think there\u2019s a lot of work left to do. It\u2019s pretty far from my mind, frankly, and it\u2019s not a five-day project.

1", "text": "San Francisco (CNN Business) Come Friday, many low-wage workers across the US are getting a pay bump.\n\nTwenty states are raising their minimum wage rates \u2014 some by pennies, others by a dollar or more \u2014 as part of previously-scheduled efforts to adjust for cost-of-living gains or to ratchet up toward goals like $15-an-hour minimum pay.\n\nIn New Mexico, the minimum wage will increase to $10.50, up $1.50 from the current $9 wage. And in California, the rate for employers with 26 workers or more will rise from $13 to $14 an hour, the highest state-wide baseline in the country. In Minnesota, the gain is just 8 cents, to a $10.08 hourly rate for large employers. (Scroll down to see a full list of the changes).\n\nThe federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour hasn't budged since 2009, and as of 2021, 20 US states will continue to have a minimum wage either equal to or below the federal level, making that their default baseline. The value of the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968 when it was $1.60, which would be worth about $12 in 2020 dollars\n\nAlthough some of the new state increases were set in place years before, they carry additional significance now, when low-wage workers have been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"We have lots of low-wage, service workers who are working through the Covid crisis, many of whom are in jobs with a greater risk of transmission,\" said Ken Jacobs, chair of the Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California-Berkeley. \"This will be a very welcome boost for them. As well, a lot of families are struggling right now in this crisis.\"\n\nWorkers' needs are greater during an economic downturn because, with so many people jobless, they have little bargaining power and employers are able to keep wages low, said Ben Zipperer, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a progressive think tank.\n\nBusiness interests push back\n\nAt the same time, some legislators and business organizations have called for a pause on scheduled minimum wage hikes, citing the burden on small businesses that are already struggling.\n\nIn New York, members of the state Senate Republican Conference had urged Governor Andrew Cuomo to stop the planned increases slated to go into effect Thursday.\n\n\"We do not want our small businesses to make the difficult choice of laying off workers or closing their doors because this becomes the final straw during the financial fragility of the pandemic,\" Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt said in a statement in early December.\n\nCuomo's administration later released a report concluding that the state's labor market recovery is \"not likely to be substantially harmed\" by the minimum wage increases, and rather the pace and distribution of vaccines likely will have a far greater effect on the job market.\n\n\"New York is implementing the minimum wage gradually over many years, not all in one fell swoop,\" Evercore ISI economist Ernie Tedeschi told CNN Business via email. \"Moreover, and this is the most important point, the schedule for New York's minimum wage increases has been known for years now, and businesses have been planning for and expecting the hikes this whole time.\"\n\nStarting Thursday, the minimum hourly wage in the state will increase 70 cents to $12.50 an hour. The minimum wage rates in suburban Long Island and Westchester County will also rise to $14 per hour from $13 an hour. (The minimum was already set at $15 in New York City).\n\nSome states will have to wait\n\nIn Michigan, the pandemic likely will scuttle efforts to increase the state minimum wage. There, a state law prohibits scheduled minimum wage increases when the state's annual unemployment rate is above 8.5%.\n\nwill drop below the 8.5% threshold, the state's Bureau of Employment Relations The state's minimum wage will stay at $9.65 versus rising to $9.87. Although the jobless rate has recently improved in Michigan, it averaged 10.2% from January through October, so it's \"highly unlikely\" the annual averagewill drop below the 8.5% threshold,the state's Bureau of Employment Relations said in a press release The state's minimum wage will stay at $9.65 versus rising to $9.87.\n\nFor the 20 states that will raise their minimum wages, the effects ultimately should be more positive than negative, the EPI's Zipperer said.\n\n\"Redistributing money towards the lowest paid workers is smart policy, because they will spend it,\" he said. \"This will help the shortfall in consumer demand our economy faces right now.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.profootballrumors.com/2020/12/jets-fire-dc-gregg-williams", "authors": [], "title": "Jets Fire DC Gregg Williams", "text": "The Jets have fired defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, according to NFL.com\u2019s Tom Pelissero (on Twitter). The move comes after the Jets latest loss to the Raiders, dropping them to 0-12.\n\n[RELATED: Jets Eyeing Eagles HC Doug Pederson?]\n\nFans have mostly directed their ire towards head coach Adam Gase this year, but, so far, the Jets have resisted calls for his firing. For now, Williams is the lone coach to get the heave-ho, but no one would be surprised to see additional house cleaning between now and the end of the year. It\u2019s worth noting that the Jets also employ Williams\u2019 son \u2014 Blake Williams \u2014 as a defensive assistant.\n\nWilliams has built a career as a defensive guru, but his Jets unit ranked 29th in the NFL this year. The last straw might have come on Sunday when he called an all-out blitz on the final play, leaving one outmatched cornerback to guard Henry Ruggs III. Ruggs burned him and scored a 46-yard touchdown, costing the Jets their first W of the season.\n\nIn Williams\u2019 defense, this Jets team was clearly not built to win. That was clear when the Jets shipped safety Jamal Adams to the Seahawks and later sent linebacker Avery Williamson to the Steelers. They\u2019ve also been sans C.J.

WarnerMedia has extended their deal for AEW: DYNAMITE, a top 20 new cable unscripted series, through 2023. In addition, the parties have agreed to launch another night of AEW action, offering more of the fans\u2019 favorite wrestlers, with a second show straight-to- series.\n\n\u201cWhen Tony Khan first shared with me his idea of starting a new wrestling league, I was impressed by his audacity to go up against a contender that has been the only game in town for twenty years, and ultimately believed that together we could bring his vision for a new, authentic, gritty product to bear,\u201d says Kevin Reilly, chief content officer, HBO Max, president, TNT, TBS, and truTV. \u201cThe fans have spoken and after only three months, we have seen AEW shake up the wrestling world and this will only continue as we build upon this momentum.\u201d\n\nAEW: DYNAMITE exploded onto the wrestling scene when it premiered on TNT as the night\u2019s #1 wrestling show. It has continued to deliver high performing episodes each week with the series averaging 1.2M total viewers and 654K A18-49 per episode in Live +7 Day viewing. In only three months, AEW: DYNAMITE has reached nearly 32 million people across all platforms. The show also delivers the youngest wrestling audience on television.\n\n\u201cWhen we launched AEW one year ago, we wanted to start a revolution that would disrupt the wrestling business, but everyone said that it would take a strong weekly television partner to make AEW real in the eyes of everyone \u2013 above all, the fans,\u201d said Tony Khan, president and CEO of AEW. \u201cWhat virtually no one realized at the time was Kevin Reilly and TNT were committed to this very same movement from Day One, and their belief in us made it possible for AEW to think and act big from the start. Here we are, only three months into Wednesday Night Dynamite, and now we\u2019ve been extended through 2023! We\u2019re now making the ultimate statement that the team of AEW and TNT is here to stay and to bring fans more of the great wrestling that the fans demand and deserve.\u201d\n\nWeekly action-packed matches continue to air live on Wednesdays from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. ET as part of TNT\u2019s line-up of big, lean-forward television that gives viewers the best seat in the house for electrifying stories, dynamic characters and thrilling events. A global franchise, AEW has already secured broadcast deals in the UK, Canada, France and Germany and is available in over 100 other countries through the AEWPlus.com subscription service. Both parties are continuously exploring ways to further expand this relationship.\n\nWarnerMedia announced in May 2019 that it was working with AEW by utilizing its position as a next- generation global media company to help build this league into a global pro-wrestling franchise. WarnerMedia has also been offering fans exclusive access to AEW\u2019s extremely popular pay-per-view matches, which kicked off in May 2019, via B/R Live. Their next event, REVOLUTION, which takes place in Chicago on Saturday, Feb. 29, will also stream on the platform. With nearly 100,000 total AEW pay-per- view buys, B/R Live\u2019s high fan engagement provides an invaluable opportunity to build AEW\u2019s audience and maximize its viewership.\n\nIn addition to being a ratings success, AEW has earned a great deal of praise from a wide range of press. Newsweek called it \u201dOne of the best shows of 2019,\u201d and four of AEW\u2019s wrestlers were named in Sports Illustrated\u2019s Top 10 wrestlers of 2019, with Jon Moxley being named \u201cWrestler of the Year.\u201d The Washington Post also wrote that \u201cAEW\u2026 is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to present pro wrestling differently, with a focus on diversity and inclusion in the ring, in the front office and in the audience.\u201d USA Today referred to the league as the \u201cnew cool kids,\u201d and the New York Post stated that AEW: DYNAMITE \u201cshowcased the superb in-ring action it\u2019s known for.\u201d Complex heralded AEW: DYNAMITE\u2019s presentation as \u201ctop notch\u201d and /Film wrote that \u201cAEW is the best and most refreshing professional wrestling has been in years.\u201d\n\nAEW is a new global wrestling league that features a world-class roster of diverse male and female wrestlers, giving fans a new wrestling experience for the first time in 20 years. AEW is about more than wrestling. It\u2019s a movement fueled by fans. Focused on fast-paced, high-impact competitions, AEW offers fans more athleticism along with real sports analytics.

While she and her sisters have gotten pickier and more strategic about who they partner with and endorse in recent times, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Thinking that their fifteen minutes of fame would eventually run out, they partnered with any and everyone to make sure they could line their pockets with as much money as possible.\n\nKim Kardashian West | Photo by Presley Ann/Getty Images for American Influencer Awards\n\nThough Kardashian West knew that she wielded no small amount of influence, she underestimated just how powerful her endorsement was for several years. In a recent interview with The Cut, Kardashian West reminisced on the exact moment when she felt the power of her endorsement with a little help from her momager, Kris Jenner. \u201cMy mom might know if you want me to call her just to get you a really specific thing. Don\u2019t write, like, \u2018She had to call her mom.\u2019 I mean \u2026 You could, it\u2019s funny, but \u2014,\u201d Kardashian West said playfully.\n\nMomager, Kris Jenner, to the rescue\n\nThe 39-year-old did, in fact, call her mother in order to answer the question as honestly as possible. \u201cWas there a specific moment when I realized that I was worthy of an endorsement?\u201d she asked of the momager. She then made reference to her little sister, billionaire, Kylie Jenner. \u201cLike, it would blow up if I said I liked it. Kind of like when Kylie said, \u2018Snapchat sucks.\u2019 And then it tanked. I would honestly maybe say Dubai at the milkshake thing,\u201d the KKW Fragrance owner stated. She went back and forth with her mom a bit more before she landed on the story of the milkshakes.\n\nWhen Kim K realized how powerful her endorsement was\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019d say 2010, 2011 was like, \u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201d Cupcakes, milkshakes. So I go to a milkshake place in Dubai, thinking, Oh, it\u2019s just, you know, some little milkshake store. Maybe like 250,000 people showed up to the Dubai mall,\u201d the SKIMS owner recalled. Of course, that statement was wildly hyperbolic. The National reported than only 3.000 actually showed up, rather than 250,000. Nevertheless, it was still a huge crowd who showed up off of the sheer strength of Kardashian West\u2019s word.\n\nKim Kardashian West was shocked by the milkshake place\n\nKardashian West recalls being floored by just how many people were there to support something that she\u2019d given her stamp of approval to. Even her manager, Jenner, was taken aback by just how powerful her endorsement had become. \u201cI had never seen anything like it before. We had to sneak out the back. I mean, I took videos of the thousands, hundreds of thousands of people at the mall in Dubai. My mom and I looked at each other \u2014 because I made her come with me \u2014 and we were like, \u201cHoly s*it. What is going on? A milkshake place?\u201d Kardashian West recalled.\n\nInstagram influence\n\nA lot has changed since the early 2010s These days all the KarJenners know just how powerful their influence and endorsements are. They are offered hundreds of thousands of dollars just to promote brands and products in a simple Instagram post. Kardashian West is especially strategic about who and what she supports. She\u2019s certainly come a long way since promoting foreign milkshakes.

Yet you don\u2019t see the other side of the equation: the number of deaths resulting from the lockdowns imposed ostensibly to fight the coronavirus.\n\nMore and more medical professionals are recognizing the severe damage the lockdowns have caused to present and future public health. A worldwide collection of medical and public health experts has just issued a declaration stating that current \u201clockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health\u201d and that to keep \u201cthese measures in place until a vaccine is available will cause irreparable damage, with the underprivileged disproportionately harmed.\u201d\n\nThis Great Barrington Declaration argues that public health policy should instead focus on protecting vulnerable parts of the population, such as the elderly and infirm while allowing the rest of the public to return to normal life to build up herd immunity. Within a few days, almost 32,000 medical and public health professionals had signed the declaration.\n\nIts authors\u2019 argument is reinforced by increasing evidence that the lockdowns have not had any effect on reducing deaths from the coronavirus, and may in fact increase the number of coronavirus deaths by delaying the point at which enough people have built up an immune response to slow its spread. Even the World Health Organization is now admitting lockdowns are rarely an effective response to the pandemic.\n\nThe Human Cost of Lockdowns\n\nThis critical information does not seem to have permeated the larger public, however. No news ticker will display the number of lockdown-induced fatalities. In part, this is due to the pervasive bias of the mainstream media in supporting Democrats\u2019 lockdown policies.\n\nBut it is also due to the nature of the message. Deaths from the Wuhan virus are a single number from a single cause, but deaths due to the lockdowns come from many different sources, such as:\n\nAttempts have been made to pull these diverse causalities into one model. A group of South African actuaries advised their government that a lockdown would cost 29 lives for every one life saved from the virus. A U.K. government study estimated more conservatively that the ratio would be four-to-one \u2014 with lockdowns causing 200,000 fatalities while saving only 50,000 people from death by COVID-19.\n\nTo get this message across, we need such a number for the United States. To penetrate the media barrier and general public miasma about this disease, we need to be able to present this formulation: For every X lives that continued lockdowns might save, X + Y lives will be lost due to those very lockdowns.\n\nFortunately, there is someone in the White House now who knows exactly what is needed. In May, before he joined the COVID-19 task force, Dr. Scott Atlas and several colleagues published an excellent article in The Hill surveying the extensive public health costs of the economic collapse resulting from the lockdowns.\n\nIn an interview about the article, Atlas noted that he and his colleagues did \u201cnot do any sort of model or complex hypothetical projection. We looked at established retrospective data that has been done that is empirical that correlates loss of economic productivity, unemployment, and similarly, the health care losses that we went through.\u201d\n\nNow we need a model that will pull together all the factors to let us make a life-for-life, death-for-death comparison of the threat of this disease versus the horrific costs of lockdowns as a therapy. A therapy that results in more harm than good is no therapy at all, but we need a number to make that salient to the public.\n\nEnough with the Partisan \u2018Experts\u2019\n\nOf course, the left and the media will attack any number put forward by Atlas or anyone else who does not openly despise President Donald Trump. Of necessity, any such model will be based on estimates and assumptions, and it will require projections since the lockdown-related health damage will continue for years and decades. It will, however, get the topic of costly lockdown tradeoffs into the public consciousness.\n\nThis will have another effect on the conversation. Joe Biden has declared he will impose a national lockdown if \u201cthat\u2019s what the scientists say\u201d we need. A debate over the public health costs of the lockdowns will vividly demonstrate how little Biden and his fellow Democrats understand science. Science requires many points of view, rigorously tested, and challenged to arrive at any type of conclusion. A \u201cscience\u201d of politically correct groupthink is worthless and not real science at all.\n\nThat means policymakers cannot abdicate their responsibilities to \u201cexperts.\u201d Experts disagree, as they should. It is Biden\u2019s choice to pick advisors like Dr. Zeke Emanuel, who would have us locked down until the coronavirus has effectively disappeared and who makes money off of lockdown consulting. Biden bears responsibility for heeding those partisans rather than the thousands of signatories of the Great Barrington Declaration.\n\nThese blindered public health \u201cexperts,\u201d such as Dr. Anthony \u201chunker down\u201d Fauci, see nothing but the coronavirus death numbers, choosing to ignore the massive costs of the Democrats\u2019 lockdowns. While the left continues to fetishize technocratic expertise, blindly deferring to those elites rather than accepting democratic accountability for their policy choices, their lockdowns continue, leaving a rising death toll in their wake.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/472725-judge-denies-request-for-stay-on-mcgahn", "authors": [], "title": "Judge denies request for stay on McGahn testimony", "text": "A U.S. district judge denied the Justice Department\u2019s request for a stay on testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\nU.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in a 17-page opinion that a long-term stay on her opinion last week requiring McGahn to testify in front of the House Judiciary Committee could cause \u201cgrave harm\u201d to the investigation.\n\n\u201cThis Court has no doubt that further delay of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s enforcement of its valid subpoena causes grave harm to both the Committee\u2019s investigation and the interests of the public more broadly,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe judge, who was appointed by former President Obama, also decided to remove a temporary stay she agreed upon last week while the case moved up to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

This is a developing story \u2026\n\nBOSTON (February 1, 2020) \u2013 The first case of the 2019 novel coronavirus in Massachusetts has been confirmed in a man returning from Wuhan, China who is in his 20s and lives in Boston. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) were notified by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the positive test results late Friday evening. This is the eighth case of infection with 2019 novel coronavirus reported in the United States. The risk to the public from the 2019 novel coronavirus remains low in Massachusetts.\n\nThe man recently traveled to Wuhan, China, and sought medical care soon after his return to Massachusetts. He has been isolated since that time and will continue to remain isolated until cleared by public health officials. His few close contacts have been identified and are being monitored for any sign of symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful that this young man is recovering and sought medical attention immediately,\u2019\u2019 said Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel. \u201cMassachusetts has been preparing for a possible case of this new coronavirus, and we were fortunate that astute clinicians took appropriate action quickly.

The risk to the general public remains low. And we continue to be confident we are in a good position to respond to this developing situation.\u201d\n\nDPH and BPHC continue to work closely with the CDC to maintain vigilance during this virus outbreak.\n\nThe novel coronavirus has resulted in thousands of confirmed human infections in more than 20 countries, with more than 99 percent of cases in China. To date, eight cases have been confirmed in the US: three people in California, two in Illinois and one individual each in Massachusetts, Washington State, and Arizona.\n\nOn Friday, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared the 2019 novel coronavirus a public health emergency and ordered any US citizens returning from the center of the outbreak in China to be quarantined for two weeks as a precaution. This followed a declaration Thursday by the World Health Organization that the coronavirus outbreak is a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Also that day the CDC reported the first case of person-to-person transmission in Illinois between household members.\n\nMassachusetts state health officials, in conjunction with Massport, local health departments, and other medical partners, have responded to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nAmong the steps taken by the Department of Public Health:\n\nEstablished an Incident Command Structure to facilitate regular dissemination of information from federal and state partners to statewide stakeholders.\n\nLaunched a new website that provides up-to-date information on the status of novel coronavirus for all residents: https://www.mass.gov/2019coronavirus.\n\nDeveloped and disseminated clinical advisories to all Massachusetts health care providers and issued guidance to hospitals, health systems, and Emergency Medical Services.\n\nScheduled calls with other key health care partners including local boards of health.\n\nCoronaviruses are respiratory viruses and are generally spread through respiratory secretions (droplets from coughs and sneezes) of an infected person to another person. Symptoms of novel coronavirus include fever, cough and shortness of breath, and, in severe cases, pneumonia (fluid in the lungs). Information about how this novel coronavirus spreads is still limited.\n\nAlthough the risk of the coronavirus to Massachusetts residents remains low, people are advised to take many of the same steps they do to help prevent colds and the flu, including:\n\nTIPS TO HELP STAY HEALTHY\u2026\n\nWash hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nCover coughs and sneezes.\n\nStay home when feeling sick.\n\nClinicians who see patients with recent travel in China, especially Hubei Province, who have a fever,\n\nlower respiratory tract symptoms (such as shortness of breath and cough), and/or contact with a\n\nknown novel coronavirus patient, should contact DPH 24/7 at (617) 983-6800 for assistance. In\n\nBoston, providers should contact BPHC at 617-534-5611.\n\nThe new DPH website provides relevant up-to-date information on the state of the novel coronavirus for all residents: mass.gov/2019coronavirus.\n\nAdditional details and guidance regarding the novel coronavirus, is available from the CDC: 2019 Novel Coronavirus.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/14/us/jersey-city-shooting-suspect-francine-graham/index.html", "authors": ["Ray Sanchez"], "title": "To those who knew NJ shooter Francine Graham say, rampage bring complete bafflement", "text": "(CNN) Francine Graham was an occasional babysitter in the West Harlem housing project where she grew up and former neighbors still remember her as polite and caring.\n\nDecades later, when she settled into a townhouse complex in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Graham worked as a certified nurse's aide for a health center run by the Catholic Church and looked out for ailing neighbors, according her former employer and residents who interacted with her.\n\n\"She was good people,\" Edwin Lopez, 62, who exchanged pleasantries with her while walking his dog, Nike, at the Water's Edge Crescent complex in Elizabethport. \"You just never know who you're living next to.\"\n\nThe hours-long police standoff ended with their deaths. For those who saw Graham as kind, normal and neighborly, it brought complete bafflement.\n\n\"That was not the Francine that I knew,\" said Estelle Rodriguez, 73, who four decades ago moved to the 19th-floor apartment across from the Grahams in West Harlem's Manhattanville Houses. \"We were like family.

MUST WATCH Police officer among six dead after Jersey City standoff 01:20\n\nDavid Anderson\n\nStill, a 2009 police report detailed a domestic-violence incident in which Anderson allegedly threatened to kill his then-girlfriend. Additionally, in two other cases from 2003 and 2007, Anderson was arrested for unlawful possession of weapons. In both cases, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to jail, according to court records.\n\nGraham, on the other hand, had no criminal history. She worked for nearly 20 years as a nurse's aide at the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center in Manhattan, according to public records.\n\n\"We are stunned that an individual who was once associated with our ministry was involved in such a senseless and tragic act,\" the New York Archdiocese-operated health center said in a statement, adding it was cooperating with investigators.\n\n\"We continue to pray for those who were killed or injured, for their loved ones, and for the Jersey City Police Department and other law enforcement agencies as they themselves mourn.\"\n\nAt the Manhattanville Houses, where Graham's mother still lives, a man who answered the door at her apartment said the family had no comment.\n\nAnderson looked \"like he was mad with the world all the time,\" former neighbor says\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Anderson and Graham expressed interest in the Black Hebrew Israelites movement , but authorities have not found any definitive links between them and that organization or other group.\n\nInvestigators believe the shooters were motivated by hate and acted on their own. It's not known why Anderson and Graham attacked the detective and the kosher supermarket in particular, according to Grewal.\n\nOn Tuesday, a man and woman identified as Anderson and Graham were captured on surveillance footage firing on the kosher market , authorities said. Anderson emerged from a U-Haul van, leaving the driver's door ajar. Graham jumped out the passenger side.\n\nAnderson stepped across the street, his rifle pointed at the market, the footage showed. Bursts of gunfire erupted as he advanced. Graham, also carrying a long gun, followed behind.\n\nAt the door to the market, Anderson stopped and looked back at Graham. They then sprayed the market with bullets, authorities said. He used an AR-15-style weapon; she had a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun. Other firearms and a pipe bomb were recovered.\n\nGraham had purchased the shotgun and a Ruger firearm in Ohio in the spring of 2018, according to the attorney general.\n\n\"I was shocked it was her,\" said Larry Baisden, 56, who lives across the street from the apartment Graham once shared with Anderson.\n\n\"She didn't seem like that kind of person. But him. I didn't know him... He always stood by the fence and he would stare out and look like he was mad with the world all the time.\"\n\nFBI agents visited Graham's old neighborhood\n\nGraham and Baisden, who has lived at New Jersey townhouse complex for nine years, usually talked when they were at the outdoor mailboxes in the middle of their block. After he fell and broke his hip last year, he said, she revealed her background as a home health aide.\n\n\"She let me know if I needed any help with anything ... to just come over to the door and let her know,\" he said.\n\nNeighbors said Graham, whom public records show took out a mortgage on her Elizabeth townhouse apartment in 2011, used to stand outside to smoke cigarettes. She always offered greetings and small talk. She did walking exercises with her upstairs neighbor, according to Baisden and other neighbors.\n\n\"She was always friendly and nice when I saw her,\" he recalled.\n\nIn an apartment next to the townhouse where Graham lived, FBI agents this week showed up at the door of a neighbor who identified himself as Drake Surjet, 22, he said. Serge has lived there about three years. An agent showed him Graham's photo and asked whether he had heard of the shooting in Jersey City, he said. They asked about her accomplice.\n\n\"Yes, there was that weirdo that moved in with her,\" Surjet said he told them.\n\nAround 2017, when Anderson first appeared at the complex, Graham's life appeared to go \"downhill,\" according to Surjet. After Anderson moved in, chanting and rituals could be heard in the apartment at night, he said.\n\nGraham told neighbors she stopped working that year after suffering a back injury, Surjet said.\n\n\"She was always been talking about, 'I need a boyfriend. I want a boyfriend and it's so hard for me to get one,'\" he recalled. \"That's what she used to tell us ... I guess he took advantage of that.\"\n\nIn 2018, Graham defaulted on her mortgage, public records show. After getting evicted, Surjet said, the couple started living out of Anderson's white van, which would be parked on a side street outside the apartment entrance. Sometimes they would break in to shower, he said.\n\n\"Honestly, she was just a nice lady that used stand outside and smoke her cigarettes,\" Surjet said. \"If she saw you, she'd say, 'Hi, how are you doing?' Then she would go inside and live her life. Until she met that guy.\"\n\nNeighbor remembers a young Graham running through the corridor\n\nAbout 30 miles northeast of Elizabeth, Estelle Rodriguez was at a West Harlem supermarket this week when a neighbor told her Graham had been shot and killed in the Jersey City rampage.\n\n\"I felt sick,\" Rodriguez said. \"I couldn't finish shopping. This was not the person I knew.\"\n\nRodriguez said she last saw Graham at the Manhattanville Houses about a year ago. Graham told her she had been caring for her ailing mother. Rodriguez recalled a 10-year-old Graham running through the building corridor with the open terrace that overlooked wide tree-lined paths.\n\n\"These are good people,\" she said of Graham's family. \"No one here will tell you anything bad about her or parents. I'm not justifying what she did.\"\n\nDown the hall, Alice Harriot, 67, said Graham, in her 20s, used to occasionally take care of her children. Graham's mother used to pick up her kids at school, Harriot said.\n\nShe has lived there for close to a half-century. Harriot said she still exchanges Christmas cards with neighbors, including the Grahams.\n\n\"I couldn't even eat, I was so distraught,\" Harriot said of her reaction to seeing Graham's photo on the TV news. \"I was so disappointed. The disbelief. I prayed to go to sleep. That's how hurt I was.\"\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled the name of Drake Surjet.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/eu-stance-focus-decision-israeli-settlements-191127094035246.html", "authors": ["Ben White"], "title": "EU stance in focus after US decision on Israeli settlements", "text": "The recent United States announcement that it no longer believes the establishment of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank is \"inconsistent with international law\" provoked an immediate response internationally, including in Brussels.\n\nWithin hours of the US statement, European Union senior foreign affairs official Federica Mogherini issued a statement affirming that the EU's position \"is clear and remains unchanged: all [Israeli] settlement activity is illegal under international law and ... erodes the viability of the two-state solution.\"\n\nMore:\n\n\"The EU calls on Israel to end all settlement activity, in line with its obligations as an occupying power,\" the short statement added.\n\nIn a separate development, days before the US announcement, Europe's highest court - the European Court of Justice (ECJ) - ruled that produce from Israeli settlements built on occupied Palestinian land must be labelled as such, so consumers can make \"informed choices\".\n\nThe ruling is likely to \"increase pressure for more proactive enforcement\" within the EU, according to Martin Konecny, director of European Middle East Project (EuMEP), a think-tank in Brussels.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the US policy shift and the European court ruling is representative of increasingly divergent approaches to the settlements in Washington and Brussels.\n\nIndeed, some in Israel made an explicit contrast; Transport Minister Bezalel Smotrich both praised the US announcement and described it as \"a worthy response\" to the ECJ ruling, adding: \"We are advancing international recognition of the settlement project.\"\n\nCondemnation and complicity\n\nAs the Trump administration has steadily abandoned the framework of a two-state solution, the EU has remained committed to what it sees as the ultimate end goal to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nIn practical terms, the EU has focused on strong, bilateral ties with Israel, in the form of economic arrangements and treaties, academic research, and \"security\" cooperation, which has deepened alongside EU criticism of policies such as settlement expansion and home demolitions.\n\n\"The EU's condemnations of Israel's policy are not enough\", said Aneta Jerska, coordinator of the European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine (ECCP), a platform of 40 European Palestine solidarity organisations.\n\n\"The EU is deeply complicit in Israel's violations of international law and Palestinian rights by financing the very same Israeli entities that it criticises,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\nFederica Mogherini affirmed the EU's commitment to the two-state solution [Toby Melville/Reuters]\n\nJerska cited EU funding for Israeli universities with campuses located in occupied territories or those that conduct weapons research, funding for Israeli water firm Mekorot - criticised in United Nations's reports for its role in international law violations - and even research programme funding for Israeli arms companies.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU has committed considerable financial resources towards supporting and sustaining the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs some areas of the West Bank and remains dependent on external funding to function.\n\nIn a recent interview with Arab News, the EU's special representative for the Middle East peace process, Susanna Terstal, described the EU as \"one of the biggest donors to the Palestinians\", revealing over the past 15 years, the EU and its member states \"have spent 10 billion euros ($11bn)\".\n\n\"We spend that money for making the two-state solution possible,\" Terstal added.\n\nHowever, despite the unwavering policy goal of a two-state solution, certain EU policies have boosted elements seen as obstacles to such an outcome.\n\n\"The EU continues to trade with settlements,\" Konecny told Al Jazeera, noting the EU imports 15 times more from illegal settlements \"than from the Palestinians in the occupied territories\".\n\nChange at the top\n\nThere has been a recent change of personnel at the top in Brussels with Mogherini on her way out, and her successor as EU's next foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, soon to take the reins.\n\nIn comments on November 11 reflecting on her term, Mogherini stuck to familiar talking points - that a two-state solution is still possible and \"the only realistic solution that we have at hand\".\n\nAlthough Borrell has been a vocal critic of Israeli policies in the past, it remains to be seen whether that translates to action when in office.\n\n191120100939634\n\nMeanwhile, political divisions within the EU are also reflected in differences over foreign policy, with the bloc struggling to find a common position on the settlements issue.\n\nFor his part, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has in recent years strengthened ties with some ultra-nationalist Eastern European governments, seemingly partly in an attempt to further split the bloc on Israeli issues.\n\nHungary reportedly blocked an effort to get all 28 EU member states to issue a joint statement condemning the US policy shift on settlements, while the Dutch parliament passed a non-binding motion dissenting from the ECJ ruling on settlement produce labelling, which was subsequently rejected by the Dutch government.\n\nSuch actions contrast, however, with Luxembourg's call for the EU to recognise a Palestinian state, or the declaration made ahead of a UN Security Council meeting last week by the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland that \"all settlement activity is illegal under international law\".\n\nCarrots but no sticks\n\nThis kind of commitment means some Palestinians see an opportunity. \"The European role couldn't be more vital given the Trump administration's shredding of international law,\" Nadia Hijab, board president of the Al-Shabaka think-tank, told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The focus should be on those states likely to be supportive - Sweden, Ireland, Belgium, Spain - as well as states that are sensitive to being seen to uphold the law, especially France, which took a stand on labelling that led to the ECJ rule, and Germany,\" Hijab said.\n\nBut, she added, \"the key is for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and PA [Palestinian Authority] to get their act together. If they don't push, as Israel does, then this will be another golden opportunity wasted.\"\n\nAnother push will likely come from the European and Palestinian human rights organisations, which in the words of Jerska are demanding the EU \"comply with its own legislation and international law\".\n\n191119194804911\n\n\"The EU can and should first of all ban all economic transactions with illegal Israeli settlements,\" she said, as well as \"exclude all Israeli military companies from its research programmes\".\n\nFor Jerska and other campaigners, the EU and its member states should ultimately be looking to apply \"restrictive measures\" - including by suspending the Association Agreement - \"as a way to pressure Israel\".\n\nFor now, it is hard to imagine the EU abandoning its \"carrots but no sticks\" approach. Recent years, however, have seen EU officials start to acknowledge the divergence between the \"two-state solution\" framework and the facts on the ground.\n\nMogherini's office, for example, warned in 2017 and again in 2018 of Israeli policies that \"further entrench a one-state reality of unequal rights, perpetual occupation and conflict\".\n\n\"Privately, many EU officials doubt the two-state solution's feasibility,\" Konecny told Al Jazeera. \"But there is no serious consideration of alternatives and a one-state solution with equal rights for everyone is widely seen as unrealistic - that's why the Europeans are doubling down on their commitment to two states.\"\n\nPressure from below - by European citizens or a future shift in tack by the Palestinian leadership - both have the potential to impact decision-makers in Brussels, but for now, analysts say, the most likely short-term outcome is EU policy paralysis.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://people.com/tv/jersey-shore-ronnie-ortiz-magro-pregnancy-scare-jen-harley/", "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "title": "Jersey Shore: Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Thinks Jen Harley Might Be Pregnant Again", "text": "Ronnie Ortiz-Magro dropped a bombshell on his roomies during Thursday\u2019s episode of Jersey Shore: Family Vacation.\n\nIn the wake of Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino\u2018s sentencing, the cast decided to road-trip to the Stony Creek Ranch in Lake George, New York, to take his mind off of things.

He\u2019ll undergo surgery on the knee.\n\nMonday\u2019s decision ends Vinatieri\u2019s 14-year career with the Indianapolis Colts and perhaps his 24-year career in the NFL. Only George Blanda (26) and Morten Andersen (25) logged more seasons. Only Andersen (382) appeared in more regular-season games than Vinatieri (365). No one has scored more points than Vinatieri, either in the regular season (2,673) or postseason (238).\n\nVinatieri, who turns 47 Dec. 28, will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season.\n\nVinatieri endured the worst season of his decorated career. He\u2019s missed a career-high 14 kicks \u2013 eight field goals and six PATs \u2013 and his 68.0 percent conversion rate (17-of-25) is easily the lowest of a career that began in 1996 with the New England Patriots.\n\nIn mid-November, Vinatieri conceded \u201cit\u2019s been an interesting year to say the least. I feel like it\u2019s been an up-and-down year for sure.\u201d\n\nMuch of the blame can be traced to a knee injury that first surfaced during training camp. It forced him to miss a few weeks, after which Vinatieri believed he \u201cgot it kind of under control.\u201d\n\nHowever, it actually lingered into the regular season \u2013 he missed two field goals and three PATs in the first two games \u2013 and required constant treatment.\n\nVinatieri first appeared on the NFL\u2019s weekly injury report Wednesday when he was listed as a limited participant. That was a result of discomfort in the knee increasing last week and becoming more acute following Sunday\u2019s 31-17 loss to Tennessee during which he missed three kicks, two of which were blocked.\n\n\u201cJust a little more sharp (pain) than it was before,\u201d he said.\n\nVinatieri had an MRI on his left knee last week to determine the nature and severity of the injury, then met with Chris Ballard and members of the medical staff to determine the best course of action.\n\n\u201cProbably a collection of all of us, I suppose,\u201d he said. \u201cDocs and trainers and everybody will put their two-cents in and we\u2019ll see if we can go. If I can go, I\u2019ll go.\u201d\n\nThat obviously wasn\u2019t the decision.\n\nThe Colts prepared for Vinatieri\u2019s departure by claiming rookie placekicker Chase McLaughlin off waivers last week. He handled the kicking duties in Sunday\u2019s 38-35 loss at Tampa Bay. McLaughlin hit 50- and 19-yard field goals and three PATs, but missed a crucial 47-yarder in the fourth quarter.\n\nIn 24 seasons, Vinatieri established himself as the greatest kicker in NFL and Colts\u2019 history, and laid the foundation to be a likely first-ballot inductee in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAlong with being the NFL\u2019s all-time leader in points and made field goals (599), his 1,515 points and 394 field goals are most in Colts history. During a 22-game stretch that spanned 2015-16, Vinatieri set the league record with 44 consecutive successful field goals.\n\nVinatieri\u2019s 14 seasons with the Colts is tied for second-most behind John Unitas\u2019 17. That comes after a 10-year career with the New England Patriots.\n\nAlso, Vinatieri appeared in 205 games, trailing only Reggie Wayne (211), Peyton Manning (208) and Unitas (206) in team history.\n\nIn the postseason, Vinatieri holds records for points (234), made field goals (56), field goal attempts (68) and consecutive games with at least one point (30). Twice, he delivered game-winning, clock-beating field goals to win Super Bowl titles for the New England Patriots.

Two of those sources said that State Department officials, including Secretary Mike Pompeo, are also open to weighing the French proposal, in which the Paris government would effectively ease the economic sanctions regime that the Trump administration has applied on Tehran for more than a year.\n\nThe deal put forward by France would compensate Iran for oil sales disrupted by American sanctions. A large portion of Iran\u2019s economy relies on cash from oil sales. Most of that money is frozen in bank accounts across the globe. The $15 billion credit line would be guaranteed by Iranian oil. In exchange for the cash, Iran would have to come back into compliance with the nuclear accord it signed with the world\u2019s major powers in 2015. Tehran would also have to agree not to threaten the security of the Persian Gulf or to impede maritime navigation in the area. Lastly, Tehran would have to commit to regional Middle East talks in the future.\n\nWhile Trump has been skeptical of helping Iran without preconditions in public, the president has at least hinted at an openness to considering Macron\u2019s pitch for placating the Iranian government\u2014a move intended to help bring the Iranians to the negotiating table and to rescue the nuclear agreement that Trump and his former national security adviser John Bolton worked so hard to torpedo.\n\nAt the G7 meeting in Biarritz, France last month, Trump told reporters that Iran might need a \u201cshort-term letter of credit or loan\u201d that could \u201cget them over a very rough patch.\u201d\n\nIranian Prime Minister Javad Zarif made a surprise appearance at that meeting. To Robert Malley, who worked on Iran policy during the Obama administration, that visit indicated that \u201cTrump must have signaled openness to Macron\u2019s idea, otherwise Zarif would not have flown to Biarritz at the last minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, Trump responded to Macron in a way that gave the French president a reason to invite Zarif, and Zarif a reason to come,\u201d he said.\n\nThe French proposal would require the Trump administration to issue waivers on Iranian sanctions. That would be a major departure from the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign to exact financial punishments on the regime in Tehran. Ironically, during his time in office, President Barack Obama followed a not-dissimilar approach to bring the Iranians to the negotiating table, throttling Iran\u2019s economy with sanctions before pledging relief for talks. The negotiations resulted in the Iran nuke deal that President Trump called \u201crotten\u201d\u2014and pulled the U.S. out of during his first term.\n\nTrump\u2019s flirtations with\u2014if not outright enthusiasm toward\u2014chummily sitting down with foreign dictators and America\u2019s geopolitical foes are largely driven by his desire for historic photo ops and to be seen as the dealmaker-in-chief. It\u2019s a desire so strong that it can motivate him to upturn years of his own administration\u2019s policymaking and messaging.\n\nAnd while President Trump has not agreed to anything yet, he did signal a willingness to cooperate on such a proposal at various times throughout the last month, including at the G7 meeting in Biarritz, France, according to four sources with knowledge of the president\u2019s conversations about the deal.\n\nSeveral sources told The Daily Beast that foreign officials are expecting Trump to either agree to cooperate on the French deal or to offer to ease some sanctions on Tehran. Meanwhile, President Trump is also considering meeting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September.\n\n\u201cI do believe they\u2019d like to make a deal. If they do, that\u2019s great. And if they don\u2019t, that\u2019s great too,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut they have tremendous financial difficulty, and the sanctions are getting tougher and tougher.\u201d When asked if he would ease sanctions against Iran in order to get a meeting with Iran Trump simply said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. I think Iran has a tremendous, tremendous potential.\u201d\n\nSpokespeople for the State Department, White House, and Treasury did not provide comment for this story. A spokesperson for the National Security Council simply referred The Daily Beast to Trump\u2019s Wednesday comments on Iran. Bolton didn\u2019t comment on Wednesday, either.\n\n\u201c By the end he viewed [Bolton] as an arsonist hell bent on setting fire to anyone\u2019s agenda that didn\u2019t align with his own\u2014including the president\u2019s. \u201d \u2014 source close to Mike Pompeo\n\nTrump\u2019s willingness to discuss the credit line with the French, the Iranians and also Japanese President Shinzo Abe frustrated Bolton, who had for months urged Trump not to soften his hard line against the regime in Tehran.\n\nBolton, who vociferously opposed the Macron proposal, departed the Trump administration on explicitly and mutually bad terms on Tuesday. On Bolton\u2019s way out of the door, Trump and senior administration officials went out of their way to keep publicly insisting he was fired, as Bolton kept messaging various news outlets that Trump couldn\u2019t fire him because he quit. The former national security adviser and lifelong hawk had ruffled so many feathers and made so many enemies in the building that his senior colleagues had repeatedly tried to snitch him out to Trump for allegedly leaking to the media.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Bolton messaged The Daily Beast to say that allegations about him being a leaker were \u201cflatly incorrect.\u201d\n\nAt a press briefing held shortly after Bolton\u2019s exit on Tuesday, neither Secretary of State Mike Pompeo nor Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin showed much sympathy for Bolton\u2019s falling star in Trumpworld. \u201cThere were many times Ambassador Bolton and I disagreed,\u201d Pompeo told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s to be sure, but that\u2019s true with a lot of people with whom I interact.\u201d\n\nAccording to those who know Pompeo well, the secretary\u2019s public statement was a glaring understatement.\n\n\u201cBy the end he viewed [Bolton] as an arsonist hell bent on setting fire to anyone\u2019s agenda that didn\u2019t align with his own\u2014including the president\u2019s,\u201d said a source close to Pompeo who\u2019s discussed Bolton with the secretary in recent weeks. Pompeo \u201cbelieves him to be among the most self-centered people he\u2019s ever worked with. A talented guy, no doubt, but not someone who was willing to subordinate his ego to the president\u2019s foreign-policy agenda.\u201d\n\nWhether or not the president follows through with supporting Macron is unclear, as Trump is known to consider or temporarily back high-profile domestic or foreign policy initiatives, only to quickly backtrack or about-face.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29955/u-s-destroyer-arrives-off-saudi-arabia-amid-plans-to-bolster-the-kingdoms-air-defenses", "authors": ["Joseph Trevithick", "Tyler Rogoway"], "title": "U.S. Destroyer Arrives Off Saudi Arabia Amid Plans To Bolster The Kingdom's Air Defenses", "text": "Just having the ship in this location, where its radar and other sensors may be able to better detect missile or drone launches, provide early warning, and identify their points of origin, may also simply have a deterrent effect. The destroyer is also armed with Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles in some of those launch cells, which could launch retaliatory strikes on Iran over the attacks in Saudi Arabia, something the U.S. government is now reportedly considering . The ship could also work to quickly destroy the launch sites of any drone or cruise missile it detects going forward, if that information becomes available. It is interesting to remember that USS Nitze was involved in Tomahawk strikes on Houthi-controlled radar sites in Yemen in October 2016 after the Yemeni rebels fired anti-ship cruise missiles at American warships.\n\nNitze is part of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, which has been in the Middle East since May 2019 . The USS Abraham Lincoln, its air wing, and escorts rushed to the region ahead of schedule following the U.S. government's announcement that month that intelligence showed the increased potential for attacks on American military personnel and other interests by Iran or its proxies.\n\nA map showing Abqaiq and Khurais. The solid blue and red circles indicate what the Saudis estimate the maximum range cruise missiles and suicide drones to have been, making impossible for them to have flown from Yemen.\n\nThis comes a day after Saudi Arabian authorities presented the remains of various missiles and drones that they recovered after the attacks on Abqaiq and the Khurais oil field, as well as other detail about the incidents, which occurred on Sept. 14-15, 2019. Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Saudi Arabia says that the weapons involved came from Iran and were too short range to have flown to their targets from Yemen. The government in Riyadh has not yet blamed a specific group, though U.S. officials say they have separate evidence, which has not been presented publicly, showing that Iran directly carried out the strikes and that they originated in that country.\n\nCBS News was first to report the movement of the Nitze on Sept. 20, 2019. Later that same day, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford announced plans for a \"moderate\" deployment of additional personnel to Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the near future, though they also stressed that no firm decisions had been made about the composition or total size of that force or where it would be positioned within the region.\n\nMake sure to read our complete analysis on the strikes and the greater issues surrounding them, including the inability of modern air defense systems to deal with drone swarms, by clicking here.\n\nThe U.S. Navy has reportedly deployed the Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Nitze to the northern end of the Persian Gulf ostensibly to help shore up Saudi Arabian air defenses in the wake of unprecedented mass cruise missile and suicide drone attacks on sites critical to the country's oil industry. The U.S. military is now in the process of drafting up plans to send additional air and missile defense assets and other forces to Saudi Arabia, as well as the United Arab Emirates, to help shield against any future attacks. Existing Saudi surface-to-air missile systems and anti-aircraft guns, particularly those situated in close proximity to the Abqaiq oil processing facility, were notably ineffective in repelling the attacks.\n\nStarting in 1988, Saudi Arabia also began acquiring Skyguard fire control systems to improve the capabilities of its Oerlikon GDFs, which the country had purchased more than a decade earlier. The complete Skyguard system includes an air search radar, a fire control radar, and an optical tracking system.\n\nShahine's launchers also carry six missiles instead of the usual four. As with Crotale, Shahine cues its command-guided missiles with a combintion of radar and electro-optical and infrared cameras to zero in on their targets. This system has been in operational use in Saudi Arabia since 1980.\n\nShahine, also known as the R460, is a version of the French-made Crotale that Thales-CSF developed specifically for Saudi Arabia in the late 1970s. The major difference is that Shahine's launch units and its air search radar are mounted on armored, tracked chasses derived from the French AMX-30 main battle tank. Standard Crotale uses unarmored 4x4 wheeled carriers.\n\nA battery of long-range Patriot surface-to-air missiles was also present to the southwest, having apparently shifted from another position to the northeast of the site. Again, it is unclear exactly when this movement occurred.\n\nSatellite imagery of the oil processing facility has suggested that its point air defenses at the time of the attack may have consisted of a single battery of Shahine surface-to-air missiles and an array of Oerlikon GDF 35mm automatic guns. As of this week, emplacements that had held two other Oerlikon GDF batteries were empty, but it is unclear if this occurred before or after the strikes. At most, there would have been three sets of these guns.\n\nIf nothing else, the ship adds another layer of defense, and an especially capable one, against any additional attacks in the immediate future. This could be very reassuring to Saudi Arabia, which saw its air defenses situated around Abqaiq proved to be completely ineffective during the incidents last weekend.\n\nShahine can operate in an entirely automatic mode, while Skyguard can be set up so that the associated guns automatically lock on to the targets that the system detects. The maximum target detection range, under optimal conditions, for both systems, which were intended to look for large aircraft and helicopter-sized threats, is just under 12 and a half miles. This is beyond the maximum effective range of both Shahine's missiles and the Oerlikon GDF's 35mm shells. The range at which these systems could have detected the smaller cruise missiles and suicide drones that Saudi Arabia has said were involved in the attacks would likely have been much shorter than that and other ground clutter may have helped mask their approach. All told, even if the systems were operating in their most automated modes, Saudi air defenders would have had just minutes\u2014or seconds\u2014to spot and then attempt to engage those threats. The Patriot battery in the area with its more powerful AN/MPQ-53 radar may have offered more advance warning, but it could still have had trouble separating the small, low-flying, and the case of the drones, slow-flying threats from background ground clutter, especially depending on its exact position in relation to the attacks. Abqaiq, as well as Khurais, are full of complex, metallic, radar-reflecting structures that could make spotting and engaging missiles or drones at very low altitudes potentially challenging from certain angles.\n\nWe also have no way of knowing what the alert posture was for the Saudi Arabian forces around Abqaiq and what direction their radars would have been focused on, if they were even switched on at all. There are reports that have indicated that the country's air defense networks, as a whole, have been almost exclusively pointed south toward Yemen, given the threat from Houthi rebels. The Patriot battery near Abqaiq, with its directional phased array radar, now shows signs of having been reoriented to the north in the aftermath of the attacks.\n\nIn addition, where ever the point of origin for the attacks turns out to have been, if the cruise missile and suicide drones struck their targets from the northwest, as the Saudis, as well as the Americans, have asserted, this could have been a deliberate choice on the part of the attackers to try to avoid Saudi air defenses. It may also have simply been a way of an attempt to mask where the attacks originated from. Nitze deployment off the coast is certainly a first step toward increasing the air and missile defense capabilities in the region and, perhaps more importantly, just the ability to better monitor the air space in and around the northern end of the Persian Gulf. The additional American deployments, which Secretary of Defense Esper and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Dunford said they would have more details on next week, will almost certainly include additional Patriot batteries and associated radars, among other assets. The United States had already announced plans to deploy Patriots to Saudi Arabia in July 2019. Esper and Dunford also said that the U.S. government would look to fast-track additional military aid to the Saudis, which could prove controversial. Many members of Congress have sought to slow the flow of arms to Saudi Arabia over allegations of war crimes in Yemen and the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey last year.\n\nUS Army US Army troops practice loading a Patriot surface-to-air missile launcher at Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn addition, Esper and Dunford called upon other members of the international community to consider contributing to the increased air defenses in Saudi Arabia, as well as the U.S.-backed maritime security effort in and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz, which is also aimed at deterring Iranian aggression. Saudi Arabia itself has previously said it has reached out to South Korea about unspecified air defense assistance. \"Regardless of where you think it came from, the fact is, the Saudis were attacked by both drones and cruise missiles and are still vulnerable to attack,\" Esper said. It is important to note that Abqaiq is the world largest oil processing facility and has been responsible for approximately 10 percent of oil production worldwide. This makes the limits of the Saudi's previous defense posture all the more glaring. It is, of course, worth remembering that no air defense network is perfect, or anywhere close to perfect, something the War Zone covered in great depth as part of our initial analysis of the attacks. No matter what additional air and missile defense assets arrive in Saudi Arabia, there could continue to be potential threats to facilities, such as those in Abqaiq. The previous attacks also highlight the immense burdens placed on defenders to protect against even relatively modest standoff strikes and underscore the rapidly evolving risk calculus for even major military powers when considering risks from missile and saturating drone attacks. \"No single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that,\" Dunford said at the press conference late on Sept. 20, 2019. \"A layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk.\" It's also worth noting, that while The Kingdom is a U.S. ally and a strategic concern due to its oil production, it is also its biggest foreign customer of American air defense systems. Just recently, the Saudis splurged on what would be an unprecedented upgrade to their air defense ecosystem worth tens of billions of dollars\u2014huge business for the defense industry in the United States. But those upgrades are focused more on countering ballistic missiles and traditional threats, not swarming drones or hordes of low-flying, relatively crude cruise missiles. The Pentagon's reactionary move to backstop the existing Saudi air defense network could also be seen in part as a move to stand behind the weapon systems the Saudis are buying or have already bought, and especially considering the Trump administration's close ties to the Saudi royal court. The Houthis, for their part, have claimed that they will stop firing missiles and suicide drones into Saudi Arabia entirely and will continue with that moratorium if the Saudis return the gesture and cease strikes on them. The Yemeni rebels have proposed such ceasefires in the past, without meaningful results in either direction, and it is unclear if this offer is genuine or is officials in Riyadh accept it in an effort to deescalate tensions.\n\nIran continues to deny any involvement in the latest attacks on Saudi Arabia and also says it will not sit down to talks with the United States unless the U.S. government eases sanctions. This looks unlikely to occur given that U.S. President Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Iran's central bank on Sept. 20, 2019. Iran has also threatened to retaliate if the U.S. military launches any strikes against its territory. \"We have many other military options available, should they be necessary,\" Esper said at the press conference. \"We urge the Iranian leadership to cease their destructive and destabilizing activities and to move forward on a peaceful diplomatic path.\" There's no indication that the Iranians feel inclined to change course yet, but whether that leads to more direct action from the United States or its partners remains to be seen. In the meantime, the U.S. government seems focused on bolstering Saudi Arabia's defenses against any new attacks with assets such as the Nitze.

He believes that the German court will ultimately rule in favor of Tesla, allowing the electric car maker to resume its tree-clearing activities in Brandenburg.\n\nTesla\u2019s tree-clearing operations were unfortunately halted on February 15 after the Berlin-Brandenburg Higher Administrative Court acknowledged a complaint submitted by a local environmental activist group known as the Green League of Brandenburg. The electric car maker has only been working on its tree-clearing activities for a few days then.\n\nSteinbach, for his part remains positive that this setback will be overcome and construction crews can get back to work as soon as possible. \u201cIf I delayed half a year or more, I would definitely see this risk,\u201d he noted.\n\n#GigaBerlin  The Minister of Economics of Brandenburg ( J\u00f6rg Steinbach ) just said in an interview that the court's decision is expected before the end of the week and that he is confident that TESLA will be able to continue its work next week.\ud83d\udc4c\ud83e\udd1e https://t.co/kIP7eDZs0z\n\nSteinbach has been one of Tesla\u2019s biggest supporters since CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla will be building a factory near Berlin, which would be producing the Model Y crossover and Model 3 sedan. After Tesla received preliminary approval on February 13 from the Brandenburg State Office to begin clearing trees from the first 91.5 hectares of land, Steinbach shared a picture of the initial tree-clearing process taking place.\n\nSteinbach was also vocal in Tesla\u2019s ability to provide a boost to Germany\u2019s economy and provide jobs to German citizens. Most recently, Steinbach highlighted Tesla\u2019s ability to provide climate protection with its automobiles and technology. \u201cThe construction of the Tesla automobile plant in Brandenburg has been of great importance for more climate protection and one of the most important industrial settlements in the new federal states for a long time,\u201d he said to RTL.\n\nTesla was originally required to have the initial tree-clearing process finished by February 27. This was to prevent interference of the bird\u2019s breeding season that begins in early March. Depending on when the decision from the Berlin-Brandenburg Higher Administrative Court is received, Tesla may have to push back its completion date so local wildlife is not interfered with. Otherwise, the electric car maker would have to work double-time to ensure that it can meet its targets without compromising any of the wildlife in the area.\n\nEnvironmental groups have been concerned with Tesla\u2019s construction of the Giga Berlin plant, but the company has made every stride to alleviate their worries. Tesla, for one, has expressed its intention to replant the trees it removes three-fold in local areas that are currently being finalized.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Wed Feb 19 14:40:30 +0000 2020",

Scientists at the University of Southern California found that these symptoms tend to appear first and in a specific order.\n\nThis study is very interesting, the USC scientists found that when many people first start showing symptoms after being infected with the coronavirus, they tend to appear in this order: fever, then cough and muscle pain, followed by nausea, and/or vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\nI hear many of my patients worrying how they\u2019ll be able to tell if they\u2019ve picked up influenza or if it\u2019s COVID. So besides knowing that COVID-19 symptoms do have a common pattern when they first develop, the researchers also found that when it comes to influenza, coughing is usually the first symptom. Whereas fever as I mentioned earlier is the first symptom with COVID-19.\n\nAlso, adults rarely experience vomiting and diarrhea when infected with the flu. Whereas according to this research, vomiting and diarrhea are more common with COVID-19. So knowing this could help a person decide whether to get tested, to self-isolate or to seek help sooner rather than later.\n\nThe USC researchers looked at two datasets of COVID-19 patients from China, that when combined totaled just over 56,000 cases. And then they also looked at over 2,400 cases of influenza in North America, Europe, and the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nAfter crunching the data, they came up with this data. But it\u2019s important to keep in mind that this information should be used as a guideline only because not everyone develops the exact same symptoms.\n\nHaving said that, I think knowing that there is a likely order of COVID-19 symptoms can be quite useful especially for doctors. It could help them rule out other illnesses and decide whether someone likely has COVID-19 and what treatment to recommend.\n\nBut if someone believes that they do have the virus, you should seek testing regardless of what symptoms came first or second. And definitely to see medical help if your breathing is ever compromised.\n\nAdditional Coronavirus information and resources:\n\nClick here for a page with resources including a COVID-19 overview from the CDC, details on cases in Michigan, a timeline of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's orders since the outbreak, coronavirus' impact on Southeast Michigan, and links to more information from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC and the WHO.\n\nView a global coronavirus tracker with data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSee complete coverage on our Coronavirus Continuing Coverage page.\n\nVisit our The Rebound Detroit, a place where we are working to help people impacted financially from the coronavirus.

McGahn was a central witness in the two-year investigation led by former special counsel Robert Mueller into the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russians in 2016.\n\nHe ultimately provided damning evidence that Trump repeatedly sought to obstruct the probe, though he declined to recommend criminal charges, citing a Justice Department prohibition on moving against a sitting president.\n\nHouse Democrats are hopeful for a victory from the full appeals court, which is heavy with appointees of President Barack Obama and generally seen as more favorable to their arguments than the three-judge panel the House drew earlier this year and ruled against them 2-1.\n\nBut even if the D.C. Circuit ultimately orders McGahn to testify, Justice Department lawyers are expected to ask the Supreme Court to step in. The justices may well decide to freeze the status quo, putting potential high court arguments in the case off until the fall or winter and pushing off a final decision until well after Trump is sworn in for a second term as president or Joe Biden is sworn in for a first.\n\nThe appeals court heard the case Tuesday by teleconference due to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, it considered the McGahn dispute in tandem with another legal fight between the House and the Trump administration: a suit seeking to block officials from spending money on Trump\u2019s border wall project.\n\nJustice Department attorney Hashim Mooppan pleaded with the judges to steer clear of both fights. He accused the House of making a \u201cradical break\u201d with history by seeking to enmesh the judiciary in the interbranch battles.\n\n\u201cDisputes between the political branches about their institutional prerogatives have occurred since the founding, but lawsuits between them are a novel and unsanctioned tactic,\u201d Mooppan said.\n\nThere were a few technical glitches early in the arguments, as Moopan\u2019s voice disappeared amid a combination of rustling noises and outright silence. The questioning by judges was also more stilted than usual since the judges went one-by-one in order of seniority to ask questions, with no cross-talk or instant back-and-forth.\n\nHouse Democrats, who took power in 2019, quickly sought to secure McGahn\u2019s testimony, but Trump directed him to refuse cooperation and McGahn deferred. The White House asserted that McGahn was \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d to testifying, a position that seemed at odds with previous rulings requiring executive branch officials to talk to Congress. That led to a string of legal battles last fall that included a resounding win for the House at the District Court level, where Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson excoriated the Trump administration\u2019s posture toward Congress.\n\nBut in February, a three-judge D.C. Circuit panel swept aside Jackson\u2019s ruling and determined that the courts have no role settling disputes between the White House and Congress \u2014 a sweeping decision that would reshape Congress\u2019 ability to wrest information out of reluctant administrations.\n\nThe appeals court panel suggested Congress could use other political tools, short of court intervention, to force an administration to provide information: from cutting off funds to holding officials in contempt to impeaching the president \u2014 and in extreme cases, detaining or jailing administration officials. House lawyers emphasized they had pursued all of those tools short of physical detentions that they said would provoke an almost comical level of hostility between the branches, imagining gun battles between the House sergeant at arms and the FBI.\n\nMcGahn in a Cabinet meeting in 2018. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nJudge David Tatel, an appointee of of President Bill Clinton, returned to those issues Tuesday, asking Mooppan whether the dispute he urged the court to step aside from couldn\u2019t come right back to the court if the House chose to arrest McGahn.\n\nMooppan insisted the courts would have to free McGahn, even without wading into the merits of the subpoena fight.\n\n\u201cThat is beyond the scope of Congress\u2019 power,\u201d the Justice Department lawyer said about the prospect of such an arrest. \u201cCongress doesn\u2019t have any express authority to go around arresting people. \u2026There is simply no historical support for the notion that they can arrest an executive branch official for following executive branch directives.\u201d\n\nWriting for the majority in the February decision in the McGahn case, Judge Thomas Griffith said that allowing the courts to adjudicate such subpoenas would result in Congress abandoning the usual process of negotiation.\n\n\u201cThe walk from the Capitol to our courthouse is a short one, and if we resolve this case today, we can expect Congress\u2019s lawyers to make the trip often,\u201d wrote Griffith, an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\nThe victory for the president was short-lived, however, as just two weeks later the D.C. Circuit announced it was accepting the House\u2019s request that a rare \u201cen banc\u201d court convene to rehear the case.\n\nThe lineup of nine judges hearing the McGahn appeal Tuesday is starkly different ideologically from the increasingly conservative, nine-justice Supreme Court that could eventually resolve the case.\n\nThe active D.C. Circuit bench leans toward Democratic appointees, 7-4, but the two judges nominated by Trump recused themselves, leaving the court with only two GOP appointees among the nine judges hearing Tuesday\u2019s cases.\n\nTrump appointee Greg Katsas, who served in the White House counsel\u2019s office early in Trump\u2019s term, indicated during his confirmation hearings that he would likely recuse from cases stemming from the Mueller probe. It\u2019s less clear why the D.C. Circuit\u2019s newest member, Judge Neomi Rao, stepped aside, but from 2017 to 2019 she held a top position at the Office of Management and Budget, which is part of the White House.\n\nFor more than a decade, presidents and lawmakers from both parties have shied away from the sort of showdown that took place Tuesday before the powerful Washington-based appeals court. While Congress occasionally took such battles to court, both sides typically pulled back from the brink before the D.C. Circuit could issue a precedent-setting ruling.\n\nThe impulse to leave unresolved the question of the courts\u2019 role in enforcing congressional subpoenas directed to the executive branch led to negotiated settlements in two high-profile disputes in the past dozen years.\n\nIn 2009, Obama\u2019s new White House helped broker a compromise in a lingering battle over House Democrats\u2019 demands for testimony and documents from aides to Bush about his firing of eight U.S. attorneys after the 2006 election.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John Bates\u2014a Bush appointee\u2014rejected the Justice Department\u2019s claim of absolute immunity, insisting that the Bush aides could not ignore the House subpoenas. But Bates never waded into the issue of what specific questions had to be answered or what specific documents had to be forked over.\n\nUnder the 2009 deal, former White House counsel Harriet Miers and political strategist Karl Rove gave transcribed interviews to the House Judiciary Committee, while the Justice Department dropped its appeal of Bates\u2019 ruling.\n\nA similar fight broke out in 2012 as the GOP-led House sought documents from the Justice Department and White House pertaining to the fallout from Operation Fast and Furious, a federal gunrunning investigation that allowed as many as 2,000 weapons to be purchased illegally with many ending up in Mexico.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, an Obama appointee, echoed Bates\u2019 decision and turned down the Justice Department\u2019s call for the courts to butt out of the case. The legal battle bogged down for years as the DOJ tried to appeal while the White House also sought a compromise.\n\nUltimately, Obama turned over most of the documents lawmakers sought but the House appealed to get even more. The legal saga lingered into the Trump administration before it was finally settled last year, after both sides made an unsuccessful bid to wipe out Jackson\u2019s decision.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2020/12/29/22204772/yu-darvish-blake-snell-san-diego-padres-trades-aj-preller", "authors": ["Zach Kram", "Chris Vernon", "Kevin O'Connor", "David Shoemaker", "Jason Concepcion", "Mallory Rubin", "Sean Fennessey", "Amanda Dobbins", "Dave Chang", "Chris Ying"], "title": "With Yu Darvish and Blake Snell, the Padres Are Coming for the Dodgers\u2019 Crown", "text": "The hot stove hadn\u2019t yet had time to cool from the Padres\u2019 last big move, sending four young players to the Rays for Blake Snell, when San Diego struck again: Yu Darvish will reportedly also be a Padre next season, as the team is finalizing a trade to acquire Darvish and backup catcher Victor Caratini from the Cubs in exchange for pitcher Zach Davies and four more youngsters.\n\nThe dual moves affirmed San Diego GM A.J. Preller\u2019s aggressive team-building philosophy; they invigorated a dormant, languorous offseason just aching for activity. But perhaps most of all, they sent a message two hours up the California coast: Your move, Dodgers.\n\nRelated How the Padres and Rays Could Both Win the Blake Snell Trade\n\nThat braggadocious assumption isn\u2019t hyperbole. With Snell and Darvish (and Korean infielder Ha-seong Kim, who reportedly agreed to a deal with San Diego on Monday) in the fold, the Padres are just a rounding error away from the Dodgers in projected 2021 WAR, according to FanGraphs.\n\nThe Dodgers have a clear advantage in the outfield, with 2018 AL MVP Mookie Betts and 2019 MVP Cody Bellinger still in their primes. But the Padres might be better positioned everywhere else on the diamond, with FanGraphs\u2019 projections giving them the advantage across the other position groups. (The figures in this chart don\u2019t add up exactly because of rounding.)\n\nProjected 2021 WAR Position Group Dodgers Padres Difference Position Group Dodgers Padres Difference Infield 14.8 16.7 Padres +1.9 Outfield/DH 12.2 7.1 Dodgers +5.1 Starting Pitching 15.0 16.5 Padres +1.5 Relief Pitching 2.3 3.4 Padres +1.1 Overall 44.3 43.6 Dodgers +0.7\n\nProjections aren\u2019t sacrosanct, and margins this slim so far out from the season aren\u2019t particularly meaningful. But that\u2019s the point: The Padres are now close enough to the Dodgers to look like they\u2019re equals.\n\nIf the Snell trade was part Rays\u2019 financial shenanigans, part Padres\u2019 effort to replace the injured Mike Clevinger in the rotation, the Darvish deal is an outright robbery. With three years and $59 million remaining on his contract, the 34-year-old Darvish isn\u2019t as cheap as Snell, nor as young. But he\u2019s also one of the best pitchers in baseball, having recovered from 2018 injuries and a rough early adjustment with the Cubs to return to the top tier of MLB pitchers.\n\nSince the 2019 All-Star break, 80 pitchers have thrown at least 100 innings. Among that group, Darvish ranks:\n\nFifth in ERA (2.40)\n\nThird in FIP (2.54)\n\nFourth in strikeout rate (34.6 percent)\n\nSecond in walk rate (3.4 percent)\n\nFifth in ERA-based WAR (6.5 wins)\n\nFourth in FIP-based WAR (5.4 wins)\n\nSnell won the 2018 AL Cy Young award; Darvish finished second in NL voting in 2020. According to MLB researcher Sarah Langs, the Padres are the first team to acquire multiple pitchers with such recent high Cy Young finishes in the same offseason\u2014and they did so in the span of about 24 hours.\n\nThe new-look Padres rotation is, to use an esteemed industry term, absolutely bonkers, leading the majors in projected WAR even with Clevinger sidelined by Tommy John surgery. Darvish, Dinelson Lamet (a fourth-place Cy Young finisher in 2020), and Snell rank fifth, 12th, and 15th, respectively, in 2021 projections among individual pitchers, according to the Steamer system. No other team has even two pitchers in the top 15. (The Dodgers and Nationals are close, with Clayton Kershaw, Stephen Strasburg, and Patrick Corbin all just 0.1 projected WAR behind Snell.)\n\nIn 2022, Clevinger will return to the mound for the Padres while Darvish, Lamet, and Snell are all still under contract. MacKenzie Gore, the top pitching prospect in the world, will reach the majors soon, too.\n\nIt is hysterically funny how much talent the Padres have acquired for so little prospect return in the past 5 months\n\nAnd the cost to build this extraordinary rotation was eminently manageable. According to the rankings at both FanGraphs and Baseball America, the Padres kept six of their top seven prospects, losing only pitcher Luis Pati\u00f1o to the Rays from their top group. We covered the Snell return on Monday; the reported package for Darvish is even lighter, with the Cubs essentially pivoting to a far-off future despite winning the NL Central just last year and keeping World Series heroes Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant, and Javier B\u00e1ez under contract for just one more season each.\n\nIn addition to Davies\u2014a cromulent mid-rotation starter, with nowhere near Darvish\u2019s upside\u2014the Cubs receive four prospects: shortstops Yeison Santana and Reggie Preciado, and outfielders Owen Caissie and Ismael Mena. The oldest of the bunch is Santana, who just celebrated his 20th birthday this month. FanGraphs prospect analyst Eric Longenhagen rates all four prospects with a \u201chigh\u201d level of risk and estimates that three of them won\u2019t reasonably arrive at the MLB level until 2025. So check back in half a decade, or longer, to see how this trade really worked out for the Cubs.\n\n\n\n(This piece is focused on the Padres, but again, the Cubs won their division just last year! Now their rotation ranks 30th in projected 2021 WAR, a smidge behind the Orioles\u2019. With the Ricketts ownership group apparently mandating drastic spending cuts, Theo Epstein got out just in time.)\n\nThe Padres might not be done making winter moves, but the Snell-Darvish double whammy looks like a capstone to a remarkable franchise turnaround. Before 2020, the Padres hadn\u2019t enjoyed a winning season since 2010, or a playoff berth since 2006. Preller\u2019s initial deal-making flurry flopped, costing the franchise young players like Trea Turner, Max Fried, and Yasmani Grandal. But with a rebuilt farm system that gave Preller both promising players and the depth to make trades, a once-in-a-generation trade heist\u2014Petco Park should protect the \u201cJames Shields for Erik Johnson and Fernando Tatis Jr.\u201d fax like the National Archives preserves the Declaration of Independence\u2014and an ownership group willing to spend, not just for Darvish but for free agents Manny Machado and Eric Hosmer as well, the Padres have transformed into a juggernaut in waiting.\n\nSan Diego won the third-most games in the shortened 2020 season, and that lofty showing wasn\u2019t a fluke: The Padres had the second-best run differential in the majors, behind only the Dodgers. They also ranked second in BaseRuns differential, which measures a team\u2019s \u201cexpected\u201d runs based on granular statistics like number of strikeouts and home runs. And they ranked second in projected 2021 WAR before the offseason got underway\u2014but that was with Clevinger, and the Padres were still five wins behind the Dodgers, closer to ninth place than first.\n\nFronting the rotation with two new All-Stars helps close that gap; so does signing the 25-year-old Kim, who hit .306/.397/.523 with 30 home runs and more walks than strikeouts in the KBO last season. A natural shortstop, Kim will slide to second base in the Padres\u2019 infield, giving the team shortstop-caliber defenders at second, short, and third.\n\nAs with any player who hasn\u2019t yet been exposed to a steady diet of MLB fastballs, it\u2019s unclear just how well Kim\u2019s bat will translate. But his age, defensive versatility, and baserunning skill all give him a larger margin for error than, say, ByungHo Park, a KBO masher who couldn\u2019t find his hitting stroke in MLB. Kim\u2019s projection range is understandably wide, with Steamer giving him a modest figure and ZiPS expecting him to produce like an All-Star candidate for the next half-decade.\n\nThe Padres didn\u2019t need Kim; they already had Tatis and Machado on the left side of the infield and 2020 NL Rookie of the Year runner-up Jake Cronenworth to man second base. But why not add more depth and talent when it\u2019s attainable? They\u2019re trying to beat the Dodgers at their own game.\n\nThe reigning World Series champions remain the presumptive favorite, of course, both in their budding rivalry with the Padres and in MLB at large. They might well create separation from San Diego this offseason by signing Trevor Bauer or trading for Francisco Lindor. But unlike some other prospective challengers, the Padres aren\u2019t cowering in the face of a dynasty next door. They\u2019re leaning on all of their resources and exploring all the ways to build a roster\u2014through prospect call-ups, trades, and free-agent signings\u2014to prevent the Dodgers from sitting too comfortably on their throne.\n\nSan Diego fans can only stand to benefit after so many years adrift. Perhaps the most cutting encapsulation of the Padres\u2019 lost decade is a list of their Opening Day starters from that period, following Jake Peavy\u2019s trade at the 2009 deadline.\n\n2010: Jon Garland (career 1.3 bWAR with San Diego)\n\n2011: Tim Stauffer (4.2)\n\n2012 and 2013: Edinson V\u00f3lquez (-1.5)\n\n2014: Andrew Cashner (3.2)\n\n2015: James Shields (2.6)\n\n2016: Tyson Ross (7.2)\n\n2017: Jhoulys Chac\u00edn (2.6)\n\n2018: Clayton Richard (1.1)\n\n2019: Eric Lauer (1.3)\n\nThe Opening Day question now isn\u2019t whether the Padres have an ace, but which one to tap for the start; the 2021 Padres have three legitimate candidates to shoulder the lofty hopes of the franchise and take the mound when a new season begins. That number will rise to four when Clevinger returns; maybe five, if Gore is excellent as promised; or six, if 2020 Opening Day starter Chris Paddack harnesses his talents too.\n\nIn the 2010s, the Padres ranked 29th in total team wins. But they might be the team to beat in the 2020s\u2014or, at least, the team best positioned to wrest that crown from the one team that\u2019s already won a title this decade. They\u2019re not wasting any opportunity to meet that challenge, or fulfill that promise.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Tue Dec 29 04:05:56 +0000 2020", "id": 1343770201452642304, "id_str": "1343770201452642304", "full_text": "It is hysterically funny how much talent the Padres have acquired for so little prospect return in the past 5 months", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 116], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": []}, "source": "<a href=\"http://twitter.com/download/android\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter for Android</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 89553469, "id_str": "89553469", "name": "Michael Baumann", "screen_name": "MichaelBaumann", "location": "South Jersey", "description": "Staff Writer, @ringer. \n@RingerUnion bargaining committee. \nGamecock.

To the hordes of actors toiling in obscurity, this may sound like a good problem to have. Almost six years to the day after the last episode of \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d aired, and after struggling to make the transition from TV icon to movie star, Aaron Paul is starting to see it that way, too. The actor, who became synonymous with his character Jesse Pinkman in Vince Gilligan\u2019s Emmy-winning AMC series, will return to his star-making role this fall in Netflix\u2019s hotly-anticipated \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d movie, \u201cEl Camino.\u201d\n\nAfter a string of failed movie roles, Paul is looking forward to revisiting Jesse. \u201cI was so spoiled at the height of \u2018Breaking Bad,\u2019 I was being offered everything.\u201d Paul told Vulture during a recent interview. His first plum movie roles after \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d including a lead part in the race-car drama \u201cNeed For Speed\u201d and another in Ridley Scott\u2019s \u201cExodus: Gods and Kings,\u201d flopped with critics and audiences.\n\nPopular on Indiewire\n\n\u201cYou do one commercial film that\u2019s not the success they think it\u2019s going to be, and you\u2019re damned,\u201d he added.\n\nAfter a few missed opportunities, including one \u201cmonster, monster hit\u201d that is too painful to name, Paul was ready to revisit Jesse. \u201cThere were some big thorns in my side that I had to let go,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife knew all of this was going on, so when I told her what Vince wanted to do, she threw her arms around me. She knew it was an opportunity for me to spread my wings again.\u201d\n\nWhile details have been kept tightly under wraps, the plot will center around Jesse in the aftermath of the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d series finale. The official synopsis for \u201cEl Camino\u201d reads: \u201cIn the wake of his dramatic escape from captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge some kind of future.\u201d Jonathan Banks recently let slip that he will be making an appearance in the film as his fan favorite character Mike Ehrmantraut, opening the door for the return of Bryan Cranston\u2019s Walter White. Walter\u2019s appearance would undoubtedly have a tremendous emotional impact on Jesse.\n\n\u201cIt was easy to access those emotions, man,\u201d Paul said of returning to the character. \u201cIt was all very much still in me, and it was nice to release those feelings again. \u2026 I look at the world completely differently [since] having my daughter \u2026 I see Jesse as this damaged soul \u2014 as this guy who\u2019s just hurting \u2014 even more now.\u201d\n\nThough Paul didn\u2019t weigh in on the Netflix versus movie theater debate, he seems content with his version of stardom. \u201cI can\u2019t live with that pressure on me, nor will I.

He has a loose, easy simple delivery to repeat (his mechanics). He\u2019s got a really dynamic changeup that he feels comfortable using it any in any count. His breaking ball is going to be firmed up with our pitch-design guys and it\u2019s going to be an effective out pitch also.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees are confident that Way will get better simply by growing into his body, too. He\u2019s currently listed at 200 pounds, but probably can easily put on another 10 to 20 pounds of muscle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s more in the tank with this guy when we get him in our strength and conditioning program\u201a\u201d Oppenheimer said. \u201cThere\u2019s just there\u2019s a lot of room for growth here.\u201d\n\nWay, 20, is well traveled already, as he\u2019s a Mechanicsburg, Pa., native who pitched in North Carolina for Division II Belmont Abbey as a college freshman in 2019 before transferring to Northwest Florida State. Now, he\u2019s expected to sign with the Yankees - the bonus slot for the 129th overall pick is $438,700 - instead of fulfilling his commitment to play next season at LSU, which has one of college baseball\u2019s most prestigious programs.\n\nBefore the coronavirus ended Beck\u2019s 2020 season early, he was dominate for Northwest Florida State, going 5-0 with an 0.67 ERA, 58 strikeouts and nine walks over 40 innings in six outings, five as a starter.\n\n\u201cWe were able to scout Beck quite a bit because they started their season early and they started in Florida,\u201d Oppenheimer said. \u201cThe only thing that we would like to have had happened was to have seen a full season of how he would have held up, but we were getting good evaluations on him.\u201d\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

Megachampion?", "text": "Photo: Jeopardy!/ABC\n\nJust when you entertained the idea that James Holzhauer, the greatest (and most strategic) Jeopardy! champion since Ken Jennings, couldn\u2019t possibly run out of steam and succumb to a defeat at the hands of another contestant\u2019s buzzer, in struts Emma Boettcher to say, Hell no. That\u2019s exactly what happened on Monday\u2019s episode, anyway, when Boettcher was able to defeat Holzhauer in a close match, stopping him short of breaking Jennings\u2019s regular-game earnings record ($2,464,216 to Jennings\u2019s $2,520,700, to be precise.) Boettcher now has the distinction of being the newest inductee into the Game Show Beast-Slayers Club and will continue her run per normal this evening, as if nothing massive just happened.\n\nThis history of Jeopardy! players who\u2019ve defeated a megachampion piqued Vulture\u2019s interest \u2014 so much so we decided to look back at the most memorable instances over the past decade. (We love a good run!) The following results, admittedly, are pretty far from what we expected.\n\nNancy Zerg, who defeated Ken Jennings after a 74-win, $2.5 million streak\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nTotal games won: 1\n\nTotal prize earnings: $15,401\n\nA Realtor from California, Zerg had the distinction of toppling Jeopardy!\u2019s most famous contestant after seven months of his domination \u2014 a feat aided by Jennings getting both Daily Double clues wrong. \u201cI thought, Somebody is going to beat him, and it might as well be me,\u2019\u2019 she later explained. \u201cI watched some of the other players\u2019 attitudes, and they lost the game in the parking garage before they even got to the studio.\u201d Zerg went on to lose her very next game by a significant margin.\n\nVictoria Groce, who defeated David Madden after a 19-win, $430,400 streak\n\nTotal games won: 1\n\nTotal prize earnings: $23,801\n\nThe Georgia musician thwarted Madden\u2019s journey to reach the 20-Something Club, thanks to her careful Final Jeopardy! wager in the Ranks & Titles category. (Fun fact: Madden was a graduate student living in Berlin at the time and pissed off his professors with his long absence.) \u201cI\u2019m genuinely interested in almost everything under the sun,\u201d Madden said about his success. \u201cI\u2019d run through facts in my head to make them stick, sometimes with mnemonic devices.\u201d Groce finished last in her next game.\n\nBrian Loughnane, who defeated Julia Collins after a 20-win, $428,100 streak\n\nPhoto: Jeopardy!/NBC\n\nTotal games won: 1\n\nTotal prize earnings: $24,600\n\nA Final Jeopardy! clue about literature aided Collins\u2019s demise \u2014 she bet it all and lost \u2014 with Loughnane, an investment manager from Massachusetts, sliding in as the victor. He immediately lost his next game, while Collins did a lovely press tour about the show\u2019s girl power. \u201cIf it helps dispel the idea that women aren\u2019t as good Jeopardy! players as men, that would be great,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see women being applauded for being smart.\u201d\n\nMichael Baker, who defeated Matt Jackson after a 13-win, $411,612 streak\n\nTotal games won: 1\n\nTotal prize earnings: $17,201\n\nLate-night shows lost some premium content after Jackson\u2019s defeat: He was known for the slow, creepy smiles he delivered when the camera panned in on him. (Yup, we have a GIF for you.) \u201cIt is pretty hard to wrap my mind around,\u201d Jackson said of his winning streak. \u201cA returning champion finds out pretty quickly that Jeopardy! is actually, under the surface, an endurance contest.\u201d Baker, a travel editor from New York, was eliminated \u2014 sensing a trend here? \u2014 by a close margin in the following game.\n\nScarlett Sims, who defeated Austin Rogers after a 12-win, $411,000 streak\n\nPhoto: Jeopardy!/NBC\n\nTotal games won: 1\n\nTotal prize earnings: $34,201\n\nRogers, a certified-fresh fan favorite, lost to Sims by a mere $51 \u2014 those pantomimes were gone, but definitely not forgotten. \u201cJeopardy! is a game show. Games are fun. There\u2019s this weirdly intense ethos of gravitas applied to Jeopardy!\u201d Rogers told us about his style. \u201cIt\u2019s not a hearing at the Hague. It\u2019s not a session of the NATO joint chiefs. It\u2019s a game show meant to entertain. So why not have fun on it?\u201d The stay-at-home-mom from Tennessee promptly lost in her second game.\n\nDiana Peloquin, who defeated Arthur Chu after an 11-win, $297,200 streak\n\nPhoto: Jeopardy!/NBC\n\nTotal games won: 1\n\nTotal prize earnings: $17,700\n\nChu, who ruffled a few feathers with his unconventional (and often brusque) \u201cbounce\u201d style of game play, was edged out by Peloquin thanks to a Final Jeopardy! clue about the British monarchy. \u201cI was really interested in his playing style. I wanted to engage with that, and I had lots of time to study,\u201d the Maryland law student said after her win. \u201cI really admired his playing style while watching his games, so I was surprised that there was such a backlash to it.\u201d She \u2014 surprise \u2014 didn\u2019t win another game after this.\n\nErin Delaney, who defeated Buzzy Cohen after a nine-win, $164,603 streak\n\nPhoto: Jeopardy!/NBC\n\nTotal games won: 2\n\nTotal prize earnings: $54,999\n\nThe snazziest Jeopardy! dresser in recent memory lost to Delaney, an English professor from California, before he could get to the double-digit-win tier. She credited her victory to hard work and the opportunity to observe Cohen before their face-off. \u201cI was excited to play against him,\u201d she later said. \u201cHe was a great competitor.\u201d Cohen also told us after his run: \u201cThere was definitely a very polarized reaction to me. My defense of myself, I guess, is this is who I am. Short of being in court, I\u2019m always injecting my personality into stuff.\u201d Unlike the previous megachamp conquerors, Delaney earned another round of success, winning two games in total.\n\nMark Japinga, who defeated Ben Ingram after an eight-win, $177k streak\n\nPhoto: Jeopardy!/NBC\n\nTotal games won: 4\n\nTotal prize earnings: $113,600\n\nJapinga, a bona fide Vulture contributor, earned himself the niche title of the most successful contestant to unseat a prominent champion, decisively winning three more games after beating Ingram and his smooth southern drawl. \u201cPeople ask a lot if appearing on Jeopardy! has been a lifelong goal, to which I say, sort of,\u201d Japinga said upon his eventual loss. \u201cI\u2019m not an obsessive viewer by any means. I\u2019ve always enjoyed Jeopardy! and have always been good enough at trivia.\u201d\n\nJelisa Castrodale, who defeated Roger Craig after a six-win, $230,200 streak\n\nTotal games won: 1\n\nTotal prize earnings: $40,399\n\nCastrodale snuck up on Craig during their Final Jeopardy! round, thanks to an impressive wager in a football-centric category. (Easy for her, as she\u2019s a sportswriter.) \u201cIt was like Gladiator,\u201d Castrodale, a North Carolina native, later said. \u201cYou just sit there helpless, like, I\u2019ve got to face this guy.\u201d She didn\u2019t fare as well in her second game, finishing in last place.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2020/11/09/anatomy-of-a-play-how-patrick-mahomes-put-himself-in-motion-on-ferrari-right/", "authors": ["Doug Farrar", "Barry Werner", "November"], "title": "Anatomy of a Play: How Patrick Mahomes put himself in motion on 'Ferrari Right'", "text": "There isn\u2019t much Patrick Mahomes isn\u2019t capable of doing. Make ridiculous sidearm throws all over the field into impossibly tight windows? Check. Throw across his body 50 yards downfield with perfect accuracy? No problem. Run one of the NFL\u2019s most complex offenses like he was born with the playbook? Sure.\n\nBut when was the last time you saw a quarterback use pre-snap motion\u2026 with himself?\n\nAt Touchdown Wire, we\u2019ve written a lot about the benefits of pre-snap motion for an offense (here and here), and the Chiefs have been one of the league\u2019s primary instigators for a long time \u2014 certainly since Mahomes took that offense in hand in 2018. Head coach Andy Reid and offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy already have a crazy quilt of pre-snap motions and deceptions to work enemy defenses, but the play against the Panthers on Sunday that led to a one-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes to Demarcus Robinson with 3:45 left in the first half had a new wrinkle \u2014 Mahomes putting himself in motion pre-snap.\n\nShowtime to Honey Thunder for our first touchdown of the game \ud83d\ude4c #CARvsKC on FOX https://t.co/KPtNkCjo50\n\nThe pre-snap keys are interesting for any defense here. Mahomes, by going in motion, can get a sense of what the defense is going to run (though this close to the end zone, you\u2019re generally getting straight man coverage), and the Panthers had to watch for a direct snap to running back Le\u2019Veon Bell \u2014 we\u2019ve already seen the Chiefs do that kind of thing in Super Bowl LIV.\n\nChiefs really took a play Michigan ran in the 1948 Rose Bowl \ud83d\ude2f @Chiefs https://t.co/VE0gvp0VQV\n\nSo, that sets the front on edge, as well. Always good to get the defense thinking when all the defense wants to do is dictate. You can see how the defenders followed Bell and where they thought Mahomes might be running, and how Mahomes then booted to the right. By that time, the coverage had busted, and Mahomes had a pitch-and-catch to Robinson. It was a crucial play in Kansas City\u2019s 33-31 win.\n\nSo, who was the architect of this bit of twisted genius? Mahomes said after the game that the play was called \u201cFerrari Right,\u201d and Reid said that Mahomes himself was the guy behind the design.\n\n\u201c[Over] the last three weeks Pat\u2019s been messing around with it, so I told him, I said, \u2018We\u2019re going to put it in,\u2019 and he looked at me like I was crazy,\u201d Reid explained, via our sister site, Chiefs Wire. \u201cBut he had been doing it and it looked good, so, I said, \u2018If it looks good, let\u2019s try it,\u2019 and so we tried it. He goes down there during special teams and he was messing around with a couple of things, so we put it in, and it worked.\u201d\n\nThe play started as a way for Mahomes to get warmed up in practice, and then, it became something else altogether.\n\n\u201cYou see me in training camp and before practice, taking snaps with centers, and so obviously, I\u2019m doing formations and stuff like that and I started going in motion,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cAfter that, I had to go to Tom Melvin, our tight ends coach. and ask if it was legal for me to be in motion \u2014 he said [yes], as long as everyone was set. Then after I got that, I took it to special teams and started working with Trav (Travis Kelce) and Tyreek (Hill) on these different plays we could run from it and I had to start throwing little hints to Coach Reid that we needed to try it out, and finally got it in, and it worked out well.\u201d\n\nReceiver Tyreek Hill, who\u2019s often the force multiplier in Kansas City\u2019s motion concepts, was surprised that the play was in the book.\n\n\u201cThe crazy thing is, I really didn\u2019t think that play was going to be put in,\u201d Chiefs WR Tyreek Hill told reporters after the game. \u201cBut it\u2019s Patrick Mahomes, so. There was one day at practice where he was like, \u201910, 10, 10, come over here I\u2019ve got a play for you!\u2019 And I saw him do his counter jet [motion] and I was like, \u2018Bro, what are you doing? Why don\u2019t you just line up and snap the ball?\u2019 But it turned out to be a great play.\u201d\n\nIndeed it did, and one wonders what other manner of trickeration the troika of Reid, Bieniemy, and Mahomes might come up with in this fashion.\n\n\u201cHis creativity \u2014 just him being around Coach Reid,\u201d Hill said, when asked about how Mahomes has expanded his schematic range. \u201cCoach Reid is wearing off on Pat, just the creativity and the ideas that both of them have. It\u2019s just collaborating and EB [Bieniemy] too, EB\u2019s right there in the mix too, so it\u2019s just crazy.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019re going to have something fun after the bye week.\u201d\n\nThe Chiefs do have a Week 10 bye, and they then take on the Raiders on November 22. Which gives Las Vegas defensive coordinator Paul Guenther two weeks to figure out how to keep \u201cFerrari Right\u201d in the garage.\n\nGood luck with that, Coach.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Sun

of Sussex has lost the first stage of her legal battle with the publisher of the Mail on Sunday as the judgement from a preliminary hearing was handed down today.\n\nFollowing the remote hearing on Friday, April 24, it was announced that Justice Warby has ruled in favor of the publisher and struck out parts of Meghan\u2019s claim against them.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for her legal representatives, Schillings, said that the case will continue to move forward and its \"core elements\" have not changed.\n\nThe Duchess is suing Associated Newspapers Limited for the alleged breach of privacy, infringement of copyright, and breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 after it published extracts of a letter she wrote to her father. Court documents logged last month also revealed text messages sent from Meghan and Harry to her father just before their wedding.\n\nJustice Warby\u2019s judgement, released just after midday in the UK today, reads: \u201cI agree that all three categories of allegation should be struck out of the Particulars of Claim, and the Further Information about it. I also agree that passages of the Reply should be struck out.\"\n\nHowever, he continued: \"Some of these conclusions are however without prejudice to the claimant\u2019s right to come back with an application for permission to make amendments that comply with the applicable law and principles.\u201d\n\nMeghan\u2019s privacy lawsuit centers around the publication of a letter written to her father after the royal wedding. WPA Pool Getty Images\n\nHis judgement means that when the case proceeds the court will not consider these parts of the claim: that the Mail on Sunday acted dishonestly and in bad faith, deliberately stirred up conflict between Meghan and her father, and had an agenda of publishing intrusive or offensive stories.\n\nThe judge outlined that some of the arguments were struck out because they were \u201cirrelevant to the purpose for which they are pleaded\u201d and some because they were \u201cinadequately detailed.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the Duchess confirmed that she would not be appealing the decision. A spokesperson for Schillings, who are acting on her behalf in court, said in a statement: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling makes very clear that the core elements of this case do not change and will continue to move forward.\u201d\n\nThe statement also read: \u201cWhilst the Judge recognises that there is a claim for breach of privacy and copyright, we are surprised to see that his ruling suggests that dishonest behaviour is not relevant.\"\n\nIt continued: \"Nonetheless, we respect the Judge's decision as the strong case against Associated will continue to focus on the issue of a private, intimate and hand-written letter from a daughter to her father that was published by The Mail on Sunday.\u201d\n\nIn the final paragraph of his judgement, Justice Warby also left the door open that parts of the case he has struck out could be \u201crevived if they are put in proper form.\u201d\n\nHe wrote: \u201cI do not consider that the allegations struck out on that basis go to the \u201cheart\u201d of the case, which at its core concerns the publication of five articles disclosing the words of, and information drawn from, the letter written by the claimant to her father in August 2018.

The main character, a young girl named Lizzie McGuire, was played by teenage Hilary Duff \u2014 who is in her 30s now.\n\nJust as quickly as the reboot seemed to make the news, though, news broke that Disney+ had halted production. And Duff finally spoke out via Instagram about her true thoughts on the reboot being booted off the streaming service.\n\nHilary Duff | Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images\n\nFans were excited to see McGuire as a woman in her 30s\n\nWhen Lizzie McGuire was on Disney Channel nearly two decades ago, the show followed the life of a pre-teen-to-teenage McGuire, played by Duff, who was navigating the realities of middle school. The show highlighted various real-life problems that young girls go through at that age, such as relationships, friendships, and even the all-important question of when to start wearing a bra.\n\nThe show, which aired in 2001, recently got the green light for a Disney+ reboot \u2014 and fans were ecstatic. As was Duff, who posted photos to Instagram of the first day on set. The original cast members would return, with Duff continuing her role as present-day McGuire. But ultimately, Disney+ shot down the show.\n\nProduction was reportedly halted because Disney+ wanted to remain a family-friendly streaming service\n\nWhen the idea first arose about a reboot, the intention of the director was that the show would exemplify the trials and tribulations of a woman in her 30s. But, of course, not everything that happens to a woman in her 30s is appropriate for young kids. And Disney+ quickly realized that if they wanted to keep their streaming service PG, they needed to trim back what happens on the show. But this would also mean falsely portraying an adult woman as living a life that fit under \u201cthe ceiling\u201d of a more family-friendly rating, which Duff said in her recently released statement.\n\nDuff spoke out and asked for Hulu to take over the show\n\nOn February 28, Duff took to Instagram to express her distaste at the show\u2019s halted production. As sad as she was, though, she felt that she had a \u201cresponsibility\u201d to play a character who portrayed a woman of the same age that McGuire would be today.\n\n\u201cI feel a huge responsibility to honor the fans\u2019 relationship with LIZZIE, who, like me, grew up seeing themselves in her. I\u2019d be doing a disservice to everyone by limiting the realities of a 30 year old\u2019s journey to live under the ceiling of a PG rating,\u201d part of Duff\u2019s statement read. The actress then asked Disney to allow the show to move to Hulu, where the \u201cfamily-friendly\u201d vibe wouldn\u2019t matter as much. Disney has not yet said whether they would consider the move, but for the right price, it might happen \u2014 fingers crossed.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://triblive.com/sports/rays-officially-add-blackhawks-brendan-mckay-who-will-debut-saturday/", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "title": "Rays officially add Blackhawk\u2019s Brendan McKay, who will debut Saturday", "text": "TribLIVE's Daily and Weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need, right to your inbox.\n\nST.

They said one worrisome scenario is hunters dumping parts from an infected animal, which could lead to ravens or other scavengers spreading the disease.\n\nThe disease, which has an incubation period of at least 16 months and often longer, has been detected in eastern Utah, as well as in states including Colorado and Kansas. State Department of Agriculture veterinarian JJ Goicoechea warned earlier this year that it is probably only a matter of time until the disease reaches Nevada, the Las Vegas Sun reports. \"In watching the patterns as they progress through Colorado into Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, up into Montana now, it\u2019s spreading. And it is going to spread into Nevada,\" he said. \u201cWe want to do everything we can. I don't want it to be because of something we did not do.\" (The CDC says it could be possible for the disease to jump to humans, although no such cases have been recorded yet.)\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2019/06/11/samoa-bans-hit-elton-john-biopic-over-gay-sex-scenes/1761034", "authors": [], "title": "Samoa bans hit Elton John biopic over gay sex scenes", "text": "Elton John poses with Taron Egerton at the screening for \u2018Rocketman\u2019 at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France May 16, 2019. \u2014 Reuters pic\n\nAPIA (Samoa), June 11 \u2015 Samoa has banned the blockbuster Elton John biopic Rocketman from cinemas over depictions of gay sex, which remains illegal in the Pacific island nation.\n\nSamoa\u2019s Principal Censor Leiataua Niuapu confirmed the ban to local media this week, saying the film contained too many scenes that were \u201cnot good for public viewing\u201d.\n\nNiuapu told the Samoa Observer that the movie \u201cviolates laws against same-sex marriage and doesn\u2019t go well with cultural and Christian beliefs here\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good story, in that it\u2019s about an individual trying to move on in life,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe (Elton John) went through a difficult family life and managed to move on and become very successful.

An officially licensed Sanrio product. Photo : Mike Fahey\n\nFahey\n\nThis one\u2019s easy. For years my family has been conditioned to the fact that if I want a video game, I buy a video game. If I want hardware, I\u2019ll find a way to afford hardware. I\u2019ve been blessed with the means to get the things I wanted, but there was one piece of hardware that always eluded me: the translucent pink Japanese Hello Kitty Dreamcast.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not that the special-edition console, which came packaged with a pink VMU, keyboard, and a Hello Kitty typing game, was particularly expensive. You can find them on eBay for a couple hundred bucks loose. It\u2019s that as much as I desired the pretty pink thing, I couldn\u2019t justify the purchase. I have several Dreamcasts. I didn\u2019t need another one, no matter how gorgeous it is.\n\nEnter my parents. In 2018, with nothing practical on my Christmas wish list, I suggested they look on eBay for my pink plastic prize. Heavily aided by my spouse (my parents are in their 70s and 80s), they managed to come through, even if they had to do it in two transactions because they got their eBay auctions mixed up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2014, the before times. What even was going on back then? Riley built a computer, was one thing. Photo : Riley MacLeod\n\nRiley\n\nFor my birthday in 2014, a bunch of my friends pooled together some money and gave it to me to build a gaming PC. Prior to that I\u2019d been playing stuff on a gaming laptop that burned itself out really fast, and I replaced it with a machine I could work on but not play games with. It was a really sweet gift\u2014I totally cried\u2014and they even helped me pick out parts and build the whole thing. Having a gaming PC was great for my then-freelance career, because I could play games I couldn\u2019t before, and that definitely helped me land this job, so it\u2019s really been the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s my original NES and a not-my-original, slightly upgraded Atari 800 gifted me by a kind classic gaming friend who knew my nerd origin story. Photo : Alexandra Hall\n\nAlexandra\n\nMy family was friends with two other families we knew through my father\u2019s job. The dad of one family\u2014everyone was hetero!\u2014was always buying the newest tech gear, including video games, and at some point started to gift my fam his hand-me-downs when the latest and greatest sapped his interest in the old and known. His first donation to our clan was an Atari 800 computer, the first game-playing machine I had access to at home. I adored it.\n\n\n\nIt came with 15 or 20 cartridges, mostly games (one was the programming language BASIC). I quickly grew attached to the weird Atari 8-bit versions of Donkey Kong, Robotron 2084, Centipede, Missile Command, Star Raiders (I recall achieving the end-game rating \u201cspace janitor\u201d), and the ultimate secret gem, River Rescue. I even played a lot of Ms. Pac-Man, a game I don\u2019t care for today, because I was utterly fascinated by anything and everything that excited the beautifully glowing phosphors of a TV screen.\n\n\n\nThat was it: I was officially a video game kid. Around 15 years later, this kind man\u2019s final tech gift\u2014this time to me directly\u2014would be his old Neo Geo AES console, which reeked of cigarettes. It was a rad surprise but the smell was so unbearable I traded it away for a copy of, weirdly, PC Engine Tatsujin. (Which, even more weirdly, seems to be worth more than an AES now.)\n\n\n\nMy other best gaming gift must be the NES. Despite my Atari love affair I was slow to cotton on to there being other, newer video game systems. In the summer of 1987 or 1988 I stayed with some cousins and they had a NES along with a dozen of the common early games: Kung-Fu, Super Mario Bros., Double Dribble, Ice Hockey, etc. It was the closest thing I\u2019ve experienced to love at first sight. (I remember not liking Punch-Out!! at first, though.) Upon returning home I\u2019m sure I was insufferable, all \u201cFriendship ended with ATARI, now NINTENDO is my best friend.\u201d My beleaguered parents soon relented and another Nintendo zombie was born.\n\nAs for worst gaming gift, one time I asked my grandmother for NES Friday the 13th, one of the more famously bad games for the system, after I had already rented it once. Kids are inexplicable sometimes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDramatization. Photo : Luca9257 ( Shutterstock )\n\nAri\n\nWhat kid wants snow boots for a birthday present? It\u2019s a gift rooted in practicality, without an ounce of fun. Maine (that\u2019s where I grew up) is known for its seriously punishing winters. A walk to the school bus in the middle of December could easily give a kid frostbite, especially if that kid is a petulant child who prefers paper-thin Vans slip-ons over more seasonable footwear.\n\n\n\nSo, yeah, for my something-th birthday (nice try; telling you the exact number will instantly carbon-date me), my mother bought me snow boots. Boots. For a something-th grader. A practical gift, sure, but not exactly a cool one.\n\nTurns out, my mother tucked a copy each of the two new Pok\u00e9mon versions, Gold and Silver, into each boot. Now that was cool. Less cool was the condition that, once I chose one, I\u2019d have to commit and play it all the way through to the Elite Four before starting the other. In other words\u2014and this is only dawning on me now as a result of hindsight\u2019s dual-edged power\u2014my mother apparently harbored dormant dreams of being a Pok\u00e9mon professor. This ruled, obviously, as I was eventually able to put together a roster with both Lugia and Ho-Oh on it, which I summarily used to crush every Pok\u00e9mon-playing kid in school. And I didn\u2019t get frostbite walking there, either.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI roll my eyes when people say the Xbox controller was big. Like bro, have you seen Sega. Photo : Frederic J. Brown ( Getty Images )\n\nZack\n\nIt\u2019s easy: The best gaming gift I ever got was a Sega Genesis. I remember at the time thinking this was the best, most amazing console ever. I didn\u2019t have gaming magazines or YouTube to tell me otherwise. This Sega Genesis console in my home was amazing and I could play a Power Rangers game on it. ( That was also the first game I ever beat, by the way. )\n\n\n\nHowever, what I didn\u2019t know was that my parents were being very smart and frugal. Gaming back in the mid-\u2019 90s, like today, was very expensive. So my folks would buy my brother and I older consoles and games. We didn\u2019t care. They were new to us. And it saved my parents a lot of money, which was good because we often didn\u2019t have a lot to spare. It also means I grew up playing stuff on the Atari 2600 and NES, even though I was born years after those consoles were relevant or new.\n\n\n\nAs I grew up this strategy would eventually become unsustainable, as I started learning more about the hobby and asking for newer consoles and games. But for various reasons, I never got another Christmas-gift console after that Genesis. So it holds a special place in my heart and is easily my best gaming gift ever.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe still has the cart! It looks very festive here. Photo : Ethan Gach\n\nEthan\n\nThere are so many it\u2019s hard to pick. In 1998 I got a magenta Game Boy Color and Pok\u00e9mon Yellow. I was ecstatic. Finally my own handheld to sit and play games alone in whatever little corner of the world I wanted. The following year my family bought a Nintendo 64 and I got The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. A couple years after that, in a feat of pure magic, my brothers and I somehow got both a PS2 and a GameCube in the same year. One Christmas, two systems. Last year my brother bought me Kartia for the PS1, complete with the jewel case and booklet. I hadn\u2019t played it in decades. It was a delight just to hold it.\n\n\n\nBut my favorite gaming gift of all came back in 1995. I think it was the year we got a Super Nintendo. My parents handed me a big package, too big to be a video game. It looked like it might be clothes. I half-heartedly tore the wrapping paper to reveal a black box with a big yellow starfish on it. \u201cEarthB ound.\u201d Earth-what? I had no idea what it was. My parents picked it up on clearance from the nearby BEST department store that had gone out of business. The sticker said $19.99.\n\nEventually I thumbed through the giant guidebook it came wit h . I started playing later that day. I scratched and sniffed the scratch \u2018n\u2019 sniff cards that came in the package. A monkey chewing bubble gum smelled sweet; a dog on fire smelled like thrown-up chili. Over the days and weeks ahead I slowly came to know what EarthBound really was, and it\u2019s been with me ever since...the cartridge at least. The box and everything else that came with it was lost long ago. At one point I cut everything up to make collages to hang on my wall. I lost those too. Maybe one day they\u2019ll make their way back to me.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow About You?", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/crime-law/2019/10/29/rapist-child-molester-was-accidentally-released-prison-manhunt-is-underway-find-him/", "authors": ["Brittany Shammas", "General Assignment Reporter"], "title": "A child rapist was accidentally released from prison.

It was also the phone\u2019s signature feature. The phone featured an all-screen display like no other device, and the clones never came close to replicating it. But it also had that partial bezel at the top that accommodates the most sophisticated smartphone authentication system out there \u2014 also something the clones never got right. With the iPhone 11, we\u2019re expecting a similar design compromise thanks to all the leaks we\u2019ve seen so far this year, and a brand new set of CAD designs that made their way online seem to give further credence to these rumors.\n\niPhone fans who\u2019re already considering their next iPhone upgrade already know what I\u2019m talking about: the camera module on the back that will house three camera lenses on the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Max, and two lenses on the iPhone 11R or whatever they end up calling the iPhone XR\u2019s successor.\n\nImage Source: SlashLeaks\n\nPosted on SlashLeaks these images show the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Max, and iPhone XR CAD designs. We\u2019re looking at phones that look a lot like their predecessors when it comes to the screen design. We\u2019re looking at displays with notches for Face ID on all three phones and minimal, symmetrical bezels.\n\nImage Source: SlashLeaks\n\nThe only thing that changes is the camera design on the back. The camera bump is getting a lot bigger on the iPhone 11 phones, as the extra lenses will take up additional space. The camera module, with its square shape, looks a lot like what Huawei did with the Mate 20 Pro last year, although that triple-lens camera was placed in the middle of the phone\u2019s top half.\n\nApple is sticking with the left corner for the camera module, a decision that has a lot to do with the internal space available for the cameras.\n\nImage Source: SlashLeaks\n\nWhile some people may not like the size of that camera bump, or how Apple placed those camera lenses, it\u2019s the bigger picture that counts. Apple made dual-cam phones popular and convinced other smartphone vendors to push the number of rear-lenses to as many as five. If the iPhone maker is moving to triple-cam sensors on the iPhone 11 phones, it has good reasons to do so. And we should expect Apple to explain all the new camera features coming to the iPhone 11 thanks to the extra lens. The same goes for the iPhone 11R, which should see several upgrades of its own, in spite of rocking a dual-lens shooter.\n\nTo deliver those features, Apple needs that camera bump, and it needs for it to have a square shape. It can\u2019t reduce the thickness of the cameras for the time being, and it doesn\u2019t favor vertical triple-lens cameras, as seen on Huawei flagships \u2014 and soon on the Galaxy Note 10.\n\nIn other words, you\u2019ll get used to the new iPhone camera design and learn to live with it, just as you did with the notch. And these multi-lens cameras will be the iPhone 11\u2019s signature feature.\n\nOn a related note, Google is going forward with a similar design for the Pixel 4\u2019s rear camera, which will only have two lenses. Like Apple, Google must have a good reason for choosing this particular design compromise.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-loan-idUSKBN1ZJ27T", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "title": "Boeing seeks to borrow $10 billion or more amid 737 MAX crisis: source", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing Co (BA.N) is in talks with banks about borrowing $10 billion or more amid rising costs for the U.S. planemaker after two crashes involving its 737 MAX jetliner, a source told Reuters on Monday.\n\nCNBC first reported the news on Monday, citing sources that Boeing has so far secured at least $6 billion from banks and is talking to other lenders for more contributions.\n\nA source confirmed the talks to Reuters, but it was still not clear how much Boeing would seek to raise and whether it would pursue the selling of new bonds.

The country quickly came up with a variety of tactics, including widespread quarantining and aggressive contact tracing. It has also won praise for its transparency in dealing with the crisis from the World Health Organization and the CDC.\n\nPrime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc recently characterized Vietnam's efforts as the \"spring general offensive of 2020,\" a reference to the 1968 Tet Offensive that many claim helped turn the tide of the Vietnam War.\n\nTens of thousands have been put in quarantine camps. By the end of March, Vietnam had banned all international and domestic flights. The government locked down the country on April 1. State-run media say the current social distancing and stay-at-home orders are to be extended for at least another week.\n\nThose who break the rules in this one-party Communist state are treated harshly. One man was jailed on a nine-month sentence for failing to wear a mask.\n\nStreets normally buzzing with motorcycles and cars are almost empty in most large cities.

It is, somehow, the first one of these games I\u2019ve ever played.\n\n\n\nI don\u2019t how or why that is\u2014it mixes Civilization\u2019s 4X with XCOM\u2019s tactical battles, and those are very much my things\u2014but it is what it is, and so unlike most other impressions of the game you\u2019ll read this week, this one\u2019s coming from someone who has recently played a lot of games like Planetfall, but none of its predecessors.\n\nPlanetfall is actually a little different from other Age of Wonders games, in that it\u2019s a sci-fi spinoff of a traditionally fantasy series, but the gist of the experience is the same. You build cities, you explore a big map, you research stuff and you send armies off into the wilds to fight stuff.\n\nWhat sets Age of Wonders apart from similar games though are two things. The first is the way combat is resolved. Rather than just stacking all involved units together and letting the numbers crunch their way to a result, Planetfall lets you take control, deploying your army on a small but serious tactical battlefield, with features like cover, overwatch and loads of different types of attacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like XCOM only on a smaller scale, as you control less units, have less tactical options at your disposal, levels are much smaller and battles tend to wrap up pretty quickly (which is for the best, since you don\u2019t want every single encounter in a big strategy game to drag on). One cool consequence of this though is that you can really go to town upgrading your heroes and units with gear, then see it translate directly to results on the battlefield.\n\nThat theme of \u201csmaller, faster\u201d leads me to the second major point of difference with Age of Wonders (or at least this instalment), and that\u2019s its speed overall. While you can of course adjust some settings pre-game, for the most part Planetfall is played at a relatively breakneck pace, as everything from unit movement to the speed at which your cities grows is definitely not fucking around.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile you can just fire up a planet and play a regular game of 4X strategy, Planetfall also has a bunch of campaign missions with stories that flesh out the events of its world. I didn\u2019t really dig any of them, though, as the structure of the game doesn\u2019t exactly lend itself to interesting and worthwhile diversions.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe option of having them is nice however, especially since they flesh out the character and personality of each faction, some of whom are amazing. The Amazons, bio-engineering warriors who ride laser-shooting dinosaurs into battle, are a particular highlight, but most others outside the vanilla humans are fairly interesting and unique as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow that I\u2019ve finally got an Age of Wonders under my belt, I liked it! I was at first a bit underwhelmed, especially at the campaign and the fact it felt like the game\u2019s design was half-assing it, and that I\u2019d get a better 4X and/or tactical experience by going and playing something specific like Civ or Fire Emblem.\n\nBut over time, as I played out some larger scenarios and explored the nuances of each of the armies, it started to grow on me. I appreciated the way I could actually fight out the battles I wanted direct control over, and will now be using some of Planetfall\u2019s factions as a gold standard (right up there with the Endless games) for strategy games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBasically, instead of comparing the aspects of Planetfall to superior standalone games, I started settling into the series own particular charms, and am now going to dig back through the Age of Wonders series and see what else I\u2019ve been missing out on.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://abc7.com/entertainment/placido-domingo-resigns-as-la-opera-general-director/5585530/", "authors": [], "title": "Placido Domingo resigns as general director of Los Angeles Opera amid sexual harassment firestorm", "text": "LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- In the face of sexual harassment accusations by as many as 20 women, Placido Domingo resigned Wednesday as general director of the Los Angeles Opera.In a statement Domingo sent to the L.A.

Though, don\u2019t get too excited; you\u2019ll only be able to get your hands on one if you\u2019re part of AT&T\u2019s developer program, or are an AT&T Business customer.\n\nThe 5G-ready phone, which first debuted last month for Verizon subscribers who live in cities that support its 5G service, will cost business users $999. It will also be made available to developers for free at AT&T\u2019s Shape conference in Los Angeles on June 22nd. Today\u2019s announcement makes makes no mention of when consumers will be able to get their hands on Samsung\u2019s phone, or how much it will cost when, or if, it does. It\u2019s possible that the Galaxy Note 10 could be first 5G-ready device to be publicly available for all AT&T customers, since it\u2019s rumored to support both mmWave and sub-6 spectrum.\n\nIn an unusual moment of correctly setting expectations, AT&T mentions in its release that business users and developers will only be able to experience 5G in \u201cvery limited parts\u201d of AT&T\u2019s first batch of cities. As we saw during our hands on with the S10 5G in Chicago, mmWave spectrum on Verizon\u2019s network is quite limited, indeed, though it\u2019s also very capable under the right circumstances. AT&T apparently just needs a few beta testers to make sure that it\u2019s on the right track.\n\nThe Verge\u2019s Chris Welch tested it out and saw gigabit download speeds, which is a boon for downloading a bunch of videos very quickly. Good as these results are, they hinge completely on being in line-of-sight with a 5G node.\n\nDownloaded Iron Man 2 from Prime Video at \"best\" quality in 90 seconds. You can see here that Verizon's network occasionally fell back to 4G LTE. I'm right across the street from the 5G node. https://t.co/TAh2YgmzwD\n\nUntil the S10 5G is made more widely available, the only \u201c5G\u201d devices AT&T customers have access to are ones that support the carrier\u2019s misleadingly-named \u201c5Ge\u201d service, which is really just LTE Advanced.

Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.PreventionThere is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.Clean your hands oftenWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.For information specific to healthcare, see CDC\u2019s Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings.Avoid close contactAvoid close contact with people who are sickPut distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in your community. This is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.Stay home if you're sickStay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Learn what to do if you are sick.Cover coughs and sneezesCover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.Throw used tissues in the trash.Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.Clean and disinfectClean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.If surfaces are dirty, clean them: Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/celebrate-twin-peaks-day-with-deals-with-these-twin-peaks-boxed-set-deals", "authors": ["Seth Macy"], "title": "Celebrate Twin Peaks Day With Deals With These Twin Peaks Boxed Set Deals", "text": "Today is unofficially \"Twin Peaks Day,\" marking the anniversary of the fictional crime that set off one of television's most-loved cult classic series in 1990.\n\nTwin Peaks Day Deals\n\nTo celebrate Twin Peaks Day, Amazon is offering discounts on the complete series and Fire Walk With Me, the Twin Peaks movie.\n\nDon't see the deals below?

A former federal prosecutor, Powell rose to become a close adviser to Trump in the closing days of his presidency, meeting with him repeatedly as he mounted increasingly desperate attempts to overturn the outcome of an election he lost by more than 7 million votes.\n\nPowell could not be reached for comment. But after the voting machine company wrote to her last month threatening a suit, she wrote on social media that she would be \"retracting nothing We have #evidence They are #fraud masters!\"\n\nThe Dominion lawsuit lands just as those who were persistently pushing false election fraud claims have seen intensifying blowback on multiple fronts. Attorney Lin Wood, who partnered with Powell on several of the lawsuits, had his Twitter account permanently banned from the social media platform \"for violations of the Twitter Rules,\" a Twitter spokesperson confirmed to ABC News on Friday. Wood could not be reached by ABC News at his law firm for comment.\n\nRudy Giuliani, another lawyer central to the campaign by Trump allies to push bogus claims about the election, is facing new scrutiny for his comments calling for \"combat\" during the Jan. 6 rally that precipitated the violent insurrection at the U.S. Capitol that left five people dead.\n\nGiuliani defended his comments on social media, saying his \"cause is to obtain an honest vote and to end voter fraud before it becomes a permanent tactic of the enabled and media protected Democrat Party.\"\n\nFueling the furor at the rally were debunked theories of a rigged election. That included the false claims about Dominion voting machines that were pushed relentlessly in courts, on social media, and in Trump's public remarks as part of the effort to overturn the election results. In its 124-page complaint, Dominion details how the theories spread like wildfire in conservative news outlets and on social media. In multiple instances, Trump tweeted out theories and reports about the company to his 88 million followers.\n\n\"Although Powell assured the public during television and radio appearances that her claims were backed by 'evidence,' Powell's 'evidence' included declarations from a motley crew of conspiracy theorists, con artists, armchair 'experts,' and anonymous sources who were judicially determined to be 'wholly unreliable,'\" Dominion wrote in its complaint.\n\nSome of Powell's most far-fetched theories alleged the company was created in Venezuela by deceased dictator Hugo Chavez, the complaint said.\n\nDominion wrote in its complaint that as a result of the defamatory falsehoods peddled by Powell -- in concert with like-minded allies and media outlets who were determined to promote a false preconceived narrative -- Dominion's founder, Dominion's employees, Georgia's governor, and Georgia's secretary of state have been harassed and have received death threats, and Dominion has suffered enormous harm.\n\nThe suit marks the start of what could be an onslaught of litigation against the president and his allies, in response to their aggressive attempt to overturn the results of the November election.\n\nIn recent weeks, Dominion has sent formal letters to over a dozen others, including Giuliani, White House Counsel Pat Cippilone, and Fox News, asking them to retract their statements and preserve documents in preparation for \"imminent\" litigation.\n\nSome conservative outlets, including Fox News and Newsmax, in recent weeks had begun airing retractions to walk back their earlier reports on Dominion as the threat loomed. Powell, though, said she would \"double down\" on her claims, and continued to push those conspiracies during TV interviews and on social media.\n\nDominion has also not ruled out suing Trump himself for his role in pushing the theories about the company.\n\n\"We are looking very deliberately at the statements and actions of everyone who has been involved in talking about Dominion. No one has been ruled out,\" Tom Clare, the attorney for Dominion, said Friday during a call with reporters.\n\nABC News' Lucien Bruggeman and Ali Dukakis contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/blake-shelton-worst-decision-the-voice", "authors": ["Andy Sahadeo"], "title": "Blake Shelton on his worst 'Voice' call: 'Can't think of a dumber decision'", "text": "Blake Shelton is opening up about the worst decision he\u2019s ever made on \u201cThe Voice.\u201d\n\nOn Monday\u2019s episode of the popular singing competition, Shelton took a humble dig at himself when addressing teen pop singer Joana Martinez.\n\nBLAKE SHELTON SAYS GWEN STEFANI ROMANCE IS A 'HEAD-SCRATCHER'\n\nMartinez, who was initially a member of Shelton\u2019s team before defecting to Gwen Stefani\u2019s, performed a rendition of Selena\u2019s \u201cDreaming of You\u201d that made Shelton come clean about his biggest mistake on the show so far.\n\n\u201cJoana, I can't think of a dumber decision I've made in the history of this show than letting you go from my team.

The Beats Powerbeats Pro have the same H1 wireless chip, which makes them just as easy to pair with an iPhone, and just as responsive to \u201cHey Siri\u201d hands-free commands, and those are usually $50 cheaper than the new AirPods Pro.

Ballard\u2019s wife, Mara, reported the episode the next day. Nathan Ballard, 51, declined to make a statement to investigators and was placed under arrest on Oct. 20, according to the Napa County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nHe was released on $75,000 bail.\n\nIn a statement to The Chronicle, Nathan Ballard said he\u2019s spent his career in crisis communications \u201cfighting on behalf the wrongfully accused, and now for the first time I really know what it feels like to be in their shoes.

He has not yet entered a plea.\n\nBallard has for years been a prominent public relations specialist, with clients including the Golden State Warriors, the Democratic National Committee and the California Democratic Party. He was Newsom\u2019s communications director when Newsom was mayor of San Francisco.\n\nMara Ballard, who was referred to by sheriff\u2019s officials as the \u201cadult victim,\u201d told investigators that the episode transpired after Nathan Ballard had consumed a large amount of alcohol and marijuana.\n\nShe alleged that Nathan Ballard charged at her and pushed her with both hands in her upper chest, and caused her to hit her head on the glass door, according to Napa County Sheriff spokesman Henry Wofford.\n\nNathan Ballard then stumbled and fell to the ground. The fall caused Ballard to injure his nose and forehead, \u201ccausing him to bleed,\u201d Wofford said, quoting a deputy\u2019s report. Ballard then grabbed a pillow and lay on top of the pillow with the 4-year-old girl underneath, the report states.\n\n\u201cAccording to the victim, Ballard was either unaware of what he was doing or knew he was trying to hurt the child victim,\u201d Wofford said. \u201cShe went onto say that Ballard seemed like he was trying to hurt and harm the child victim.\u201d\n\nWhen the investigator asked the adult victim whether Ballard was attempting to smother or suffocate the child, the victim said it was \u201ca combination,\u201d Wofford said.\n\n\u201cNate is a well-respected professional and a member of the bar with a spotless ethical record. He has no criminal history,\u201d Brass said. \u201cIn his 51 years, Nate has never been accused of, arrested for, nor charged with any crime until Mara made these unsubstantiated allegations against him.\u201d\n\nPublic records show Mara Ballard filed for a domestic violence restraining order on Oct. 19, two days after the alleged incident. She filed for divorce in Marin County on Oct. 23.\n\nBrass added that his client \u201cknows that he is not perfect, but he is facing his own challenges head-on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter nearly eight years of continuous sobriety, Nate resumed drinking in April, after his father died,\u201d Brass said. \u201cHe is now clean and sober again, and he is currently in a residential recovery program to deal with his drinking problem in a responsible, comprehensive manner.\n\nMara Ballard\u2019s attorney, Amanda Bevins, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMegan Cassidy and Phil Matier are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

Unemployment benefits, eviction protections and other emergency aid, including smaller $600 checks, are at risk. Trump's refusal of the $900 billion package, which is linked to $1.4 trillion government funds bill, could spark a federal shutdown at midnight Monday.\"We're not going to let the government shut down, nor are we going to let the American people down,\" said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the majority leader.The optics appear terrible for Republicans, and the outgoing president, as the nation suffers through the worst holiday season many can remember. Families are isolated under COVID precautions and millions of American households are devastated without adequate income, food or shelter. The virus death toll of 327,000-plus is rising.Trump is ending his presidency much the way he started it - sowing confusion and reversing promises all while contesting the election and courting a federal shutdown over demands his own party in Congress will not meet.The congressional Republican leaders have been left almost speechless by Trump's year-end scorching of their work.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy helped negotiate the year-end deal, a prized bipartisan compromise, that won sweeping approval this week in the House and Senate after the White House assured GOP leaders that Trump supported it.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin boasted that the $600 checks all sides had agreed to for Americans would be in the mail in a week.Instead, Washington is now hurtling toward a crisis with COVID aid about to collapse, as the president is at his Mar-a-Lago club. He has been lashing out at GOP leaders for refusing to join his efforts to overturn the election that Joe Biden won when the Electoral College votes are tallied in Congress on Jan. 6.\"The best way out of this is for the president to sign the bill,\" Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said Thursday. \"And I still hope that's what he decides.\"Racing to salvage the year-end legislation, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Mnuchin are in talks on options.Democrats will recall House lawmakers to Washington for a vote Monday on Trump's proposal, with a roll call that would put all members on record as supporting or rejecting the $2,000 checks. They are also considering a Monday vote on a stop-gap measure to at least avert a federal shutdown. It would keep the government running until Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20. Lawmakers will also be asked to override Trump's veto of a must-pass Defense bill.After presiding over the short House session, an exasperated Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., decried the possibility that the COVID assistance may collapse.\"It is Christmas Eve, but it is not a silent night. All is not calm. For too many, nothing is bright,\" she said on Capitol Hill.A town hall she hosted the night before \"had people crying, people terrified of what is going to happen,\" she said. One father recently told her he had to tell his children there would be no Santa Claus this year.The president's push to increase direct payments for most Americans from $600 to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for couples drives support from Democrats but splits the GOP with a politically difficult test of their loyalty to the president.Republican lawmakers traditionally balk at the big spending, never fully embracing Trump's populist approach. Many have opposed larger $2,000 checks as too costly and poorly targeted.On a conference call Wednesday House Republican lawmakers complained that Trump threw them under the bus, according to one Republican on the private call and granted anonymity to discuss it. Most had voted for the package and they urged GOP leaders to hit the cable news shows to explain its benefits, the person said.Yet the president has found common ground with Democrats, particularly leading liberals who support the $2,000 payments as the best way to help struggling Americans. Democrats only settled for the lower number to compromise with Republicans.Even if the House is able to approve Trump's $2,000 checks on Monday, that measure would likely die in the GOP-controlled Senate, which is due back in session on Tuesday.The president's unpredictable demands are creating more Trump-related headaches for Georgia GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who are fighting for their political lives - and for continued GOP control of the Senate - in a pair of Jan. 5 Georgia run-off elections. They are being forced to choose whether to back or buck Trump, potentially angering voters on all sides.The clash Thursday unfolded as the Democratic-controlled House convened for a routine pro forma session, which had been scheduled before Trump's sudden moves, when lawmakers anticipated no business being conducted.Instead, the 12-minute House session morphed into a procedural brawl as Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, sought the unanimous approval of all House members to pass the bill with Trump's proposal. GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, who was not present in the nearly-empty chamber, refused.House Republicans then tried, and failed, to win unanimous approval of their own proposal to revisit routine foreign aid funding, which Trump had cited as one of his key objections to the overall spending package.The year-end package Trump railed against as a \"disgrace\" is the product of months of work. It would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters and money for schools. Money is included for health care providers and to help with COVID vaccine distribution. Trump took aim at foreign aid funds in the package he has agreed to in the past and asked for in his yearly budget.The final text of the more than 5,000-page bill required days to be compiled but Pelosi announced Thursday that it was completed and being sent to the White House for Trump's signature.The year-end timing complicates the schedule ahead. Even if Trump doesn't formally veto the package, he could allow it to expire with a \"pocket veto\" at the end of the congressional session.The Senate cleared the huge relief package Monday by a 92-6 vote after the House approved it by 359-53. Those votes totals would be enough to override a veto should Trump decide to take that step.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/bar-security-guard-shoots-kills-customer-closing-time/story?id=68881531", "authors": ["Abc News", "Jon Haworth", "February", "Min Read"], "title": "Bar security guard shoots and kills customer at closing time after altercation", "text": "Bar security guard shoots and kills customer at closing time after altercation \"Why did you kill my friend?

More than one of them has played a major role in pushing the Biden administration to appoint Black women to key positions in recent weeks.\n\nFormer Hillary Clinton adviser Minyon Moore, has emerged as something of a gatekeeper in the Biden transition, serving as a point of contact for Black organizers and helping usher women of color into key roles in Harris\u2019s office and beyond.\n\nEarlier this week, the transition team announced that two more Black women, Symone Sanders and Ashley Etienne, would serve as Harris\u2019s spokeswoman and communications director, respectively. Sanders was courted by more than a handful of top Democrats as they launched presidential campaigns last year, and her pairing with Harris gives the Vice President-elect (and potential 2024 hopeful) one of the party\u2019s more prominent, up-and-coming media envoys. Etienne served as a trusted adviser to both President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and she has established a reputation as a savvy behind-the-scenes operator.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAdding Flournoy to an office including Etienne and Sanders signals a desire to surround Harris with Washington experience. Well-connected among California\u2019s political powerbrokers and hardened by the state\u2019s rough-and-tumble Democratic politics, Harris is still relatively new to Washington. She had served about three years in the Senate when she joined the Democratic ticket, and she lacks the sprawling Washington roots that people like Biden had cultivated over decades.\n\nThose close to Harris expected her former Senate and Campaign Chief of Staff Kosoglu to take the a major role in the Office of the Vice President, and she will do so as Harris\u2019s primary policy adviser. Kosoglu became Harris\u2019s Deputy Chief of Staff when Harris first joined the Senate in 2016 and has moved up the ranks of Harris\u2019s inner circle in the years since.\n\nThat circle has remained small as Harris, who aides have described as slow to trust, has jumped from fresh-faced Senator to Vice President-elect. She will now be surrounded by operatives with lengthy Washington tenures, but little history with Harris herself.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFlournoy, Sanders, Etienne and others will now help Harris navigate what will likely be one of the more high-profile vice presidencies in recent history.\n\nActivists from a variety of communities that have never been represented in that executive office hope she will use the job differently than many of her predecessors who served more as team players than agents of change. Women, Black leaders, and many others all see the potential for Harris to break away from destructive norms at the highest levels of government.\n\nShe will also be inaugurated as the understudy to a 79-year-old president who described himself as a \u201ctransitional\u201d figure, cast by Republicans as Democrats\u2019 heir apparent to the presidential throne.

However, this study shows that baby bees can also feel the effects of the contaminated food brought back to the colony, making them poorer at performing tasks later in life.\n\nLead researcher Dr. Richard Gill, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: \"Bee colonies act as superorganisms, so when any toxins enter the colony, these have the potential to cause problems with the development of the baby bees within it.\n\n\"Worryingly in this case, when young bees are fed on pesticide-contaminated food, this caused parts of the brain to grow less, leading to older adult bees possessing smaller and functionally impaired brains; an effect that appeared to be permanent and irreversible.\n\n\"These findings reveal how colonies can be impacted by pesticides weeks after exposure, as their young grow into adults that may not be able to forage for food properly. Our work highlights the need for guidelines on pesticide usage to consider this route of exposure.\"\n\nThe team, who published their results today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, used detailed micro-CT scans to gain unprecedented insights into the development of bee brains under the effects of pesticide exposure.\n\nThe colony was provided with a nectar substitute spiked with a class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, some of which are restricted within the EU but used widely across the globe. Once the young emerged as adults from their pupae, their learning ability was tested after three days and after 12 days, and some went on to have their brains imaged using micro-CT technology at the Natural History Museum.\n\nBumblebee foraging on a flower. Credit: Tara Cox / Imperial College London\n\nThese results were compared with young from colonies that were fed no pesticides, and those that were fed pesticides only once they had emerged as an adult.\n\nBees that were fed pesticides when they were developing as larvae showed significantly impaired learning ability compared to those that were not. The researchers tested this by seeing if the bees could learn to associate a smell with a food reward, scoring how many times out of ten each successfully performed the task.\n\nThe researchers scanned the brains of close to 100 bees from the different colonies and found that those who had been exposed to pesticides also had a smaller volume of an important part of the insect brain, known as the mushroom body.\n\nThe mushroom body is known to be involved in learning ability in insects, and poor performance on the learning task correlated with smaller mushroom body volume. This supports the suggestion that smaller mushroom body volume associated with pesticide exposure is the cause of the bees' poor performance.\n\nBees that were exposed to pesticides during larval development but not as adults showed similar learning impairment and mushroom body volume reduction when tested at both three and 12 days as an adult. This suggests that at least within the unexposed nine days they were adults, the effects of larval exposure could not be overcome, pointing to a potentially permanent effect.\n\nLead author of the study Dr. Dylan Smith, from the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial, said: \"There has been growing evidence that pesticides can build up inside bee colonies. Our study reveals the risks to individuals being reared in such an environment, and that a colony's future workforce can be affected weeks after they are first exposed.\n\n\"Bees' direct exposure to pesticides through residues on flowers should not be the only consideration when determining potential harm to the colony. The amount of pesticide residue present inside colonies following exposure appears to be an important measure for assessing the impact on a colony's health in the future.\"\n\nThe team previously pioneered the use of micro-CT to scan bee brains, and with this study have shown how the technology can be used to test ecologically applied questions that require measuring tiny but important differences in size and shape.\n\nExplore further The more pesticides bees eat, the more they like them", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://rolltidewire.usatoday.com/2020/12/10/sec-commissioner-greg-sankey-will-address-media-for-significant-announcement-later-today-alabama-football/", "authors": ["Clint Lamb", "Aj Spurr", "Bryan Manning", "December"], "title": "Greg Sankey will address media for 'significant announcement' at 6 pm", "text": "Alabama is the face of the SEC.

Probably not.

However, Huawei isn\u2019t the only the company feeling the heat of the trade standoff. US companies are also reeling from the effects. For instance, Apple is already considering moving the production of its key products out of China, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.\n\nHewlett-Packard (HP) and Dell (DELL) have also hinted at the possibility of moving production to other countries. GoPro (GPRO) has already moved production of its US-bound cameras to Mexico to avoid the threat of trade tariffs.\n\nThe standoff between the US and China could also take a toll on Google Android.

Custom $400 wheels aside, it's laughable that that makes headlines. Here's the truth. For a workstation, that's nothing; for example, you can gear up HP's top-end Z8 G4 with dual 28-core Xeons, dual Nvidia 32GB Quadro GV100s, 22TB SSD and more for $107,000 without breaking a sweat.\n\nIn fact, Apple's configuration prices are right in line with typical industry ones. And remember -- those are only the options Apple offers in its Mac Pro system configurator. Toss in three HDX accelerators for Avid Pro Tools and that adds another $13,000 or so, for example.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Apple's Mac Pro maxes out at over $50,000, Microsoft...\n\nBut Apple's one-size-fits-all approach poses drawbacks. On the low end, $6,000 is a lot to pay for an entry-level model, especially with a 256GB SSD and AMD Radeon Pro 580X. That size drive can hold a handful of pro graphics applications and that's probably about it. You should definitely think about upping to 1TB for $400.\n\nAnd in a system like this, the Radeon Pro 580X, with its two-generations-old architecture, is essentially the equivalent of integrated graphics. You may want to wait until the Radeon Pro W5700X options become available, because if you really just want current graphics, bumping one step up to the Radeon Pro Vega II to the tune of $2,400 is kind of silly. Though Apple hasn't released pricing for the 5700-series card, based on existing prices for the unAppleified version it's based on it should run about $300 to $500. Of course, let's celebrate the fact you can always upgrade it yourself! Not that if you're not already familiar with the vagaries of pro-level AMD Radeon cards, this probably isn't the computer for you.\n\nAccommodating extremes\n\nIt's expensive partly because it uses a Xeon processor and ECC memory, which isn't essential for a lot of professionals. But Apple's only less expensive alternatives using Intel's Core CPUs are crammed into the MacBook Pro stuck with the new mobile version (thus, slower) of AMD's middle tier graphics or the iMac, with not-upgradeable last-generation graphics.\n\nThere's also Apple's longstanding rift with Nvidia, which culminated in the deprecation of widely used CUDA and OpenCL APIs, essentially forcing all GPU-intensive software towards Metal and away from alternative low-level acceleration platforms. Among other things, that shuts out the ability to use less expensive but fast gaming-grade cards, where Nvidia routinely outperforms AMD. It also shuts out many content creators whose key software still only supports them. And despite their closer relationship, Apple doesn't offer AMD CPU options either, which means no 32-core Threadripper 3970X or PCIe 4.0 bus.\n\nPlus, there's the one-size-fits-all approach. The system's really big because it's designed to accommodate the needs of the $53,000 users. A lot of potential Mac Pro fans don't do video editing so don't need the space for the Afterburner card (or don't need to ingest or transcode ProRes, just encode, which Afterburner doesn't accelerate). Or, say, they just need the 28-core processor and a lot of memory but not space for dual GPUs or other PCI cards. Apple really needs at least one less expensive, more compact version of the Mac Pro.\n\nOn the flip side, you can't really configure it to the max, either. It only supports a single CPU (because W series), but high-resolution CGI rendering and video encoding will use up all the cores you can throw at it, as will crunching immense datasets for machine learning. And wouldn't you also like some free cycles for working while it's churning away, anyway? However, the CPU is socketed, so at least you can upgrade that if necessary.\n\nFinally, there's the warranty; that's really one size fits all. An individual buying a $50,000 professional workstation gets the same basic warranty as the person buying a $499 iPad: 1 year limited. The base warranty for other workstations, can be up to three years. One might consider $299 a reasonable price to pay for 3 year AppleCare Plus coverage for the Mac Pro, but it grates nonetheless.\n\nThe grass isn't necessarily greener\n\nThat's not to say everything's perfect on the other side of the fence. How the competitive price/performance ranking of the configurations compare to each other across software platforms awaits testing. You can sort of use iMac Pro performance as a proxy, and it's likely that the Mac Pro would deliver better performance with similar components than the iMac Pro because it doesn't face the same cooling constraints. But MacOS generally seems more efficient than Windows 10 because it's not burdened by Windows' more complex compatibility needs.\n\nFurthermore, the Mac Pro has two important advantages over most PC workstations for high-end content creation. First, it uses the new M versions of the 24- and 28-core W-series Intel Xeon workstation processors which support twice the amount of memory of the similar core-count PCs. At least, PCs don't use them at the moment.\n\nThe other advantage is integrated Thunderbolt 3. Until 20Gb/sec USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3-class 40Gb/sec USB4 become viable options -- the latter won't be ready until late 2020 at the earliest -- we're stuck with a top 10Gb/sec external transfer standard on desktops. This is an immense frustration for me.\n\nAll the fastest external media available today connects via TB3, like the OWC Envoy Pro EX, rated at up to 2800 MB/sec (that's 22.4Gb/sec). While there are PC motherboards that support TB3, it's hard to find systems that come with with it or even let you configure them with an add-in card (HP's workstations seem to be one of the few exceptions). Since the add-in cards tend to be motherboard-specific and every two TB3 connections take up a PCIe slot, it's not a no-brainer upgrade.\n\nAnd if you still think there's no way a reasonable person would spend that much on a single computer, feel free to take your $50K and pick up a mid-range Tesla instead.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/californias-kincade-wildfire-seen-space", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "title": "California's destructive Kincade wildfire seen from space", "text": "As Californians deal with several massive and fast-moving wildfires, the devastation can actually be seen from space.\n\nThe Kincade Fire, which began on Wednesday, has already burned over 66,000 acres, destroying or damaged at least 100 structures, and it's only 5 percent contained, according to the San Francisco Chronicle's Fire Tracker.\n\nWith firefighters five days into their battle against the flames, at least 185,000 residents have evacuated.\n\nHUGE ANCIENT BATHS UNEARTHED IN GREECE\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been chasing this fire for the last four days.

According to a CNBC tweet, T-Mobile and Sprint have to settle the deal by July 29. If the companies don\u2019t sell the assets to clear the merger condition, the Department of Justice will sue to block the potential merger.\n\nT-Mobile and Sprint have poured their blood, sweat, and tears into completing the deal. However, they haven\u2019t obtained regulatory approval. The stocks fell 1.2% and 2.4% and closed at $77.97 and $6.92, respectively, on Thursday. The shares have gained 22.6% and 18.9% year-to-date.\n\nSprint and T-Mobile face regulations\n\nThe $26.5 billion merger between T-Mobile and Sprint is facing regulatory obstacles. The FCC (Federal Communications Commission) was concerned that the merger would raise prices for wireless users. The parties agreed to keep the prices low for at least three years after the deal closes. The companies also agreed to deploy maximum 5G for the rural population, according to the FCC\u2019s conditions.\n\nThe FCC wanted the companies to divest their prepaid brand, Boost Mobile, to get regulatory approval. The FCC is concerned that Boost Mobile would give T-Mobile a dominant position in the prepaid wireless market. Notably, Boost Mobile is a vital brand for Sprint. The brand offers four lines with unlimited data, talk, and text for $100 per month. Most of Sprint\u2019s prepaid customers are on Boost Mobile. Other customers are on prepaid brands like Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless. Sprint had around 8.8 million prepaid customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended on March 31. T-Mobile has a more successful prepaid brand. The company has a higher prepaid customer base of around 21.1 million customers.\n\nThe Department of Justice is concerned that the Sprint-T-Mobile merger would reduce the number of carriers to three and disrupt the competitive environment. The antitrust division also wanted the companies to create a new mobile carrier by divesting their assets and spectrum. Apart from Sprint and T-Mobile, the top two US mobile carriers are Verizon and AT&T.\n\nT-Mobile agreed to divest its assets\n\nLate in May, US e-commerce retailer Amazon showed interest in the Boost Mobile\u2019s prepaid brand. According to reports, purchasing Boost Mobile would allow Amazon to use T-Mobile\u2019s wireless service for at least six years.\n\nComcast and Charter Communications were also interested in buying the spectrum divested by T-Mobile and Sprint. According to reports, the cable companies could combine their resources with the divested spectrum to become the fourth wireless network.\n\nT-Mobile agreed to divest some of its assets to Dish Network to satisfy the regulatory conditions. The assets would include the Boost Mobile prepaid brand and additional spectrum. The acquisition of T-Mobile\u2019s divested assets would make Dish Network the fourth wireless carrier in the US.\n\nDish Network as the fourth carrier\n\nAccording to the CNBC report, Dish Network could become a viable fourth wireless carrier. The cable company has been piling up wireless spectrum since 2011. The company wants to use its more than $20 billion worth of wireless airwaves. Reportedly, Dish Network is ready to pay $6 billion for Boost Mobile and additional spectrum licenses, which is higher than the earlier value of around $3 billion. The deal is also crucial for Dish Network. The company has been struggling with declining pay-TV customers for the past four years. The company\u2019s DISH TV subscriber losses were 259,000 in the first quarter\u2014worse than the subscriber losses of 94,000 in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nHowever, the assets divested to Dish Network might have sale restrictions in the future, according to Reuters. Also, T-Mobile and its stakeholder Deutsche Telekom aren\u2019t willing to divest the assets to a cable or technology company.\n\nT-Mobile and Sprint are optimistic about completing the deal. The two companies might also extend the July 29 deadline, according to reports. Notably, the companies told the court last month that they wouldn\u2019t close the deal until the state attorney generals complete the case. In June, several state attorney generals filed a lawsuit to block the deal. They argued that the merger would cost more than $4.5 billion annually for consumers. The trial would start in October.\n\nMerger might boost customers\n\nThe companies think that the merger would allow them to grow their customer base. Sprint and T-Mobile are struggling to grow their postpaid phone subscribers. Dominant telecom players and online streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon are taking away most of their customers. The telecom companies are struggling to retain their subscribers in the saturated wireless industry in the US.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended in March, Sprint lost net 189,000 postpaid phone customers, while Verizon lost 44,000 customers. AT&T and T-Mobile had postpaid phone net additions of 80,000 and 656,000 customers in the quarter ending in March. Meanwhile, Sprint is expected to attract more consumers after it gets merger approval for T-Mobile.\n\nCost synergies and expansion in 5G\n\nThe merger is also expected to bring cost synergies, which would help Sprint reduce its debt levels. Sprint\u2019s debt was $32.9 billion\u2014up ~3% year-over-year at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018, which ended on March 31.\n\nThe merger would help the companies expand their 5G wireless technology. The companies said that they won\u2019t be able to compete in 5G technology as a standalone company. The merger with T-Mobile would likely help Sprint expand its 5G services in more places. Meanwhile, T-Mobile doesn\u2019t plan to launch 5G services before the second half of 2019.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1367590/camilla-parker-bowles-prince-william-prince-charles-royal-family-spt", "authors": ["Abbie Llewelyn"], "title": "Camilla's reaction to meeting Prince William for the first time: 'I need a G&T!'", "text": "FREE now and never miss the top Royal stories again.

Deep Fusion will only work with iOS devices running an A13 Bionic processor, which is currently only the newest iPhones.\n\nWhen the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro were first announced in September, Apple showed off the new ultrawide-angle camera, Night Mode and an improved selfie camera, all of which represented a significant step forward for iPhone photography and videos. And now that they're in the wild, we've tested the new iPhone cameras and can confirm their improvements as well as the absolute enjoyment we feel using that ultrawide-angle camera. But there's one camera feature that Apple teased at its fall iPhone event that no one has gotten to try: Deep Fusion.\n\nWhile it sounds like the name of an acid jazz band, Apple claims the brand-new photo processing technique will make your pictures pop with detail while keeping the amount of image noise relatively low. The best way to think of Deep Fusion is that you're not meant to. Apple wants you to rely on this new technology but not think too much about it. There's no button to turn it on or off, or really any indication that you're even using the mode.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: We compare the cameras on the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone...\n\nRight now, anytime you take a photo on an iPhone 11, 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max, the default mode is Smart HDR, which takes a series of images before and after your shot and blends them together to improve the dynamic range and detail. If the environment is too dark, the camera switches automatically into Night Mode to improve brightness and reduce image noise. With Deep Fusion, anytime you take a photo in medium to low light conditions, like indoors, the camera will switch automatically into the mode to lower image noise and optimize detail. Deep Fusion, unlike Smart HDR, works at the pixel level. If you're using the \"telephoto\" lens on the iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max, the camera will drop into Deep Fusion pretty much anytime you're not in the brightest light.\n\nThis means the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max have optimized modes for bright light, low light and now medium light. And I'd argue that most people's photos are taken in medium- to low-light situations like indoors. The impact that Deep Fusion will have on your photos is enormous. It's like Apple changed the recipe of Coke.\n\nAt the iPhone event, Apple's Phil Schiller described Deep Fusion as \"computational photography mad science.\" And when you hear how it works, you'll likely agree.\n\nEssentially anytime you go to take a photo, the camera is capturing multiple images. Again, Smart HDR does something similar. The iPhone takes a reference photo that's meant to stop motion blur as much as possible. Next, it combines three standard exposures and one long exposure into a single \"synthetic long\" photo. Deep Fusion then breaks down the reference image and synthetic long photo into multiple regions identifying skies, walls, textures and fine details (like hair). Next, the software does a pixel-by-pixel analysis of the two photos -- that's 24 million pixels in total. The results of that analysis are used to determine which pixels to use and optimize in building a final image.\n\nApple\n\nApple says that the entire process takes a second or so to happen. But to allow to you to continue snapping shots, all of the information is captured and processed when your iPhone's A13 processor has a chance. The idea is that you won't be waiting on Deep Fusion before taking the next photo.\n\nThe release of Deep Fusion comes just a couple weeks before Google will formally announce the Pixel 4, its latest flagship phone in a line renowned for camera prowess.\n\nI should note that Deep Fusion will only be available on the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max because it needs the A13 Bionic processor to work. I'm excited to try it out and share the results once the developer's version is out.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: iPhone 11: 3 phones, reviewed.

While returns won\u2019t be certified until early next month, the AP analysis concluded that there are unlikely to be enough ballots remaining to change the outcome.\n\n\u201cCalifornia voters understood the very real threat Proposition 15 presented to small businesses, farmers and consumers,\u201d Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce, said in a written statement. \u201cVoters in California smartly recognized that enacting the largest tax hike in California history would have been devastating to jobs, our economy and California\u2019s future competitiveness.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, Proposition 15 was a fight about a different ballot measure \u2014 Proposition 13, the 1978 landmark initiative that created a tight cap on property values and tax rates. The new proposal\u2019s supporters spent years crafting their plan to strip high-value business properties from the protections provided by Proposition 13, arguing that it had allowed powerful corporations to avoid paying property taxes they could easily afford. The November ballot measure could have generated as much as $11.5 billion a year for public schools and local government services once fully implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere Proposition 13 sets the value of a property by its purchase price and caps the annual tax at 1% of the value, Proposition 15 would have generated new tax revenue by allowing more frequent valuations of commercial and industrial property holdings worth $3 million or more. Some lower-valued properties would have also been swept into the system because their owners have large portfolios of property across California.\n\nProposition 15 was explicit in its protection of residential property tax rules, though some of its opponents ominously warned that it was the first step toward a complete overhaul, or outright repeal, of Proposition 13.\n\n\u201cAgainst all odds, Prop. 15 made history by taking on the status quo to ensure California becomes a more prosperous and equitable state for everyone,\u201d Alex Stack, a Yes on 15 spokesperson, said in a written statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupporters prevailed in Los Angeles, the Bay Area and a handful of California\u2019s other coastal counties, according to unofficial returns. But Proposition 15 ran into strong opposition just about everywhere else, resoundingly rejected in the Central Valley, Inland Empire and Orange and San Diego counties.\n\nThe final tally of support was almost the same as that found in a poll last month by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, in which 49% of likely voters said they would vote for Proposition 15. The business-funded campaign opposed to Proposition 15 said its own private polling found that voters who were undecided toward the end broke sharply against the measure.\n\nVoters were not swayed by the promise of new, substantial tax revenue. Approximately 40% of the revenue would have been sent to K-12 schools and community colleges, while the remaining 60% would go to counties, cities and special districts for services such as law enforcement and fire suppression. The Berkeley poll found that less than a majority of middle-aged voters and those who described themselves as moderates or conservatives believed the new tax revenue was needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the homeowner tax protections of Proposition 13 have remained strongly popular over the last four decades, liberal interest groups and labor unions believed few voters realized that the low-tax rules also applied to multimillion-dollar corporations. Numerous studies revealed that many of these companies, many headquartered in Southern California and the Bay Area, operate in facilities where land values have changed very little since the 1970s \u2014 even as new businesses and homeowners alike pay taxes on property assessed more closely to market value.\n\nBusiness groups that funded the opposition effort \u2014 contributing to a campaign with combined donations of more than $125 million \u2014 sought to divert attention away from large corporations and focus on Proposition 15\u2019s potential impact on small businesses. Their advertising campaign hammered away at the fact that business owners who lease their location are often required to pay some, or all, of the building owner\u2019s property taxes.\n\nIt is unlikely that the defeat of Proposition 15 will be the end of the discussion for Proposition 13 critics. The proposal had the support of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has also suggested broader reviews of California\u2019s tax structure in an effort to limit some of the lingering effects of Proposition 13 \u2014 most notably, how the cut in property taxes made government services more dependent on income and sales taxes, both susceptible to rapid up-and-down changes.\n\nAny new effort would likely again be contested by business groups, who argue that California is already one of the most expensive states in the country for entrepreneurs and corporate operations.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.healthline.com/health-news/if-youre-pregnant-heres-what-to-know-about-the-coronavirus", "authors": [], "title": "If You\u2019re Pregnant, Here\u2019s What to Know About the Coronavirus", "text": "Share on Pinterest Research is limited but experts don\u2019t see evidence that the disease can be passed in utero.\n\nNewborns may face risks if they contract the disease after being born.\n\nExperts are still learning the best way for women who contract COVID-19 to give birth to minimize the risk of transmission. One of the biggest concerns about COVID-19, the illness caused by the new 2019 coronavirus, is how the infection affects pregnant women and their unborn children. Though evidence is extremely limited, early research suggests the virus cannot be transmitted in the womb. Still, after reports circulated this weekend that a newborn baby in Britain tested positive for COVID-19 moments after being born, it\u2019s clear we need more data about the disease before any conclusions can be made. Here, we take a look at what we do know and address some of the biggest questions people have about COVID-19 and pregnancy.\n\nCan it be passed to my fetus in the womb? One of the biggest findings in preliminary research is that the virus doesn\u2019t appear to pass from mother to fetus in the womb. Dr. Wei Zhang, an associate professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine, recently co-authored a study that looked at 9 pregnant women in China diagnosed with COVID-19 who gave birth via C-section. His research team tested amniotic fluid, cord blood, baby\u2019s throat swab, and breast milk, and didn\u2019t find any evidence that the virus could pass from mom to baby in the womb or through a C-section, Zhang said. The newborn who recently tested positive in England doesn\u2019t disprove these findings \u2014 there\u2019s no information about what kind of preventive measures were taken during delivery or what specimens were tested by the family\u2019s medical teams. It\u2019s unclear how the baby contracted the virus. Though the virus doesn\u2019t seem to be vertically transmitted, an analysis on 10 newborn babies from mothers with COVID-19 found that the infection does seem to have an adverse effect on newborns \u2014 including respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia (a low blood platelet count), and abnormal liver function. Because of this, health experts agree we need more data to fully assess newborns\u2019 risk of contracting the virus.\n\nWhich is safer: C-section or vaginal birth? It\u2019s too soon to say. All of the women included in Zhang\u2019s research gave birth via C-section, and the risk linked to vaginal births was not assessed. Certain viral infections can be passed from mom to baby during delivery, according to Dr. Jessica Madden, a board certified pediatrician, neonatologist, and medical director of Aeroflow Breastpumps. The flu virus, for example, doesn\u2019t pass to babies during vaginal delivery. Other viruses , like HIV and herpes, can spread through blood and bodily fluids, which makes C-sections a safer choice. There\u2019s no proof either birth method is safer at this time with COVID-19. \u201cCurrently, one mode of delivery [is] not recommended over another,\u201d Madden said. \u201cI\u2019m under the impression it\u2019s the decision of the OB-GYN and it\u2019s going to be case by case.\u201d One concern about C-sections is that they require patients to spend more time in the hospital recovering. \u201cIf you increase your hospital stay, you\u2019re probably going to increase your risk of getting coronavirus in the hospital since everyone\u2019s who is admitted will be acutely ill,\u201d said Dr. Brian Levine, a board certified reproductive endocrinologist, OB-GYN, and practice director of CCRM Fertility New York.\n\nDoes COVID-19 up my risk of complications? Again, data is limited , but one trend observed across pregnant women with COVID-19 is preterm delivery. In a recent webinar geared toward health professionals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shared their findings from evaluating the health data of 34 women from China diagnosed with COVID-19 in the third trimester. They reported that pregnant women with COVID-19 have a greater risk of delivering prematurely, and on average, give birth around 36 weeks \u2014 4 weeks before the due date. In more severe cases, COVID-19 may cause pneumonia, which is a concern for pregnant women because already \u201ctheir lung capacity is already slightly diminished,\u201d said Madden. If a pregnant woman experiences severely poor oxygenation, the child may be deprived of oxygen which can put them at a higher risk for lasting developmental issues, according to Levine. Another concern is that COVID-19 often causes a fever. In the first trimester, elevated body temperature is associated with fetal developmental anomaly. In the third trimester, a high body temperature can lead to dehydration which can trigger a premature delivery, Levine added.\n\nIs my immune system up for the task? A pregnant person\u2019s immune system changes after conception so the body won\u2019t reject the fetus. Because of this shift, pregnant women\u2019s immunity is slightly diminished \u2014 that, in general, puts pregnant women at a higher risk for viral infections, according to Madden. The flu and other respiratory infections are known to cause more severe illnesses in pregnant women, so the novel coronavirus may do the same \u2014 but again, we don\u2019t have enough data to know for sure. That said, the CDC reported that pregnant women aren\u2019t appearing to become any sicker from COVID-19 than non-pregnant women of the same age.\n\nWhat happens after I give birth? Anyone diagnosed with COVID-19, including the mother, will need to be isolated from the newborn until they recover in order to avoid transmitting the virus to the baby, according to Zhang. The CDC is still advising new moms with COVID-19 to continue to provide breast milk. Although breast milk doesn\u2019t seem to carry the virus, close contact should be avoided. \u201cSince direct contact is a confirmed route of transmission, some care needs to be taken to limit the chance of infecting a newborn if they do breastfeed,\u201d Zhang said. New mothers may need to consider using protective equipment \u2014 like masks, gowns, or gloves \u2014 or feeding the newborn breast milk via bottle.\n\nWhat steps should I be taking now? Pregnant women should maintain a good line of communication with their OB-GYN, and ask if any appointments can be spaced out or conducted remotely to lower the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus. If a pregnant woman has a known exposure to someone who\u2019s sick or is experiencing any symptoms, it\u2019s crucial to call their OB-GYN as soon as possible, Madden said. Hand washing, social distancing, and steering clear of anyone who\u2019s sick can lower the risk of being exposed to the virus. Madden also recommends that pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 avoid at-home births. A hospital can ensure both the mother and the baby are monitored to ensure the baby isn\u2019t developing symptoms or getting sick. \u201cI don\u2019t think that can be done in a home setting properly,\u201d Madden said. \u201cIn this case, for the well-being of both her and her baby, it\u2019s really essential [to give birth at a hospital].\u201d Other than that, follow the advice from the CDC . As we learn more, the recommendations will change. At this point, the data we do have is rather reassuring, said Madden. The virus doesn\u2019t seem to spread through the womb. All newborns, with the exception of the baby in England, have tested negative for COVID-19. And though pregnant women are considered an at-risk group, Madden said at this point it doesn\u2019t look like they have an increased risk of complications if they develop COVID-19.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-shift-100-million-cash-132404698.html", "authors": ["Lucas Shaw"], "title": "Netflix to Shift $100 Million in Cash Into Black-Owned Banks", "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Netflix Inc. will shift as much as $100 million to lenders that serve the Black community, making it the largest company yet to pledge cash to historically underfunded financial institutions.\n\nThe online TV giant will start by shifting $25 million into the Black Economic Development Initiative, a new fund that will invest in Black-owned financial institutions serving low-income communities, and $10 million to Hope Credit Union. Going forward, the company will steer 2% of its cash on hand, which currently amounts to about $5 billion, to financial organizations that directly support African-American communities.\n\nNews of Netflix\u2019s commitment sent shares of Black-owned banks soaring Tuesday. Carver Bancorp Inc. jumped as much as 173% in New York trading and Broadway Financial Corp. gained as much as 83%.\n\nLarge U.S. companies have rushed to show support for African Americans following the death of George Floyd, one of several Black people killed by police in the past few months. Many businesses and rich individuals have pledged money to civil rights causes, including Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings, who earmarked $120 million of his personal fortune to historically Black colleges and universities. But his company wanted to propose a solution that addresses more systemic causes of inequality.\n\nHope Credit Union serves more than 1.5 million people in states including Alabama and Louisiana, but it doesn\u2019t have enough money to fully support the financial needs in its communities, according to its CEO, Bill Bynum.\n\n\u201cWe are capital-starved, just like the people in the communities we serve,\u201d Bynum said. \u201cHaving a global voice like Netflix say it\u2019s important to invest in financial institutions like Hope is tremendously important, not just for the capital we will use to make mortgage loans and small business loans, but for what it says.\u201d\n\nOne Employee\n\nNetflix executive Aaron Mitchell came up with the idea of shifting money into Black-owned banks following an April dinner with leaders from different underrepresented groups. Netflix has been hosting these dinners since October in an effort to improve diversity at its highest levels and inform its top executives.\n\nMitchell pitched the idea to Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann and began conducting research, reaching out to banks and reading \u201cThe Color of Money,\u201d Mehrsa Baradaran\u2019s book about the racial wealth gap. After Floyd\u2019s death, he sent his proposal to Hastings, who expedited the project.\n\n\u201cI have talked to a lot of companies, but this is the first company that\u2019s actually done something about it,\u201d Baradaran said.\n\nNetflix hopes the move will inspire other large U.S. companies to do the same, Neumann said. The streaming service has a small cash pile relative to Silicon Valley peers Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. If every company in the S&P 500 shifted just 1% of its cash to Black-owned financial institutions, it would translate into more than $20 billion, Netflix said.\n\nNetflix Record\n\nNetflix has a lot of work to do on its own. The company has no Black executives among its eight top officers, and added its first Black board member in 2018. It ranked toward the bottom of the pack last year among Hollywood studios in terms of hiring women directors, according to the Directors\u2019 Guild of America.\n\nBut the guild ranked the company first in adding people of color, part of the progress it has made since hiring Verna Myers as its head of diversity and inclusion in 2018. She aided programs such as Strong Black Lead, which highlights projects with African Americans in lead roles. Black employees now make up 7% of Netflix\u2019s overall employee base, up from 4% three years ago. The number of Black vice presidents has tripled to nine over the same span.\n\n\u201cWe have been on this journey now for at least the last three years,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe still have lots of work to do, but we are making meaningful progress.\u201d\n\n(Updates with shares in third paragraph.

In November, Bloomberg reported the agency was scrutinizing whether WeWork broke any financial rules.\n\nWeWork declined to comment on Cotton's remarks.

Min Min is the first contender in Fighters Pass Vol. 2, and we now potentially know who will follow her as the next DLC character ahead of their official reveal.\n\nIn a new video from GameStop, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's next character was seemingly leaked. If this turns out to be legitimate and you're looking to avoid spoilers, we advise you turn back now.\n\nGameStop recently released an \"All In\" video focusing on the Paper Mario series in honor of the upcoming release of Paper Mario: The Origami King. Host Pamela Horton walks viewers through the history of the franchise, looking back at the series' roots.\n\nNaturally, such a look back takes us right to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. While providing some details on the RPG title, Horton mentions how much fans love the game and talks about the title's unique humor and character designs.\n\nWhat follows is a very peculiar statement about Geno, the fan-favorite Star Road Warrior. \"I mean, there's a reason people were freaking out when Geno was announced for Smash!\" Horton says.\n\nObviously, this is an odd exclamation considering Geno has not been revealed as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It also doesn't quite line up with anything related to the character and the crossover fighting game.\n\n\n\nClick image to view clip, *enable audio on the GIF\n\nOn-screen during this statement we see Geno's character art on the Spirit Board. If Horton is referring to Geno's spirit, that wouldn't fit the bill as fans weren't \"freaking out\" when he was revealed to be a non-playable piece in one of the Smash Bros. series' newest modes \u2014 the reaction was quite the opposite, actually.\n\nThe very same can be said for the Geno Mii Fighter costume that was released back in Super Smash Bros. 4. Fans were not thrilled about this choice as it meant that the Mario RPG representative wouldn't be a playable character, and that also took place back in 2015.\n\nThe implication here, considering the source, is that GameStop was given early information on Smash Bros. Ultimate's next DLC character and may have included that detail under the impression that an official announcement was planned to already have been made by this point.\n\nNintendo has been very vocal about their current set of circumstances regarding the adjustments made due to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. With employees working from home, including Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai, there's a chance that an announcement of the next character was initially planned to be made by now, but may have been set back due to the current situation.\n\nDuring the presentation showcasing Min Min, Sakurai reiterated that development has been more of a challenge due to the pandemic. He noted that even despite what's going on right now, the Smash Bros. development team promises to deliver the next five DLC characters with their own special trailers.\n\n\"Even in the video game industry, some games may be facing challenges,\" Sakurai said on the subject of the pandemic. \"The launch plans of some games may be changed.\" With that having been said, it is possible that the Geno reveal was meant to have happened already, but was ultimately delayed.\n\nA reveal of Geno for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate definitely would have coincided well with the press and launch of the new Paper Mario game. However, now that that window has been missed, fans will likely be looking to the rumored Nintendo Direct that is believed to be taking place later this month.\n\nGeno is a character that fans have been requesting for a very long time now. Even Sakurai himself wants Geno in Super Smash Bros., and in the past he's tried to make it happen but to no avail.\n\nOn YouTube, GameStop followed up in the comments saying that they do not have any insider information on the matter. \"To clear up any confusion, Geno is a spirit in Smash, not a playable character (as shown in the footage at 2:07). We don't have any information regarding new Smash characters that the public doesn't have,\" the company wrote.\n\nWe don't know for sure if this potential slip of the tongue is confirmation that Geno is next in line for Smash, but he is a character that is high up on the list of fan demand.

It will be a flamboyant homecoming for the sample return capsule from Hayabusa2, a Japanese spacecraft launched almost exactly six years ago on a mission to shoot an ancient asteroid and steal some of its dirt. If the capsule survives its fiery descent, its payload of pristine space rock will help scientists understand the earliest days of our solar system, shed light on the mysterious origins of meteorites, and may even provide clues about the emergence of life on Earth.\n\nBy the time it lands under parachute in the Australian outback, the sample will have traveled more than 180 million miles from Ryugu, a diamond-shaped asteroid orbiting the sun between Earth and Mars. Scientists believe that Ryugu broke off from a larger parent body only a few million years ago, but the rocks that compose it are closer to 4 billion years old. Hayabusa2 camped out around Ryugu for more than a year and a half, studying the asteroid from a distance and sending robotic scouts to its surface to prepare for a sample collection. It\u2019s main mission was to collect just a few grams of dust and pebbles from this cosmic time capsule that has been preserved for eons in the frigid vacuum of space.\n\n\u201cWe're hoping to learn a lot about how a giant cloud of gas and dust turned into planets 4.5 billion years ago in our solar system,\u201d says Larry Nittler, a cosmochemist at the Carnegie Institution for Science and one of nine American scientists selected by NASA to participate in the Japanese mission. \u201cRyugu and other asteroids like it are basically the leftover building blocks that didn't grow into planets and have been floating around ever since.\u201d\n\nRyugu looks like a piece of charcoal the size of several city blocks, and it spins like a top once every eight hours. It is one of the darkest asteroids ever discovered, its inky complexion a result of all the carbon trapped in organic compounds smeared across its surface. Some of these prebiotic compounds, such as amino acids, are the building blocks of life, and it may very well have been asteroids like Ryugu that seeded Earth with the molecular grist that kicked evolution into gear.\n\nCarbonaceous asteroids like Ryugu are abundant in our solar system, but they mostly hang out around the outer planets. Every now and then, they bump into each other, break apart, and the pieces are sent on a trajectory toward the sun\u2019s inner sanctum. If those pieces happen to collide with Earth, we call them meteorites. Almost everything we know about them is from the bits and pieces that make it to the surface. But by the time these stones have crash-landed on Earth, they have been cooked to a crisp and have been corrupted by terrestrial chemistry. Sending a probe to a still-orbiting asteroid is the best way to collect a clean sample. As the first spacecraft to visit a carbonaceous asteroid, Hayabusa2 can help determine the provenance of meteorites discovered on Earth and shed some light on the processes that formed the organic compounds in the early solar system.\n\n\u201cAre there samples of the organics that we don\u2019t have in our collection because they didn\u2019t survive going through the atmosphere? We don\u2019t know,\u201d says Harold Connolly, a geologist at Rowan University and a member of the sample analysis team for Hayabusa2 and NASA\u2019s own asteroid sample return mission, OSIRIS-REx.

But that doesn't mean hoaxes don't exist. In fact, when it comes to the coronavirus crisis, disinformation, propaganda and hoaxes abound. Ironically, one of the sources is, you guessed it, Russia.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAccording to the Washington Post:\n\nA top State Department official said Thursday that Russia is behind \"swarms of online, false personas\" that sought to spread misinformation about coronavirus on social-media sites, stressing the \"entire ecosystem of Russian disinformation is at play.\" ... The tweets themselves floated a number of harmful conspiracy theories \u2014 suggesting, for example, that the coronavirus had been created by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or was the result of a bioweapon. Some of the tweets linked to YouTube videos, according to the State Department document, suggesting the problem went beyond Twitter\n\nThat's unnerving, to say the least. But the story is confusing, with social media platforms insisting they are uninformed about these activities and the government refusing to share its methodology.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the right wing has eagerly jumped on some of the disinformation, such as the lie that the virus is a Chinese bioweapon. In fact, one of the president's most fervent supporters, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, went on national TV to spread it, doubling down when called on it by experts. It's unclear where Cotton got his \"hypothesis\" but it had already been debunked by numerous sources at the time he was telling millions of people it was possible.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs Richard Ebright, a professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University, told the Washington Post, \"There's absolutely nothing in the genome sequence of this virus that indicates the virus was engineered. The possibility this was a deliberately released bioweapon can be firmly excluded.\"\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates conspiracy theory took hold deep in the right-wing fever swamp early on. BuzzFeed reported on it back in January:\n\nA false rumor that the coronavirus outbreak is a plot by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates is being spread by supporters of the pro-Trump QAnon movement and the anti-vax community. A QAnon YouTuber named Jordan Sather warned his followers on Tuesday that the coronavirus was a \"new fad disease\" and claimed the release of the virus that causes it was \"planned.\" Following Sather's heavily retweeted thread, the conspiracy theory traveled across Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.\n\nIf these rumors and lies were started by the Russian government it just proves, once again, that they know their targets. But the truth is that Americans don't really need their help. The right-wing media is doing a great job of misleading half the country all by themselves.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nRecall that a week or so ago, Rush Limbaugh insisted that the coronavirus was just a common cold and it was being \"weaponized\" to use against the president. Rush wasn't the only one spreading this nonsense. According to AFPFactcheck, it turned up on Twitter and Facebook, with people sharing images from old medical textbooks saying that coronavirus is the common cold. (Yes, the common cold is a coronavirus, but the \"novel coronavirus\" COVID-19 most certainly is not the common cold.)\n\nHalf a dozen different Fox News programs have blamed the homeless population for spreading the disease, despite absolutely no evidence that has happened. This fits with their evident programming directive to demean and degrade the homeless population as often as possible, particularly in states that didn't vote for Donald Trump.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn fact, most of the disinformation coming from the right-wing media is in service of protecting the president's fake reputation as the greatest leader the world has ever known. Since he is a font of confusion, ignorance and misinformation on the subject, they end up making their audience and all the people their audience comes in contact with vulnerable to the illness.\n\nFor instance, Trump appeared on Sean Hannity's show on Wednesday night and made this daft comment:\n\nWe have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better, just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work, some of them go to work, but they get better.\n\nApparently, Trump thinks that a lot of people going to work while infectious is no big deal, except to the extent that they don't get counted and all the deaths that occur from exposure to people who don't know they carry the virus look worse than they really are. Or something.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThat tweet makes you wonder if they're \"working very hard to keep these numbers low\" on purpose. Unfortunately, the only way to do that is by not testing people \u2014 which is what's happening.\n\nThe upshot is that the president continually suggests that the threat of the virus is being overblown and that he's doing a \"fabulous job\" in dealing with it anyway. Needless to say, if anyone says otherwise, it's a hoax.\n\nHis minions on Fox News are happy to help spread the good word.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHannity, sounding more like a North Korean broadcaster extolling the virtues of the Dear Leader than like a member of the free press, claimed that President Obama had ignored the swine flu outbreak until thousands of people had died:\n\nVirtually everything he said is false.\n\nChanneling the president's view that a miracle might end the pandemic, Fox News host Jesse Watters went with a little Kumbaya:\n\nYou want to know how I really feel about the coronavirus, Juan? If I get it, I'll beat it. I'm not lying. It's called the power of positive thinking and I think America needs to wake up to that. I live in Manhattan, I got off work the other night, went straight to the subway. Asian guy sits down to me \u2014 mask on. What do I do? Finish the ride, then I go home and I order Chinese food. I'm not afraid of the coronavirus and no one else should be that afraid either.\n\nThat's easy for him to say. Pity the vulnerable people he and anyone who listens to him might infect with that cavalier attitude. But I suppose it's better than this nihilistic greed-head:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTrump held a town-hall meeting on Fox News on Thursday night and once again praised himself to high heaven for his masterful handling of the crisis. Being the sunny optimist that he is, he found the upside in the whole thing:\n\nI suspect that if you see a person wearing a MAGA hat these days, it might be wise to steer clear. If they are watching Fox News or listening to Rush, it's doubtful they are taking the precautions that would protect themselves, and you, from this virus. Why would they? As far as they know, their very stable genius leader has everything in hand. If anyone says otherwise, it's just another hoax.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.sltrib.com/news/2020/10/31/utah-reports-new-cases/", "authors": ["Bjacobs Sltrib.Com", "Becky Jacobs"], "title": "Utah reports 1,724 new cases, 3 more deaths Saturday", "text": "Editor\u2019s note: The Salt Lake Tribune is providing free access to critical stories about the coronavirus.

It hampers daily life and can also make them reliant on medication to deal with the pain. For others, it is just a plain nuisance. Many women are now choosing to give up on this biological process altogether.\n\nBy taking oral contraceptives, one can either stop or considerably lighten the bleeding. These contraceptives are usually taken to prevent pregnancy. A recent drop in tampon sales are indicative of the fact that women are using these tablets to stop the bleeding. About a fifth of women using the contraceptive implant no longer bleed, while many who take contraceptive pills without a break often achieve the same result. \u2013 and they are not the only methods.\n\nThere are other methods to stop the bleeding too. \u201cI started taking the mini-pill purely for the fact it would stop my periods,\u201d says Jaimi Kendall, 25, from Exeter. \u201cFor years, I had extremely heavy periods that would drag on for eight weeks or so and left me severely anaemic to the point where I started experiencing pulsatile tinnitus. Not having periods any more is a blessing.\u201d\n\nCatriona Clarke, 25, from Cambridge, also realised that bleeding could be stopped with tablets and was thrilled. \u201cMy periods weren\u2019t even that bad,\u201d she said, \u201cjust uncomfortable and a mess. And, given how expensive period products can be, an expensive mess.\u201d\n\nDuring menstruation, the body sheds the lining of the uterus along with the unfertilised egg. It is triggered by fluctuating levels of the oestrogen and progesterone hormone. By not having periods, the body doesn\u2019t create a \u201cbacklog\u201d, and nor is the process of bleeding a \u2018cleansing of the body\u2019 Menstruation can, however, affect physical and mental health. It can lead to endometriosis and depression and also be a problem for those with gender dysphoria. A survey conducted by Public Health England of 7,500 women, aged between 16-64 reported that they faced menstrual issues in the last year.\n\n\u201cHistorically, women would spend much of their time pregnant or breastfeeding (which can delay the return of periods). It would be a minority of people who had a couple of children only and menstruated all the way through their lives,\u201d explained Dr Jane Thomas, a consultant gynaecologist at Homerton university hospital. It is a modern phenomenon, having so many periods, reported The Guardian.\n\nIf women don\u2019t want to have their periods, there is no medical reason for it to continue happening. Regular periods are supposed to be an indication of good health. Dr Anne Connolly, gynaecologist, said \u201cNinety-nine per cent of women don\u2019t need to bleed.\u201d\n\nNot bleeding has a myriad of benefits. You can save money, mitigate health problems including Polycystic ovarian syndrome. PCOS is caused by cell build up in the uterus and it can be prevented by taking oral contraceptives as it keeps the lining of the womb thin.\n\nMany have raised concerns that bleeding is a sign that the woman has not conceived. Experts also stress that stopping periods won\u2019t affect future fertility. \u201cWhen you stop taking the hormones, they get flushed out of your system very quickly, and your periods will return to what they were before you started taking the pill,\u201d said Connolly.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/7-old-boy-526-teeth-093016922.html", "authors": ["Amy Gunia"], "title": "7-Year-Old Boy Has 526 Teeth Removed From His Mouth", "text": "Doctors removed 526 teeth from a 7-year-old boy\u2019s mouth during surgery in Chennai, India, CBS News reported Thursday.\n\nThe boy was brought to the hospital with swelling in his jaw, according to a statement from the Saveetha Dental College and Hospital.

Add ISIS as an interest to stay up to date on the latest ISIS news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nNearly two decades after the U.S.-led invasion, the extremist group is seen as an even greater threat than the Taliban because of its increasingly sophisticated military capabilities and its strategy of targeting civilians, both in Afghanistan and abroad. Concerns run so deep that many have come to see the Taliban, which have also clashed with IS, as a potential partner in containing it.\n\nA U.S. intelligence official based in Afghanistan told The Associated Press that a recent wave of attacks in the capital, Kabul, is \"practice runs\" for even bigger attacks in Europe and the United States.\n\n\"This group is the most near-term threat to our homelands from Afghanistan,\" the official said on condition of anonymity to preserve his operational security. \"The IS core mandate is: You will conduct external attacks\" in the U.S. and Europe. \"That is their goal. It's just a matter of time,\" he said. \"It is very scary.\"\n\nBruce Hoffman, director of the Center for Security Studies at Georgetown University, sees Afghanistan as a possible new base for IS now that it has been driven from Iraq and Syria. \"ISIS has invested a disproportionate amount of attention and resources in Afghanistan,\" he said, pointing to \"huge arms stockpiling\" in the east.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nA 'PROVINCE' OF THE CALIPHATE\n\nThe Islamic State affiliate appeared in Afghanistan shortly after the group's core fighters swept across Syria and Iraq in the summer of 2014, carving out a self-styled caliphate, or Islamic empire, in around a third of both countries. The Afghanistan affiliate refers to itself as the Khorasan Province, a name applied to parts of Afghanistan, Iran and central Asia in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe IS affiliate initially numbered just a few dozen fighters, mainly Pakistani Taliban driven from their bases across the border and disgruntled Afghan Taliban attracted to IS' more extreme ideology. While the Taliban have confined their struggle to Afghanistan, the IS militants pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the reclusive leader of the group in the Middle East, and embraced his call for a worldwide jihad against non-Muslims. Within Afghanistan, IS launched large-scale attacks on minority Shiites, who it views as apostates deserving of death\n\nThe group suffered some early stumbles as its leaders were picked off by U.S. airstrikes. But it received a major boost when the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan joined its ranks in 2015. Today it counts thousands of fighters, many from central Asia but also from Arab countries, Chechnya, India and Bangladesh, as well as ethnic Uighurs from China.\n\nThe group has long been based in the eastern Nangarhar province, a rugged region along the border with Pakistan, but has a strong presence in northern Afghanistan and of late has expanded into neighboring Kunar province, where it could prove even harder to dislodge. The mountainous province provided shelter for Osama bin Laden for nearly a year after the Taliban's ouster, and U.S. forces struggled for years to capture and hold high-altitude outposts there, eventually all but surrendering the region to the Taliban.\n\nThe area comprising the provinces of Nangarhar, Nuristan, Kunar and Laghman was so dangerous that the U.S.-led coalition assigned an acronym to it in the years after the invasion, referring to it as N2KL. Militants launching shoulder-fired rockets from Kunar's peaks downed a U.S. Chinook helicopter in 2005, killing 16 Navy SEALs and special operations forces in one of the deadliest single attacks of the war.\n\nAjmal Omar, a member of the Nangarhar provincial council, says IS now has a presence in all four provinces.\n\n\"Right now in Kunar, the right side of the road is Taliban, the left side is Daesh and the government is in the middle,\" he said, referring to the group by its Arabic acronym. Speaking inside his heavily fortified home in the provincial capital, Jalalabad, he said neighboring Kunar would soon replace the Middle East as the IS group's center of gravity.\n\n\"When they began in Afghanistan they were maybe 150 Daesh, but today there are thousands and thousands,\" he said.\n\n\"The bad news is their acquisition of key terrain, height concealment, where they can have easy access to money, weapons, equipment . . .and from where they can plan, train, stage, facilitate and expedite attacks,\" said the U.S. intelligence official. \"I think expansion of territory in eastern Afghanistan is their number one military objective,\" with the goal of eventually encircling Jalalabad, he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTURNING TO THE TALIBAN\n\nIt's been nearly 18 years since the U.S. invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban, which had harbored al-Qaida when bin Laden and his lieutenants were planning the Sept. 11 attacks. Now military and intelligence officials see the Taliban as a potential ally against a similar threat.\n\nIn recent months the Taliban have said they have no ambitions to monopolize power in a post-war Afghanistan, while IS is committed to overthrowing the Kabul government on its path to establishing a global caliphate. The Taliban and IS are sharply divided over ideology and tactics, with the Taliban largely confining their attacks to government targets and Afghan and international security forces. The Taliban and IS have fought each other on a number of occasions, and the Taliban are still the larger and more imposing force.\n\nU.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has held several rounds of talks with the Taliban in recent months in a bid to end America's longest war. The two sides appear to be closing in on an agreement in which the U.S. would withdraw its forces in return for a pledge from the Taliban to keep the country from being used as a launch pad for global attacks.\n\n\"One of the hopes of a negotiated settlement is that it will bring the Taliban into the government and into the fight against IS,\" the U.S. intelligence official said. \"They know the mountains, they know the terrain. It's their territory.\"\n\nBut a negotiated settlement could also prompt an exodus of more radical Taliban fighters to join IS. That process is already underway in parts of northern and eastern Afghanistan, where the Taliban have attacked IS only to lose territory and fighters to the rival extremist group.\n\nRussia, which occupied Afghanistan in the 1980s before being driven out by U.S.-backed Islamic insurgents, has been sounding the alarm about IS for years, and had reached out to the Taliban even before the U.S. talks. During a visit to Kyrgyzstan last month, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu described Afghanistan as a \"launch pad\" for IS after the group was pushed out of Syria and Iraq.\n\nRussia, like the United States, sees a peace agreement between the Taliban and the Afghan government as the best way of countering the threat posed by IS, and Moscow has held two rounds of informal talks involving the Taliban, government representatives and other prominent Afghans.\n\nBut as peace efforts have stumbled in recent months, Russia has turned to more lethal means of containing the threat. Shoigu said Russia has sent heavy equipment, including helicopters and armored vehicles, to Kyrgyz forces, and has boosted combat readiness in its bases in the former Soviet republics of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nTHREATENING THE WEST\n\nWithout an aggressive counterterrorism strategy, Afghanistan's IS affiliate will be able to carry out a large-scale attack in the U.S. or Europe within the next year, the U.S. intelligence official said, adding that IS fighters captured in Afghanistan have been found to be in contact with fellow militants in other countries.\n\nAuthorities have also already made at least eight arrests in the United States linked to the IS affiliate in Afghanistan.\n\nMartin Azizi-Yarand, the 18-year-old Texan who plotted a 2018 attack on a suburban mall, said he was inspired by IS and was preparing to join the affiliate in Afghanistan. He was sentenced in April to 20 years in jail.\n\nRakhmat Akilov, the 39-year-old Uzbek who plowed his truck into pedestrians in Stockholm in 2017, also had links with the Afghanistan affiliate, the intelligence official said. \"During interrogation he said 'this is my commander in Afghanistan and he is telling me what to do,'\" he said.\n\nInside Afghanistan, the group is actively recruiting at universities, where it is more likely to find tech-savvy Afghans able to travel abroad, use social media and help plan sophisticated attacks, according to the intelligence official.\n\nThe group's brutal tactics have been on vivid display inside Afghanistan for years. Suicide bombings have killed hundreds of Shiite civilians in Kabul and elsewhere, and residents who have fled areas captured by the group describe a reign of terror not unlike that seen in Syria and Iraq.\n\nFarmanullah Shirzad fled his village in Nangarhar in late April as IS fighters swept through the area.\n\n\"I was terrified to stay,\" he said. \"When Daesh takes over a village, they kill the people, they don't care about the children and they come into the homes and they take the women.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Amir Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan, and Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/23/jerry-jeudy-denver-broncos-nfl-draft/", "authors": ["Ryan O Halloran", "Broncos Reporter", "Ryan O Halloran Is In His Second Season Covering The Broncos For The Post", "His Year Overall Covering The Nfl.

Things fell perfectly for the Broncos when the New York Jets selected offensive tackle Mekhi Becton 11th and San Francisco, following a one-spot trade down with Tampa Bay, opted for South Carolina defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw.\n\n\u201cI expected to go a little higher, but at the same time, the draft every year is crazy and you never know what will happen,\u201d Jeudy said during a media conference call.\n\nOn Twitter following the pick, Elway said Jeudy was the Broncos\u2019 top-rated receiver. They chose Jeudy over the still-available CeeDee Lamb of Oklahoma and Justin Jefferson of LSU. Lamb went No. 17 to Dallas.\n\n\u201cJerry\u2019s an excellent route runner who knows how to get open and he\u2019s from a winning program at Alabama,\u201d Elway wrote.\n\nElway had made 70 draft picks from 2011-19, but none were from Alabama. Recognizing the need to improve the Broncos\u2019 downfield passing game and give help to receiver Courtland Sutton (who was often double-teamed, particularly in the red zone) and tight end Noah Fant (who should capitalize in match-ups against linebackers), Jeudy was an easy call.\n\nListed at 6-foot-1, 193 pounds, Jeudy caught 159 passes for 2,742 yards and 26 touchdowns for Alabama. He was a two-time first-team All-America selection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling and a surreal moment,\u201d Jeudy said. \u201cI\u2019m just thankful the hard work paid off.\u201d\n\nBarring a trade, the Broncos\u2019 next pick is No. 46 in Friday night\u2019s second round. They also have three third-round picks.\n\nThe Broncos used their first-round pick on an offensive player for the fourth time in five years and chose a receiver in the opening round for the first time since Demaryius Thomas in 2010 (No. 22 overall).\n\nDespite playing 41 games for Alabama, there was speculation earlier this week about the health of Jeudy\u2019s knees; he underwent surgery for a partial meniscus tear in April 2018.\n\nOn Thursday, though, Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban debunked any concerns about Jeudy\u2019s long-term durability.\n\n\u201cJerry Jeudy has nothing wrong with him,\u201d Saban said during a Sirius XM appearance. \u201cAbsolutely nothing. He never missed practice. He played in every game. Played in a bowl game when he didn\u2019t have to play.\u201d\n\nSaban called Jeudy a \u201cgreat all-around receiver. Great route runner.

Rob Guererra told us it was a bad idea in his Stats and Eggs Wednesday morning. Later on, you\u2019ll hear why Akash believes it\u2019s borderline \u201ccoaching malpractice\u201d to play Kittle.\n\nI disagree with all of that.\n\nBefore we make the argument for why Kittle should play, here is Kyle\u2019s quote from Tuesday:\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s healthy, I just don\u2019t see the reason why not to. That\u2019s the same as every other player on our roster. If you\u2019re healthy and you\u2019re not risking something, I mean, we would never ask him to play injured or anything like that, but he had a good week of practice last week. Most of the soreness was going away, and we\u2019re definitely going to test it again this week. But, when you have a guy, if he\u2019s a hundred percent healthy and stuff, how do you sit one guy and then look at everybody else in the eye on the team?\n\nThere probably isn\u2019t anybody playing out there a hundred percent healthy right now. So, when you are, there\u2019s a respect level that players have towards each other, and everyone goes through this whole thing. Players risk, every time they step on the field, no matter who you are, you\u2019re risking your career. That\u2019s what\u2019s tough about this sport, and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think players get paid enough, even though a lot of people would disagree with me on that.\n\nThere\u2019s not many people in the world that can do what you do, and you\u2019re risking your future every time you go out there, and that\u2019s no different for George. It\u2019s no different for all the other 52 guys on our roster. So, obviously, I don\u2019t want to get George hurt or anything like that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be overly cautious with it, and that\u2019s why we have been, but if someone\u2019s a hundred percent healthy, I can\u2019t look the rest of the team in the eye and tell them they have to play, but George doesn\u2019t. So, that\u2019s just part of having a team and part of treating people the right way.\u201d\n\nI understand the resistance to Kittle playing and the argument that superstar players get different treatment. Part of that conversation centers around this being a professional sport. The highest-paid tight end in NFL history isn\u2019t going to be treated like a sixth-round tight end out of Georgia. Plus, as Shanahan mentioned, it\u2019s a struggle for the 49ers to field a full team.\n\nThe example I used was the Los Angeles Clippers in the NBA this past season. Their superstar, Kawhi Leonard, was reportedly given treatment that nobody else on the team was afforded. Leonard showed up late to practice at times, flew in and out of LA on game day or practice, and wasn\u2019t a part of \u201cthe team.\u201d Players notice that and start to ask questions.\n\nWhat Shanahan was saying above speaks about the team culture. Kittle is healthy. I\u2019ve seen him run. He looks like No. 85. We have to assume that Kittle is healthy. Knowing that Kittle is healthy, you\u2019re going to get some funny looks when you address the team, and they see Kittle isn\u2019t playing. Shanahan mentioned that he\u2019d have to pull the likes of Fred Warner, Trent Williams, and perhaps another one of his best players if he were to give Kittle the \u201csuperstar\u201d treatment.\n\nTreating every player the same goes a long way. A lot of analysis ignores the human element. It also skips over Kittle being isolated in Arizona from his family and football being the one activity he can do. From creating the correct culture to accountability. I think many fans would be surprised to know that Shanahan does not hold back when it comes to \u201cpunishment.\u201d If Richard Sherman doesn\u2019t do his job, Kyle is going to tell him about it. If Dontae Johnson doesn\u2019t do his job, Kyle is going to tell him about it. The players have said they each appreciate how open and \u201creal\u201d Shanahan is toward them.\n\nNot playing a healthy player isn\u2019t in the cards for this team and that\u2019s not how Shanahan and the 49ers operate. When we throw out \u201cthere\u2019s an injury risk\u201d in a game where the best athletes in the world are running into each other full speed on each play, you\u2019re not adding anything to the conversation. These players don\u2019t have that same mindset. This is their job and their livelihood.

It\u2019s not about money, since Kittle\u2019s 2020 salary is fully guaranteed. Healthy players play. Kittle is healthy, so he\u2019ll play. Football players and coaches want to win.

After debuting on YouTube Premium in 2018, breakout spinoff \u201cCobra Kai\u201d moved to Netflix last year where the series, whose third season premiered on the platform New Year\u2019s Day, received more attention than ever. (Season 3 was originally produced for YouTube before the company shifted its original programming strategy.)\n\nRalph Macchio still remembers the moment it sunk in that he\u2019d get to come back for more as Daniel LaRusso, the scrawny San Fernando Valley teen befriended by Noriyuki \u201cPat\u201d Morita\u2019s martial arts master, Mr. Miyagi. \u201c[Producer] Jerry Weintraub put his arm around me at the end of a screening and said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna be making a couple of these,\u2019\u201d said Macchio, now 59.\n\nThe sleeper hit indeed spawned sequels, including the Okinawa, Japan,-set \u201cThe Karate Kid Part II\u201d in 1986 and \u201cPart III\u201d in 1989. A Saturday morning cartoon even reimagined Daniel and Mr. Miyagi as globe-trotting adventurers. But by the time a fourth film was made \u2014 1994\u2019s \u201cThe Next Karate Kid,\u201d starring Hilary Swank \u2014 Macchio and onscreen rival William Zabka, as blond bully Johnny Lawrence, were looking to branch out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason 3 finds washed-up karate teacher Johnny Lawrence (Zabka), along with the entire West Valley High community, dealing with the repercussions of a school karate brawl that left Miguel (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a) hospitalized. (Netflix)\n\nImprobably, the duo have slipped back into their roles decades later on \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d in which the middle-aged Johnny \u2014 a down-and-out alcoholic stuck in the glory days of his youth and still stinging from his defeat at the \u201984 All-Valley Karate Tournament \u2014 takes on his own teen protege, Miguel Diaz (Xolo Maridue\u00f1a), and reopens the dojo where he learned his all-American style of \u201cNo Mercy\u201d karate. Daniel, meanwhile, is a bonsai-pushing car salesman milking his karate glory to promote his business. The students have become the teachers \u2014 but are either of them their best selves?\n\n\u201cFor me, as much as the show is karate-centric, it\u2019s not about karate,\u201d said Zabka, 55, who has added work behind the camera to his resume in the intervening years, nabbing an Oscar nomination for the 2003 short \u201cMost.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about humans. It\u2019s about adults trying to find their way, putting things behind them, struggling. And that\u2019s what every character in the show has in some way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLikable characters, high-energy fights, suburban melodrama and '80s dad-rock have fueled the three seasons of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d to date, with a fourth already planned \u2014 and its semi-satirical approach to slinging nostalgia while expanding the \u201cKarate Kid\u201d mythology into a multigenerational saga has proved popular with audiences. On YouTube, the first episode has amassed more than 98 million views, and the third season swiftly unseated steamy Regency-era romance \u201cBridgerton\u201d in Netflix\u2019s ranking of its top 10 TV shows.\n\nFor creators Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg and Josh Heald, spinning the films they grew up on into a fresh narrative \u2014 and dreaming up new characters, like Daniel\u2019s teenage daughter Samantha (Mary Mouser), Johnny\u2019s estranged son Robby (Tanner Buchanan) and Cobra Kai\u2019s star student Miguel \u2014 has allowed them to dive ever deeper into surprisingly poignant themes.\n\nExamining how Johnny and Daniel each remain chained to the past, for example, was a fertile springboard for contrasting how their worldviews had diverged so starkly. \u201cWe try to approach our characters not from a place of judgment but from a place of understanding,\u201d said Hurwitz. \u201cAnd by doing that you\u2019re allowing for the possibility that anyone has the potential to grow and anyone has the potential to evolve and progress in this world.\u201d\n\nIn the series\u2019 heightened, karate-obsessed version of the San Fernando Valley, ex-jock Johnny teaches his aggro style to a school of misfits while Daniel revives Miyagi-Do in his late mentor\u2019s memory. As their bitter rivalry escalates, \u201cCobra Kai\u201d explores more complex emotions as characters learn the hard way that there are no bad students, only bad teachers \u2014 and that violent karate brawls do, in fact, have grave consequences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary Mouser as Samantha LaRusso and and Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso in \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d (Netflix)\n\nFor its next-gen stars, the series is already opening doors, especially with the jump to Netflix.\n\n\u201c\u2018Cobra Kai\u2019 has been a huge shift for me, career-wise,\u201d said Mouser, 24, who hadn\u2019t done stunt-intensive work until being cast as the next LaRusso and jumped at the chance to don a gi when her character reignited her love of karate in the second season. \u201cNo matter who it was, we were all treated as equals and as fellow creatives, and that was a turning point for me: This is what it feels like to have my voice heard and to feel like I\u2019m cocreating this character.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike his cast mates, Buchanan, 22, saw his social media following skyrocket when the show hit Netflix. After a decade of credits including \u201cDesignated Survivor\u201d and \u201cThe Fosters,\u201d his portrayal of misunderstood karate prodigy Robby brought new opportunities. Buchanan is now looking for projects to produce and wrapped a lead role in Miramax\u2019s \u201cHe\u2019s All That,\u201d a gender-flipped remake of \u201cShe\u2019s All That.\u201d \u201cI know I got that meeting a little bit,\u201d he said of the producers, \u201cbecause they were like, \u2018We just binge-watched \u201cCobra Kai\u201d.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaridue\u00f1a, 19, made his screen debut on \u201cParenthood,\u201d a show he credits with turning acting from something to do to pay for college to a full-on career. The native Angeleno landed the role of Miguel, the neighbor kid who eagerly strikes up a LaRusso/Miyagi dynamic with Johnny, during his own junior year of high school. It\u2019s not lost on him that when he won the \u201cCobra Kai\u201d role, his casting was heralded as a groundbreaking role for a Latino performer. Now his goals include getting behind the camera and powering his own inclusive projects.\n\n\u201cWhile I would love that inch to turn into a mile. It needs to be just the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe stories that I want to write are stories that are authentic to the people that I grew up with.\u201d\n\nThe key to the series remains its deft interweaving of past and present with the DNA of the original films. After bringing back \u201cKarate Kid\u201d villain John Kreese (Martin Kove), who promptly orchestrates a hostile takeover of Johnny\u2019s students, \u201cCobra Kai\u201d doubles down on the sadistic dojo founder\u2019s Vietnam War backstory in its third season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKreese\u2019s elevation, and the heightened scrutiny that comes with being embraced by one of the most powerful companies in Hollywood, also underscores the fact that there are now three white men at the center of \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d a franchise rooted in and deeply indebted to Eastern tradition. Morita, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance in the first film and died in 2005, appears in flashbacks in the series, and both Yuji Okumoto and Tamlyn Tomita reprise their roles \u2014 as Daniel\u2019s rival and ex-flame, respectively \u2014 from \u201cPart II\u201d in Season 3 guest arcs. Supporting characters of color also saw expanded roles in the new season. But after 30 episodes on two platforms, \u201cCobra Kai\u201d has yet to cast an Asian lead.\n\nMore than three decades after the original \u201cKarate Kid,\u201d Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), left, Cobra Kai founder John Kreese (Martin Kove) and Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) square off in a three-way karate battle for the soul of the Valley in the Netflix series. (Netflix)\n\n\u201cExcept for the Latino character of Miguel, all the other people of color are outside of that main cast, so it actually doesn\u2019t show as a diverse show in a sense,\u201d said Ana-Christina Ram\u00f3n, coauthor of UCLA\u2019s annual Hollywood Diversity Report, which designates leads as the top eight credited regular actors. (Across the industry, the report found that white characters made up 75.9% of the leads in digital scripted series like \u201cCobra Kai\u201d in the 2018-2019 season, while 5.9% of leads were Latinx, 4.7% were Black and just 1.8% were Asian.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA number of critics have taken notice of the series\u2019 whiteness as well: Salon culture senior editor Hanh Nguyen, who has been critical of the series in the past, told The Times that \u201cthe only main character of color who has any sort of interiority is Miguel.\u201d \u201cDanny LaRusso, Italian kid from Jersey,\u201d as Vanity Fair\u2019s Sonia Saraiya put it about the first two seasons, \u201cis the most Japanese character on this show.\u201d\n\nAs Times TV critic Lorraine Ali writes, \u201cCobra Kai\u201d has successfully mined laughs and pathos from Johnny\u2019s transformation through his proximity to an immigrant family. It\u2019s also scrutinized how Kreese\u2019s brand of karate perpetuates a cycle of militant toxic masculinity. But it has been slow to explore Daniel\u2019s own blind spots beyond a moment of clueless \u201csushi-splaining\u201d and his bewilderment that his karate-chopping commercials might be seen as cultural appropriation.\n\n\u201cThe thing I\u2019d like to see them do is to go beyond this suburban idyllic space, this white pocket dimension, more deeply,\u201d said writer and podcaster Jeff Yang, who has covered the series for Quartz. \u201cWhat if they actually did encounter people who embraced martial arts not just to overcome bullying, but because it\u2019s part of a larger tradition that exists within people of color communities?\u201d\n\nSending Daniel back to Okinawa in the third season to reunite with Kumiko (Tomita) and Chozen (Okumoto) is a step in that direction, allowing the show to \u201cfeel what was missing,\u201d said Heald. \u201cTo acknowledge that there\u2019s a big missing piece because of Mr. Miyagi and come to the point of appreciating that it\u2019s not just Mr. Miyagi, it\u2019s everything that he touched and that touched him.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTamlyn Tomita reprises her role of Kumiko, from 1986\u2019s \u201cThe Karate Kid Part II,\u201d in \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d (Tina Rowden / Netflix)\n\nThe return, which Macchio himself had pushed for and on which Tomita and Okumoto consulted, results in some of the series\u2019 most resonant payoffs. \u201cI wanted him to evolve as a character,\u201d said Okumoto of the once dangerously prideful Chozen. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him just to be there as a person to push the story along. I wanted him to go through a journey, to go through a soul-searching.\u201d\n\nHeald, Hurwitz and Schlossberg, who are writing the fourth season, say they\u2019re well aware of the criticisms. \u201cHaving made \u2018Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\u2019 we\u2019ve been particularly sensitive to Asian American representation in movies and television,\u201d said Schlossberg of the 2004 comedy, starring John Cho and Kal Penn, which he cowrote with Hurwitz. While there are no writers of Asian descent on the \u201cCobra Kai\u201d writing staff, the trio emphasized that when it comes to elements such as G\u014dj\u016b-ry\u016b karate, on which the Miyagi-Do style is based, and certain Japanese cultural details, they have leaned on actors like Tomita, Okumoto, stunt coordinator Hiro Koda and original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen for guidance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe would have loved if there was a Miyagi son or daughter that was floating around in the lineage and the canon of the movie to play with,\u201d said Heald. \u201cBut we inherited the story that felt like the natural continuation, where for better or worse you are dealing with Johnny and Daniel as your protagonists.\u201d\n\nMaridue\u00f1a, who credited the showrunners for thoughtfully integrating Ecuadorian heritage into Miguel\u2019s story, acknowledged that the world of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d doesn\u2019t always reflect the diversity of its San Fernando Valley setting, which according to 2019 U.S. Census figures is 42% Hispanic. \u201cIf you live in the Valley, and really the greater Los Angeles area, you know there are so many different Latinos, Black people, people of Asian descent,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd while our show is catching up, I think a lot of shows, like everything in Hollywood, feel like they\u2019re catching up slowly.\u201d\n\nSchlossberg cited casting limitations in Atlanta, where the show is filmed. \u201cWhen it comes to background casting, we are limited [in] making a high school on our show look exactly like a high school would look in Reseda,\u201d he said. (According to U.S. Census figures, Hispanics comprise 5% of the population of Atlanta and 10% of the population of Georgia, while Asians make up 5% of the population in the city and 4% statewide. Atlanta is 48% Black, while Georgia as a whole is 32%.)\n\nYet visual representation such as that seen in the hallways of a high school is just the first step toward meaningful representation, said Ram\u00f3n. \u201cDo you get to hear their stories being told? Meaningful representation means you get to find out the person\u2019s story from their perspective.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs they ride their Netflix bump into the first season produced in COVID-19 times and under the streamer\u2019s banner, the creators declined to comment on details of upcoming seasons. They did, however confirm that introducing characters of Asian descent \u201cis definitely something that is in our plans going forward\u201d and teased the possibility that familiar faces like Aisha, the kindhearted Cobra Kai student (played by actress Nichole Brown) who was conspicuously written out of Season 3, could very well come back to West Valley High in the future. \u201cAny character who has appeared in the \u2018Karate Kid\u2019 universe has the potential to return,\u201d said Hurwitz.\n\nMaking more seasons means more chances to bring new characters in, they say. \u201cEach season as we\u2019re writing, we\u2019re looking for new underdog stories and new characters to populate the universe,\u201d said Heald. \u201cWe always have our eye towards representing today\u2019s society as richly and as accurately as possible.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re gonna be making a couple of these.\n\n\u2018Cobra Kai\u2019\n\n\n\nWhere: Netflix\n\n\n\nWhen: Any time\n\n\n\nRated: TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under the age of 14)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/coronavirus-outbreak-us-cases-chicago-rhode-island", "authors": ["Amanda Holpuch"], "title": "Coronavirus outbreak: US confirms cases in Chicago and Rhode Island", "text": "US health secretary Alex Azar has confirmed a new case of coronavirus in Chicago, as the respiratory illness spreads in the US.\n\nYes, it is worse than the flu: busting the coronavirus myths Read more\n\nAlso on Sunday, Rhode Island announced its first known case.

And we\u2019re going to work to protect the American people with every tool that we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nThe US has around 60 confirmed cases. Worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, 85,000 people have been sickened and more than 2,800 have died, most of them in China. A 60-year-old US citizen died in Wuhan in early February.\n\nMost coronavirus infections result in mild symptoms including coughing and fever, though some can become more serious and lead to pneumonia. Older people, especially those with chronic illnesses such as heart or lung disease, are especially vulnerable. Health officials think the virus spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in the US is considered small, but the increase in diagnoses seems to have stemmed from expanded testing. Azar said 3,600 people had been tested in the US. South Korea has tested more than 35,000.\n\nUntil late last week, the only population advised to be tested for coronavirus was people experiencing flu-like symptoms who had traveled to an area with an outbreak or had contact with someone who did. On Thursday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing guidelines expanded to include people hospitalized with severe lower respiratory illness.\n\nWhat is coronavirus and what should I do if I have symptoms?

The agency announced on Friday that it had developed a workaround and people could use those kits again.\n\nAzar said this problem was separate from the CDC\u2019s ability to test for coronavirus, which has not been delayed.

Bagdasarian emphasized that student-athletes will not be required to have three negative tests in order to compete.\n\n\u201cBy entering in (the pilot program), they would agree to testing student-athletes three times a week, reporting those results, making sure that they have what they need to be fully trained and have personal protective equipment available, and that they have protocols in place in case someone tests positive,\u201d she said. \u201cIf they adhere to these protocols and their requirements, we are hoping athletic activities can continue in a safe and controlled way.\u201d\n\nBagdasarian said the tests do not have to be administered by a professional health care worker. However, she again emphasized that school officials must undergo the training provided by the MDHHS via video to administer the tests.\n\n\u201cThe test is almost like a home pregnancy test, and it can be run by someone who has been through the training process and watched the video,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a couple of regulatory requirements. There needs to be a certificate of waiver that they can run these tests in a non-laboratory setting. The state is obtaining a clear waiver for all the participating schools.\n\n\u201cThe next part is we have done our first webinar today and we had someone from our bureau of laboratories show an example of what the tests look like and give a brief overview on to actually run the test. We have training videos available on our website, so we are going to ask schools that are interested in participating to watch those training videos and learn how to do the tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not anything too difficult, but they have to be familiar with the process and how it works exactly. Once they watch the training video, we are going to do a proper training session with someone from our bureau of laboratories where again she will go through the steps and make sure everyone is on the same page.\u201d\n\nThis marks the third time that the fall sports season has been paused. The most recent pause came after the MDHHS released a set of restrictions, that included the closure of all Michigan high schools on Nov. 18. Those restrictions were later extended on Dec. 8 and were set to expire Dec. 20. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced Dec. 18 that schools could reopen Jan. 4, and the MDHHS introduced the testing pilot program.\n\n\u201c2020 has been a tough year for many of us around the state, and an especially tough year for kids and students who were not able to participate in school and sports consistently,\u201d Bagdasarian said. \u201cWe are really excited to partner with the MHSAA and try to at least give people this glimmer of hope that they can at least get some normalcy back into their lives.\u201d", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2020/10/16/924295895/needing-the-support-of-catholic-women-democrats-are-careful-with-amy-coney-barre", "authors": ["Tom Gjelten"], "title": "Needing The Support Of Catholic Women, Democrats Are Careful With Amy Coney Barrett", "text": "Needing The Support Of Catholic Women, Democrats Are Careful With Amy Coney Barrett\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Patrick Semansky/Pool/AP Patrick Semansky/Pool/AP\n\nIn Amy Coney Barrett, President Trump put forward a Supreme Court nominee who embodies a set of voters the Democrats need on their side to win elections. She's a well-educated, white, suburban Catholic woman.\n\nMany Democrats object to her well-documented conservative views in such areas as abortion, health care, guns and immigrant rights, but they must tread carefully in opposing her nomination so as not to alienate those voters, especially women, who may be inspired by Barrett's life story.\n\n\"What Barrett represents for me is someone who shares my values,\" said Ashley McKinless, 30, a columnist at America Magazine, a Jesuit publication. McKinless considers herself a progressive feminist, but she opposes abortion on moral grounds.\n\n\"To see those values represented by a woman at the highest levels of the U.S. government has been moving for me,\" McKinless said. \"It's not the typical person we talk about when we have conversations about feminism, but I do see my own pro-life feminism reflected in her.\"\n\nFor some women, Barrett's public celebration of her family life was another aspect of her appeal. She and her husband have seven children, and she brought them with her to her confirmation hearings.\n\n\"I'm used to being in a group of nine \u2013 my family,\" Barrett said in her opening statement. \"Nothing is more important to me.\"\n\nAmong those impressed by that example was Erika Bachiochi, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.\n\n\"Barrett's life story puzzles older feminists,\" Bachiochi wrote in a column for Politico. \"Bearing and raising a bevy of children has long implied retaining a traditional life script \u2013 like staying home with the children \u2013 that Barrett has obviously not heeded. An enigma to many, she doesn't fit easily into any ideological box.\"\n\nMindful that Catholics are a key swing voter group, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee this week have been exceedingly careful not to critique Barrett's strong Catholic faith. They have followed the counsel of their presidential candidate, Joe Biden, himself a faithful Catholic. As Barrett's confirmation hearings opened on Monday, Biden warned, \"I don't think there should be any questions about her faith.\"\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who in 2017 was widely criticized for telling Barrett that \"the dogma lives loudly within you,\" avoided any such comments this week.\n\n\"We all have our moral values,\" she told Barrett. \"We have our religions. We live by that. I respect you and your family for doing just that.\"\n\nSome Catholics, nevertheless, say they feel pressure from Democrats not to speak too loudly about their faith beliefs unless it's to reinforce Democratic policy positions such as support for health care, immigrants or other social justice issues.\n\n\"I think the shift of the Democratic Party to become more and more secular and more extremist in terms of its abortion policies has left progressive religious people with only so much they can contribute to the conversation,\" said McKinless, who co-hosts a podcast on faith issues.\n\n\"If you want to be taken seriously on the left, and you're a person of faith,\" McKinless said, \"it doesn't seem like talking about issues beyond things like the economy and immigration is going to be very fruitful for you. It might just make your voice irrelevant.\"\n\nMcKinless said she commiserates with \"a lot of Catholics who often describe themselves as politically homeless.\"\n\nAt the same time, McKinless emphasizes that discontent with the Democratic Party and a celebration of Barrett's nomination to the Supreme Court do not automatically translate into positive feelings toward Trump.\n\n\"I think you can support Amy Coney Barrett and see her as a very capable nominee for the Supreme Court and not necessarily see that as a reflection of President Trump,\" she said. \"I think this was a calculated decision on his part. He knows what his base wants in terms of a Supreme Court nominee, and she checked all the boxes.\"\n\nPolitics Bipartisan Christian Group Forms Super PAC To Oppose Trump Bipartisan Christian Group Forms Super PAC To Oppose Trump Listen \u00b7 6:52 6:52\n\nMcKinless is one of an increasing number of moderate faith voices who are more outspoken in this election cycle than in previous years, often affirming their anti-abortion views while still opposing Trump.\n\nMore than 5,000 people have signed an online petition organized by a group, Pro-Life Evangelicals for Biden, including several prominent seminary leaders, as well as Jerushah Duford, an evangelical writer and granddaughter of the late Billy Graham.\n\nDuford is also one of the organizers of a new anti-Trump super PAC, Not Our Faith, targeting Christian voters in key battleground states.\n\nAnother co-founder of the group, Autumn Hanna VandeHei, told NPR's Rachel Martin this week that a focus on the abortion issue, among Democrats as well as Republicans, has contributed to political polarization in the country.\n\n\"[You have] each side calling the other side evil, within the Christian community,\" she said. \"I think it's really important to show that this single issue shouldn't be the defining factor when we have so many other things at stake.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.tennis.com/pro-game/2019/06/french-open-grand-slam-breakthroughs-rafael-nadal-stopped-history/81703/", "authors": [], "title": "From the breakthrough Slam to nearly unbreakable: Rafa's Paris script", "text": "The dominance of tennis\u2019 Big 3\u2014Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic\u2014in Grand Slam tournaments has been a spellbinding screenplay for nearly a decade. But at the French Open, one player has been scripting a predominantly predictable series for even longer.\n\nThroughout Open Era tennis, the French Open has been regarded as the Slam of breakthroughs. Paris often afforded players the chance to trade in supporting roles for an audition to land the headlining hero. From all-time greats like Bjorn Borg and Ivan Lendl, to clay-court connoisseurs Guillermo Vilas and Gustavo Kuerten, to one-Slam wonders Yannick Noah and Gaston Gaudio, Roland Garros embraced diversity in the portrayal of its male champion character.\n\nWhen Nadal lifted his first Coupe des Mousquetaires in 2005, he became the 21st man out of 49 to clinch his maiden major at Roland Garros. At that point in time, the French Open accounted for 42.86% of the ATP\u2019s first-time major champions. The next closest, the US Open, owned less than half that number, with 20.41% (10 players), followed by the Australian Open and Wimbledon with 18.37% each (9 players).\n\nSince 2005, the French Open story viewers tune in for has been executively produced by Nadal\u2014with eleven titles in 14 years, a pristine 11-0 record in championship matches and just two defeats along the way. Federer, Djokovic and Stan Wawrinka each delivered memorable performances to grab the spotlight at one point during the show, but for the majority of screen time, it's shone exclusively on Nadal.\n\nIf you remove the Spaniard from the director\u2019s chair, Federer and Djokovic each have a compelling case for numerous additions to their major tallies: they are a combined 1-11 at the event against Nadal, including an 0-6 mark in title matches. But arguably everyone Nadal has taken out during the second week in Paris has a valid claim, as the tale of the tape points to another distinctive narrative the 11-time champion cut in the editing room.\n\nOn four occasions, Roland Garros sustained runs of at least three consecutive breakthrough winners, and it never took more than five years for history to repeat itself: 1982-84 (Mats Wilander, Noah and Lendl); 1989-91 (Michael Chang, Andres Gomez and Jim Courier); 1995-98 (Thomas Muster, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Kuerten and Carlos Moya); and 2002-05 (Albert Costa, Juan Carlos Ferrero, Gaudio and Nadal). The only other time this happened at a major was at the Australian Open, in 1976 (Mark Edmundson), January 1977 (Roscoe Tanner) and December 1977 (Vitas Gerulaitis).\n\nNadal\u2019s retired countrymen David Ferrer and Nicolas Almagro have two of the strongest petitions, especially Ferrer, who hung up his racquet in Madrid this month. The former world No. 3 bowed out to Nadal four times in the quarterfinal stage or later at Roland Garros, including the 2013 final. Almagro was sent packing by the left-hander in quarterfinals three times over a five-year period from 2008-2012.\n\nWith this season marking 14 years since Nadal piloted his first of an 11-episode series, audiences await in anticipation on whether he is renewed, Djokovic or Federer is rebooted, or an evolving project like Dominic Thiem is green-lit.\n\nNote: Through 2005 Roland Garros, the French Open also led women\u2019s breakthrough winners with 38.71% (12 of 31 players). The Australian Open was second at 22.58% (7 players), with Wimbledon and the US Open tying with 19.35% (6 players). The French Open has since held the pole position with six of the past 17 first-time major titlists, just ahead of the US Open, which features five.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/2020/02/12/outriders-trailer/", "authors": [], "title": "'Outriders' trailer reveals a superhuman co-op shooter", "text": "The trailer is characterized as a blend of \"gameplay, cinematics and game-engine capture,\" although it's not clear which is which, or what platform the trailer is running on.

Lawyers said they were taken without her consent, by photographers hiding in bushes.\n\nThe couple say they want a different relationship with the media now they've stepped back from their life as senior royals. But have the rules changed? And what can they expect now that they've left the UK?\n\nHow much privacy can the couple expect?\n\nNot much, according to Ingrid Seward, a royal biographer and editor of Majesty Magazine. She says she's surprised the couple weren't expecting the paparazzi to follow them to Canada.\n\n\"Of course the safest place for Harry and Meghan to be is in the UK,\" she told Radio 4's PM programme. \"They haven't been papped once since their marriage, and if they have been, no pictures have been printed.\n\n\"Those rules don't apply in Canada. The paps can come from all over the world and lie in wait for them.\"\n\nThe couple are believed to be alarmed by press activity near their current base on Vancouver Island, British Columbia.\n\nTheir lawyers say there have been attempts to photograph inside their home using long-range lenses and they accuse the paparazzi of being camped outside the property.\n\nPR and media expert Rebecca May says that without the long-standing \"gentleman's\" agreement between the Palace and the UK media to avoid using paparazzi photos, Harry and Meghan \"will have to navigate their way through this new world without that protection\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The press have descended on Vancouver Island, near where the couple are believed to be staying\n\nThe CHEK news service, based in Vancouver Island, was one of the outlets which decided not to use the photo - taken in Horth Hill Regional Park - that prompted the legal warning.\n\nIts news editor, Scott Fee, says he spoke to the photographer responsible who defended it, saying it was taken on public property.\n\nHe told BBC Breakfast: \"That's [the photographer's] version. He said Meghan didn't hide from the shot, she gave me a smile, she didn't prevent it from happening - those are his words. If that's how it played out - it's hard to say.\"\n\nMr Fee says his publication chose not to use the pictures, which appeared on the front page of the Sun, because they had to listen to their audience, who tend to be really protective of the couple.\n\nHe adds: \"We do want to respect what the couple are saying as well. We're not looking to be intrusive, we're not looking to stalk the couple.\"\n\nHowever, he does acknowledge that his organisation will be closely following the story as it \"unfolds in our own backyard\".\n\nWhat's the couple's relationship with the media?\n\nPrince Harry has long had an uneasy relationship with the media, having grown up aware of the impact the intense media interest had on the life of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nShe died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi on motorbikes.\n\nThe prince has often compared his wife's experiences of the press with those of his late mother.\n\nIn 2016, Prince Harry attacked the media for subjecting Meghan - then his girlfriend - to a \"wave of abuse and harassment\".\n\nLast year, Harry accepted damages and an apology from a news agency which used a helicopter to take photographs of the inside of his home in the Cotswolds.\n\nThe duchess is currently suing the Mail on Sunday over publishing one of her private letters to her father, Thomas Markle, accusing the paper of misusing her private information, breaching copyright and selective editing.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Meghan has had close ties to Canada for many years, although she is an American citizen by birth\n\nDays after confirming his wife's legal case, the duke announced he would take legal action against the owners of the Sun, the defunct News of the World, and the Daily Mirror, in relation to alleged phone-hacking.\n\nIn his statement last October, the prince singled out Britain's tabloid newspapers, saying that they had ruined his mother's life and he wouldn't let them ruin his wife's.\n\nBBC media editor Amol Rajan says the way to stay out of the media is not to be too interesting, adding that recent events have, ironically, seen interest in the Sussexes \"radically increase\".\n\nHe says: \"If you want to stay out of the media, it's not about where you are, it's about who you are and what you do.\n\n\"There is something desperately sad for the couple in the fact that, even in North America, you cannot get away from scrutiny - given that every passer-by has a smartphone.\"\n\nDon't the couple need publicity for their careers?\n\nUnder their new arrangement with the royal family, Harry and Meghan will stop receiving public funds for royal duties.\n\nHowever, the couple will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations, while they have previously said they plan to launch a new \"charitable entity\".\n\nPR and media expert Rebecca May says it is crucial that the couple's advisers \"guide them through this new maze and keep Canada's press on side to help with this transition period\".\n\nShe says: \"After all, to raise awareness for their charities and causes they need the media to spread the word. Therefore the key is to set boundaries and stick to them.\n\n\"Be up front and open with the press and they will be respectful if they know what rules you play by.\"\n\nImage copyright Downtown Eastside Women's Center Image caption The Duchess of Sussex visited a women's centre in Vancouver last week\n\nShe anticipates \"a bumpy ride\" for at least the next 12 months for the couple, adding that it will also very much depend on their next career moves.\n\n\"Inevitably, I don't see their move to Canada helping them stay out of the media spotlight in the short to medium term, however, in the long term it could be a good move for them.\"\n\nNewspapers have claimed that Harry appeared to tout Meghan for voiceover work with Disney at the Lion King premiere in July.\n\nThe couple have previously looked to capitalise on the Sussex Royal brand - lodging an application to trademark the name in June last year, covering items such as books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising and campaigning.\n\nIt raised the possibility of Prince Harry and Meghan launching their own lines of products, from beauty to clothing - however the agreement with the Queen has cast doubt on that idea.\n\nA brand incorporating the word \"royal\" may not be compatible with their agreement to step back from royal duties.\n\nHow does the law in the UK compare to Canada?\n\nIn the UK, you can generally take pictures of people in public spaces without permission. But there could be circumstances where it is not allowed, for example if the person was in an area where they reasonably expected privacy or your actions amounted to harassment.\n\nCanadian privacy laws are similar to those in the UK, but there are also provincial statutes in Canada.\n\nIn the province of British Columbia, where Prince Harry and Meghan are staying, a separate Privacy Act is in force. In a public place, there may be a limited expectation of privacy under certain circumstances.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Scores of photographers followed Meghan at official events in the UK\n\nCanadian media lawyer Dan Burnett has worked on a number of privacy cases in the province and says the key question for the courts is whether there is \"a reasonable expectation of privacy\".\n\nHe says: \"Factors such as children and surreptitious photography would be important considerations supporting the potential claim in Meghan's case.\n\n\"The fact it was in a public place would lean the other way, but if the photographers were hiding, that suggests they knew she considered it a safe, private space at the time.\"\n\nHowever, there is still a public interest exemption in Canada which could be used by journalists and photographers in some cases. A court considering a case would also have to take freedom of the press into account.\n\nThe privacy laws in Canada haven't been as stringently tested as in the UK - with there being less of a paparazzi culture - so it is unclear what scenarios would amount to an invasion of privacy.\n\nIn the UK, privacy rights began to change with the passage of the Human Rights Act in 1998, which introduced a right to \"respect for private and family life\".\n\nThe result has been a series of rulings against the media, such as Max Mosley who successfully sued the News of the World for breach of privacy, after it had published pictures of him with five prostitutes.\n\nSir Cliff Richard used the same privacy law in 2018 to win his case against the BBC, which had showed helicopter footage of a police raid on his home.\n\nWhat is the global interest in royal pictures?\n\nRebecca May says Prince Harry and Meghan's move to Canada is drawing press attention from \"all across the globe\" and exclusive paparazzi photos could be \"worth hundreds of thousands of pounds\".\n\nShe says: \"There are extreme lengths photographers may go to to get 'the photo'. You can expect bidding wars for exclusive images.\"\n\nPress intrusion is not a new problem for the royals, as Meghan's sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, would testify.\n\nIn 2017, Catherine was awarded \u00a392,000 in damages after a French magazine printed topless pictures of her in 2012.\n\nAt the time of the judgement, BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield said the guilty verdict was not a surprise, adding \"it's almost a game these magazine play\".\n\nHe said: \"They get the fines but they think it's worth it - they get the extra sales from the photographs they publish.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The paparazzi were accused of harassing two-year-old Prince George in 2015\n\nAnd the paparazzi have also targeted the royals' children. In 2015, Kensington Palace issued an appeal to world media not to publish unauthorised images of two-year-old Prince George.\n\nThe palace said some paparazzi had gone to \"extreme lengths\" to take pictures and \"a line has been crossed\".\n\nA small number of media organisations, mostly in Germany, France, Australia, New Zealand and the US, had published photos of Prince George in \"unacceptable circumstances\", it said.\n\nHowever the palace said the \"vast majority\" - and all UK publications - had refused.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2020/09/23/wisconsin-coronavirus-state-reports-more-than-1-700-cases-wednesday/3507412001/", "authors": [], "title": "Coronavirus in Wisconsin: State reports fourth-highest case count ever, continues to struggle with surge", "text": "Wisconsin reported its fourth-highest daily coronavirus case count ever Wednesday, with more than 1,700 new cases.\n\nThe three days with higher counts all came within the last week.\n\nFor much of September, the state has struggled with rapidly rising case counts, especially among young people, as colleges and universities have reopened.\n\nCases are on the rise for every age group and ethnicity.

Share Shares Copy Link Copy\n\nWhat are the potential long-term effects of having COVID-19?It's hard to say exactly, because the coronavirus is still so new that scientists don't know much about long-term effects. The best evidence comes from patients themselves, and some experience a variety of symptoms long after their infections have cleared.Most people recover within a few weeks. For people who experience longer-term effects, the most common issues are bouts of exhaustion, headaches, anxiety and muscle aches that can last for at least several more weeks.Patients who required intensive care, including those put on ventilators or kidney dialysis, can experience more serious issues.Lung scarring can occur in people who developed pneumonia. Heart inflammation, irregular heartbeats, and worsening kidney and liver function have been reported as well. However, it's too soon to know if those could be permanent problems.Survivors who had long intensive-care stays sometimes need oxygen therapy or dialysis at home. Some also develop a condition called post-intensive care syndrome, which can include persistent muscle weakness and memory problems. That can happen after any critical illness and may be related to sedation and prolonged bed confinement during hospitalization.Blood clots can also develop during and after COVID-19 infections, occasionally causing strokes. Even in less serious cases, blood thinners are prescribed and can require lifestyle changes to reduce risks of bleeding.Most symptoms appear to eventually go away, said Dr. Thomas McGinn of the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research in New York, who was involved in one of the largest U.S. studies of COVID-19 patients.\u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when. For some patients it may take longer than others,\" McGinn said.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/asia/china-xi-jinping-wuhan-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html", "authors": ["James Griffiths"], "title": "China coronavirus: Xi Jinping visits virus-hit Wuhan in major show of confidence", "text": "Hong Kong (CNN) Chinese President Xi Jinping has made his first visit to Wuhan since the novel coronavirus outbreak began more than two months ago, as new cases of the virus slowed to a trickle in the country where the disease first emerged.\n\nXi's visit to Wuhan -- which has been on lockdown for weeks now, with tens of thousands of confirmed cases of the virus and hundreds of deaths -- is a major show of confidence in China's response to the pandemic , underlining a message which has been building in state media that the country has turned a corner.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have been 80,754 cases of the virus confirmed across China, 67,760 of which were in Hubei, the province of which Wuhan is the capital.

The countries' leaders are expected to meet at the G20 summit in Japan next week.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump had said he would consider extending tariffs to another $300 billion of Chinese goods if his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping does not yield progress on the trade dispute.\n\nThe new round of tariffs would reduce Apple's competitiveness and cut the contribution it could make to the U.S. Treasury, Apple said in an online filing on Thursday.\n\nApple said in the document it is the largest U.S. corporate taxpayer to the U.S. Treasury and reiterated its 2018 pledge to directly contribute over $350 billion to the U.S. economy over five years.\n\nApple said it would also take a hit because Chinese and other non-U.S. firms do not have a significant U.S. market presence.\n\n\"A U.S. tariff would, therefore, tilt the playing field in favor of our global competitors,\" Apple said.\n\nThe levies would also hit AirPods, Apple TVs and batteries and parts.

They loaded the bases with one out in the third and again with no outs in the seventh, but both times failed to score. Their only offense came via a trio of solo home runs, one from Mitch Moreland off Stroman in the sixth, and from Rafael Devers and Jackie Bradley Jr. in the eighth off the Toronto bullpen. Bradley homered in the series opener on Monday, too, giving him home runs in back-to-back games for the fourth time in his career.\n\nThe polite way to put it would be to say that the law of averages was in effect Tuesday night. Stroman got plenty of run support, while Rodriguez had nowhere to hide in a 10-3 Blue Jays win in the second of a four-game series.\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Before the first pitch, Eduardo Rodriguez was 4-2 with a 4.89 ERA. He\u2019d gotten 77 runs of support from the Red Sox in his nine starts. Marcus Stroman, who got the ball for the Blue Jays, was 1-6 with a 2.95 ERA. He\u2019d gotten 22 runs of support in his 10 starts.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of traffic out there,\u201d said Red Sox manager Alex Cora. \u201c[Stroman] made some pitches when he had to and he got the W.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCora couldn\u2019t say the same for his starter, Rodriguez, who gave up three home runs as part of a five-inning outing in which he allowed six hits and six runs with three walks and five strikeouts. Rodriguez (4-3, 5.43) threw 95 pitches, 57 for strikes. He had not allowed a home run in his previous five starts but wound up tying a season high with six earned runs allowed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToronto struck first in the fourth when Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (2 for 5 with two runs and a strikeout) singled and Rodriguez gave up back-to-back homers to Rowdy Tellez and Randal Grichuk to make it 3-0.\n\n\u201cThe last homer was supposed to be a slider down and away and I missed it in the middle, and the changeup on the first homer was right in the middle, too,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nAfter Grichuk\u2019s home run, Cora took the unusual step of going to see Rodriguez on the mound. Typically, pitching coach Dana LeVangie would do that, and it looked like evidence of mounting frustration over Rodriguez\u2019s performance on Cora\u2019s part, but the manager said after the game he just had a piece of information he wanted to share with his pitcher.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t upset. It was something that I saw,\u201d Cora said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like body language or whatever.\u201d\n\nCora said what he\u2019d noticed was \u201cbaseball stuff\u201d and something he\u2019s talked to Rodriguez about before, but didn\u2019t want to be more specific in case other opponents picked up on something to search for. Cora did note that the fourth-inning homer run by Tellez was not the first time this season Rodriguez has been burned by a changeup he\u2019s failed to get down and in, and that the Red Sox are trying to solve some problems the lefthander seems to be having against lefty hitters.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your job, lefty-lefty, so it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve got to get in the bullpen and working on it and fix it,\u201d said Rodriguez, who\u2019s been dominant against lefthanded hitters in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fifth inning went much like the fourth for Rodriguez. Guerrero singled again, then Justin Smoak walked, and the lefthanded-hitting Tellez hit his second home run of the game to add another three runs. For Tellez, it was the first multi-home run game of his career.\n\nRodriguez was replaced by Tyler Thornburg in the sixth. Thornburg promptly gave up two walks and two singles, allowing another two runs. He got out of the inning and was replaced for the seventh by Colten Brewer, who gave up another two runs.\n\nThere weren\u2019t many bright spots for the Red Sox, but Cora was still optimistic when it was over and said he didn\u2019t feel like the team was scuffling again.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t make pitches today, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Cora said. \u201cBut we come here to win the series and we won one, we\u2019ve got two games to go so you know, it hasn\u2019t been actually that bad. Today, the home runs, we paid a price, but the whole week we\u2019ve been playing good baseball.\u201d\n\nNora Princiotti can be reached at nora.princiotti@globe.com.

While many of those cancellations go on behind the scenes, earlier this year the game Rush Wars was cancelled three months after its beta release.\n\nThis decision, as with past decisions to kill games, was made by its development team, said Paananen:\n\n\"The team behind the game killed it because based on the beta, they felt like this was not going to be a game that lots of people would play for years nor would it be remembered forever,\" he wrote. \"The early gameplay was lots of fun, but it just did not carry over to the endgame.\n\n\"I feel proud of the decision the team made. I cannot even imagine how painful it is to kill your own darling, something that you've poured your heart and soul into. That said, this is how we all want Supercell to operate: we should only release games that are of exceptional quality, games that the players love and games that have a shot at being remembered forever. Very importantly, at Supercell these types of decisions are always owned by the team who is behind the game. We feel that it is critical that the people who are responsible for the game also get to decide about its future.\"\n\nAlong the same lines of those in the studio deciding its future, Paananen also said that in the coming year, Supercell would be curbing its personnel growth significantly -- not through layoffs, but simply through slowing the rate it had been moving at, a rate that has seen the company increase to around 300 employees at last count.\n\n\"A major component of our mission - i.e. to be the best place for the best teams to develop games - involves keeping the company as small as possible,\" Paananen said. \"This is because we believe smaller size minimizes the amount of bureaucracy and processes while maximizing room for innovation. And, we all simply like to work in a smaller company! Anyway, last year some of our game developers actually got concerned that the company might be getting too big too fast as we grew to just over 300 in size. We had a big discussion about this and, as a result, decided to slow down our growth significantly until we feel confident that we can keep our culture intact despite the growth.\n\n\"For someone outside Supercell, the above might sound really odd, even very inward focused. But, we believe that without our unique culture, and the small-company feel that goes with it, we could not develop the best games for you. Balancing things is not always easy and, as you may guess, we have our internal struggles, too.\"\n\nIn the same letter, Paananen reported that Supercell had seen revenue of $1.56 billion in 2019 -- down slightly from last year's $1.6 billion and the third drop in three years. However, the drop makes sense given that Brawl Stars didn't quite reach the same level of success as 2016's Clash Royale (or, prior to that, Clash of Clans).\n\nThe company's profit before taxes was $577 million.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://thecourier.com/breaking-news/2019/09/10/meijer-no-open-carry-in-our-stores/", "authors": [], "title": "Meijer: No open carry in our stores", "text": "Meijer has asked that customers do not open carry firearms inside their stores.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our customers and team members is our top priority, so we respectfully request that our customers do not open carry firearms at Meijer,\u201d the grocery chain posted Monday on Twitter. \u201cWe\u2019ve made this decision because open carry can create an environment that makes our customers and team members feel unsafe.\u201d\n\nThe request followed similar announcements from Walmart, Kroger and Walgreens in the wake of a mass shooting at an El Paso, Texas, Walmart.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/sudan-military-attacks-hospital-expels-wounded-protesters-190604200747631.html", "authors": [], "title": "Sudan military 'attacks hospital, expels wounded protesters'", "text": "Crowds of wounded people continued to throng the corridors of Sudan's Royal Care Hospital on Tuesday, a day after a deadly crackdown on protesters outside the military headquarters in the capital, Khartoum.\n\nSome sat on the floor with their wounds bandaged, as others with gunshot wounds lay waiting for help from doctors who had been tending to the wounded round the clock for more than a day.\n\nOutside the hospital in central Khartoum, more than a dozen military trucks carrying armed soldiers lined the street. They were from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the same faction that launched the raid that killed more than 35 people on Monday.\n\nA medic, who identified himself as Nazar, said the soldiers had surrounded the hospital early on Tuesday morning. Shortly after noon, they ordered the hospital staff to evacuate all wounded protesters within an hour.\n\n\"One of their seniors came into the hospital and told the administration to evacuate the hospital of patients,\" Nazar said. The soldier \"said they don't want the patients here. Some have left, the only ones remaining are those inwards,\" he said.\n\nSources at the hospital told Al Jazeera the soldiers also arrested one of the doctors, identified as Waleed Abdullah, after shooting him in the leg. The doctor was part of the medical team at the weeks-long sit-in, which was cleared out at dawn on Monday. Witnesses at the raid said troops also shot and beat doctors and medics working at medical tents at the protest site.\n\n\"They used whips and sticks to beat the doctors,\" a medic who witnessed the attack said. Requesting anonymity for fear of reprisal, she said the beatings were so severe that some of the doctors and medics had to be taken to hospitals for treatment.\n\n\"One of our colleagues had his arm broken when the RSF beat him,\" she said.\n\n'It's either you or the nation'\n\nIn addition to the 35 people who were killed during the pre-dawn raid, more than 200 were wounded, according to a doctor's committee aligned to the protest movement. Many were still missing on Tuesday and feared dead, the group said.\n\nThe attack, which protest leaders described as a \"massacre\", came nearly two months after the Sudanese military toppled President Omar al-Bashir following months of protests against his nearly 30 years of rule. A 10-member Transitional Military Council (TMC) took power and promised elections within two years, but protesters continued their sit-in, demanding a civilian-led transition to democracy.\n\nSudanese protesters burn tyres and set up barricades on roads to army headquarters after a deadly crackdown on Monday [Mahmoud Hjaj/Anadolu]\n\nThe two sides began negotiations, but tensions mounted as talks stalled over the composition of a new transitional authority. Monday's violence, which drew global condemnation, did not come as a surprise to the protesters.\n\nHours before the attack, the Sudanese Professionals' Association (SPA), which has led the anti-government protests in Sudan, issued a statement urging more people to join the sit-in. It also called on medics to prepare for an emergency. Some who answered the call marched to the sit-in calling on protesters to prepare to die.\n\n\"It's either you or the nation. Prepare your Kafan\", they chanted, referring to the white sheet used in Muslim burial rites.\n\nProtesters said they had anticipated that a large number of people would deter such an attack, but those hopes were misplaced. Live videos of the raid, streamed online, showed soldiers using live ammunition as they advanced on the protesters.\n\nA demonstrator who used to guard the makeshift barricades leading to the sit-in said he saw large numbers of soldiers being bussed in before the attack.\n\n\"They first drove in with their military pick-ups and blocked the entrance to the headquarters of the air and naval forces,\" he told Al Jazeera on the condition of anonymity. \"Then other pick-ups with men dressed in police uniforms but were clearly RSF drove in.\"\n\nThe shooting started shortly after 5am local time. The witness said the soldiers opened fire on people in the reflective vests worn by protesters guarding the barricades. The troops beat protesters and forced them to dismantle barricades to allow the military trucks through, he added.\n\n'Unjustified and unlawful'\n\nThe ensuing attack was recorded by fleeing protesters.\n\n\"They're killing us!\" one protester was heard in a video as sounds of gunshots cackled in the background. \"People, those forces are killing us!\"\n\n190604104903001\n\nIn other videos, verified by Al Jazeera, protesters can be seen shouting for help while still others bleeding on the ground as they took their last breaths.\n\n\"The RSF were shooting at the protesters and so we ran for cover,\" said Fawaz, who gave only one name.\n\n\"Some of them jumped off their pickups and headed towards the sit-in area, shooting at people, and beating those who ran to escape them. We ran, helping one of those injured by a bullet.\"\n\nFawaz, who was also a guard at the barricades, said the soldiers shot at people who tried to help wounded protesters.\n\n\"When we tried to help our injured colleague jump over a wall with us, the RSF started shooting,\" he recalled. \"We couldn't help him jump the wall with us as we escaped because he sustained more bullet wounds. We don't know if he's alive or dead.\"\n\nThe TMC has denied attacking protesters, saying clashes erupted at the protest camp when security forces followed a number of \"unruly\" people who had fled from to the sit-in from a nearby area, known as \"Colombia\".\n\nThe deadly violence, however, has prompted calls for an international inquiry.\n\n\"The decision to unleash violence against peaceful protesters is absolutely unjustified and unlawful, and a slap in the face for those who have been pursuing dialogue to achieve a handover to civilian government,\" said Jehanne Henry, associate Africa Director at Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"UN member states should urgently establish an impartial, independent UN inquiry into these atrocities, and ensure that those responsible for killings, detentions, destruction, and looting are held accountable.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/science/spacex-starlink-satellites-abort-launch-broadband-internet-network", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "title": "SpaceX aborts rocket launch carrying 60 Starlink satellites due to engine failure", "text": "SpaceX aborted the launch of its Falcon 9 rocket Sunday morning, grounding a mission that planned to carry 60 Starlink Internet satellites into space for the company\u2019s growing broadband mega-constellation after finding a problem with the rocket\u2019s engine just before liftoff.\n\nThe rocket had completed its countdown to launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida when the team issued the order to abort liftoff.\n\nSPACEX LAUNCHES, PURPOSEFULLY DESTROYS ROCKET IN CRITICAL ASTRONAUT ESCAPE TEST\n\n\u201cWe had a condition regarding engine power that caused us to abort today\u2019s launch,\u201d supply chain supervisor Michael Andrews said. \u201cThere are a thousand ways for a launch to go wrong and only one way it could go right.\u201d\n\nAndrews said the vehicle \u201cappeared in good health\u201d and SpaceX would release details on the next launch opportunity at a later time.\n\nThe launch would have marked the sixth launch of Starlink satellites for Elon Musk\u2019s spaceflight company, which has already deployed more than 100 satellites into space.\n\nThe Starlink satellites, each weighing about 573 pounds (260 kg), will deliver \u201cthe world's most advanced broadband Internet system,\u201d according to SpaceX.\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket would have deployed the Starlink satellites 270 miles (440km) above Earth\u2019s surface, where the satellites would have then used their onboard ion thrusters to climb to their operational altitude of 341 miles (550 km), the company said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Falcon 9 rocket being used for the mission made four previous flights into space.

Their latest attempt at a live-action fantasy blockbuster is Dolittle starring Robert Downey Jr. as Dr. Dolittle. Although the trailers for the film seem harmless enough, viewers might be surprised to learn that the character of Dr. Dolittle has surprisingly racist origins.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. with Mickey Mouse | Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nWhy the Dolittle books are so controversial\n\nThe Encyclopedia Britannica says the Dolittle series began a century ago when British author Hugo Lofting published The Story of Dr. Dolittle in 1920. The book was a success. It lead to several more sequels published over the course of the next 28 years. The popular 1922 sequel The Voyages of Dr. Dolittle won a prestigious Newbery Medal. Cinema Blend reports Voyages served as the basis for the Robert Downey Jr. version of Dolittle.\n\nBeloved at the time, the books have become infamous in years since. In keeping with 1920s British attitudes, the content of these books is very racist towards black people. The portrayal of Prince Bumpo, a black prince, is particularly upsetting.\n\nAccording to Washingtonian, The Story of Dr. Dolittle includes a scene in which the prince expresses his desire to become white. The New York Times says Bumpo wanted to become white so that Sleeping Beauty, the beloved fairy tale princess, would be willing to marry him. Dr. Dolittle reluctantly agrees to help Bumpo change his skin color by bleaching his skin white.\n\nHow the Dolittle franchise has dealt with its past\n\nEddie Murphy as the doctor | 20th Century-Fox/Getty Images\n\nSuch a story is utterly abhorrent to modern sensibilities. Even the publishers of the Dolittle books are aware how they\u2019ve aged horribly in regard to racial issues. The New York Times reports a 1980s reissue of the books removed racial epithets, offensive illustrations of black characters, and the aforementioned skin bleaching scene. If you\u2019re familiar with the Dolittle books, there\u2019s a good chance you were exposed to these sanitized editions rather than the originals.\n\nHas the uncomfortable history of Dr. Dolittle dulled the character\u2019s popularity? No. AllMovie reports that, in a dramatic and subversive twist of fate, a black actor, Eddie Murphy, took on the role of the doctor in a 1998 film. Unlike earlier Dolittle stories, this movie was set in contemporary times, letting go of the racist baggage of the original series\u2019 Victorian setting.\n\nWhat will Disney and Robert Downey Jr. do with the story?\n\nA fireworks display at the Cinderella Castle at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Florida | Mark Ashman/Disney Parks via Getty Images\n\nNow we will soon see the latest iteration of the franchise, the Robert Downey Jr. film Dolittle. Unlike its predecessor starring Eddie Murphy, this film will be set in the Victorian era, reports Entertainment Weekly. This would lead to controversy in the unlikely event it stays true to the original Dolittle books.\n\nA culture\u2019s moral compass can change drastically over the course of one short century.

The first plan, to have an all-star concert with the likes of Jay-Z, Dead & Company, the Killers, and more in Watkins Glen, New York, some 115 miles northwest of the original 1969 concert\u2014was scuttled after the venue backed out. Then the plan was to have it in Vernon, New York, but organizers couldn't get a permit. Lang finally found a location that would work\u2014all the way in Maryland\u2014but artists started to pull out of the festival and he decided to scrap the event and the anniversary concerts altogether.\n\nLang tells the AP that if he could go back and do things differently he would have tried to get permits earlier and worked with a different financial partner than Dentsu Aegis Network's Amplifi Live, which in late April announced it took back about $18 million\u2014the remains of the $49 million it had put in\u2014from the anniversary event. Lang said Dentsu's decision \"really put a halt to our efforts to get a mass gathering permit because all of the government agencies stopped working when they announced that.\" Asked why he hadn't worked with a touring juggernaut like Live Nation, which puts on hundreds of festivals successfully, Lang said: \"We really wanted to keep it independent. That's part of the character of our brand and our position in the world.\" He's still hoping there will be a Woodstock 50 at some point. \"Maybe next year,\" he said.

He\u2019s definitely a big personality, which made him a bit of a polarizing figure in the Jets\u2019 fanbase. There wasn\u2019t any evidence of Adams creating locker room problems, though. His teammates voted him team MVP the last two seasons and captain this past year. Do I think the Seahawks overpaid? Yes, I don\u2019t believe any non-quarterback is really worth what they gave up. Do I think Seahawks fans will care in a few years? It depends on whether Adams maintains his level of play. If he regresses, the trade could live in infamy. But if he maintains his current trajectory, he\u2019s going to end up in a gold jacket in Canton. From what I\u2019ve watched of the Seahawks through the years, I see him as a perfect fit in the Kam Chancellor role in Pete Carroll\u2019s system. This is probably sacrilege to say to Seahawks fans, but Adams might even be better than Chancellor in the Chancellor role.\n\nI put that last sentence in bold just for the shock value of thinking we might have anyone who can potentially be better than Kam Chancellor. On the other hand, if Jamal Adams is indeed better than Kam in his prime, then opposing NFL offenses will be in absolute shambles.\n\nBy the way, our own John Fraley also provided a breakdown of what McDougald brings to a Jets defense that quietly finished 9th in DVOA last season, and you can read that (along with reaction from Jets fans) over at GGN.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Wed Jan 01 13:50:18 +0000 2020", "id": 1212370465236357120, "id_str": "1212370465236357120", "full_text": "Jamal Adams does it all\n(ranks among safeties)\n\ncoverage:\n- 2.9 YAC/reception (1st)\n- 4.5 yds/target (2nd)\n\npass rush:\n- 6.5 sacks (1st)\n- 23 pressures (1st)\n\nrun defense:\n- missed on just 3% (1/36) of tackle chances (2nd)\n- 7 tackles for loss (3rd)\n\nNothing he can't do", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 270], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": []}, "source": "<a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter Web App</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 871883746865274880, "id_str": "871883746865274880", "name": "Michael Nania", "screen_name": "Michael_Nania", "location": "Yonkers, NY \u27a1\ufe0f NC", "description": "NY Jets || Co-owner @JetsXFactor || Co-host @CYJpod || \u2708\ufe0f", "url": "https://t.co/CeyP2akk1N", "entities": {"url": {"urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/CeyP2akk1N", "expanded_url": "https://jetsxfactor.com/jet-x-membership/", "display_url": "jetsxfactor.com/jet-x-membersh\u2026", "indices": [0, 23]}]}, "description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 10666, "friends_count": 358, "listed_count": 173, "created_at": "Tue Jun 06 00:17:38 +0000 2017", "favourites_count": 38818, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": true, "verified": false, "statuses_count": 31466, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "000000", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_tile": false, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1269947934357012485/TuY41Sg__normal.jpg", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1269947934357012485/TuY41Sg__normal.jpg", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/871883746865274880/1585263148", "profile_link_color": "0D9004", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "000000", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "000000", "profile_text_color": "000000", "profile_use_background_image": false, "has_extended_profile": true, "default_profile": false, "default_profile_image": false, "following": null, "follow_request_sent": null, "notifications": null, "translator_type": "none"}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 113, "favorite_count": 652, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "lang": "en"}], "spans": [[101, 367]]}, {"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/top-business-stories-this-week-walmart-in-healthcare-softbank-fedex-2019-9", "authors": ["Matt Turner"], "title": "Walmart's push into healthcare, SoftBank's struggles, and why FedEx dumped Amazon", "text": "Hello!\n\nWalmart, America's biggest retailer, this week opened a health clinic that has primary care, dentistry, and counseling services.

Will Bill Belichick leave New England before it turns ugly? There\u2019s no shortage of meaty NFL plotlines in 2021The NFL\u2019s general attitude towards 2020 can be summed up succinctly: What pandemic?Whereas other leagues ground to a halt, considered voiding their seasons, entered into complex bubbles or faced existential crises, the NFL thundered along, with the kind of bravado that is afforded only to the biggest and baddest and most-watched on the block.Some precautions were taken. Preseason was out. Mask mandates were in. But the bottom line was this: No matter the lineup, no matter the ridiculousness of the spectacle, no matter the health consequences, football will be played. And, in general, it was a success. Covid has the potential to embarrass the league in Week 17, the final week of the season, and we still do not know the extent of the health consequences, but for the most part the league got its wish: The season will be completed on time. As the calendar flips from 2020 to 2021, here are some subplots to keep an eye on. Aaron Rodgers\u2019 futureAs of now, Rodgers likely has his name etched on the MVP trophy. Voters love a narrative, and the Rodgers Revenge Tour is a better narrative than \u2018isn\u2019t Patrick Mahomes droningly excellent?\u2019 It\u2019s the Michael Jordan syndrome. (Voters actually gave Karl Malone an MVP award during Jordan\u2019s prime. That\u2019s a real thing that happened.)But it\u2019s not that long ago that the Packers selected Jordan Love in the first round of the draft, that Rodgers\u2019 future was up in the air, that the team had obviously selected his replacement, that it was just a matter of when not if Rodgers would leave.Rodgers has been terrific this season. His game has evolved. The improvisational off-script, jazz artist is still there, but he\u2019s married that with the on-script rhythm that defined his early years as a starter. It\u2019s a deadly combination.The power to decide his future now sits with Rodgers. He\u2019s performing at an MVP level and could guide the Packers to another Super Bowl title. Green Bay will want to keep the 38-year-old around until he truly starts to decline. But will Rodgers take matters into his own hands this offseason? How upset was he really by the love selection? With possible quarterback openings in such hot spots as New England, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, could Rodgers look to push his way out of title town as the final act of this year\u2019s tour? A franchise saleThe NFL as a whole has done a decent job of inoculating itself from the financial losses that have hit the majority of sports leagues during the pandemic. Rather than push games or add weeks, the NFL stripped back its preseason and steam-rolled ahead whenever there was a sign of a health scare. We are playing football! Who\u2019s ready to play? Who\u2019s watching? We\u2019ll play them on Monday nights and Tuesday nights and Wednesday afternoons and Saturday mornings, the quality of the games or the health of the players be damned.That was a lucrative strategy for the league, as much as any league is making money in the Covid age. But the league is still made up of old-school owners who made the bulk of their money in an old-school manner. While several owners have stomached the financial hit to their sporting institution, plenty have taken significant losses in their non-sporting ventures.You only have to look over to the NBA to see how even the tech-savvy, self-dubbed \u2018smart\u2019 sport owners have been hit by the pandemic: Tilman Fertitta, the NBA\u2019s latest owner, who paid a record $2.2bn for the Houston Rockets franchise in 2017, makes his money in casinos and restaurants. His operation has been reduced to 4% during the pandemic and he has been forced to take his company public, as well as accepting an operating loan from the league.There are similar issues in the NFL\u2019s upper chamber. Some owners are feeling the financial costs much more than others, particularly those whose wealth is based on owning an NFL franchise. (The NFL remains the sports league with the most \u2018legacy\u2019 ownership families.)Nobody will be shedding a tear for the fattest of fat cats, but NFL franchises are notoriously hard to prize away from owners because they print money. The pandemic has changed that. The year 2021 could usher in a band of new owners as those current owners who\u2019ve been most severely impacted by the pandemic try to recover funds. Will there be any Cam Newton takers?Newton\u2019s one-year plan in New England was clear: Get himself to the smartest, most creative and consistent organization in the sport; show that he still had plenty of juice left, that he just needed a break; and then sign a mega-deal this coming offseason, be it re-upping with New England or elsewhere.But for as much as Bill Belichick has tried to sell the Patriots-Cam Newton experience to the media and fans this season as a success, it hasn\u2019t worked. The Patriots\u2019 offensive staff has been creative and mailable, working around Newton\u2019s idiosyncrasies and lack of accuracy. But all too often when Newton has dropped back and attempted to play with some kind of rhythm, it\u2019s looked like he\u2019s trying to throw a medicine ballNewton\u2019s health is the question here. He no longer has the same kind of zip on his fastball, and his throwing accuracy that was so-so even during the best of times has now completely fallen off a cliff.Perhaps the Patriots talk themselves into Newton for another season as a bridge to whatever the team\u2019s quarterback future looks like. Perhaps they tell themselves he looked OK prior to his Covid diagnosis. Perhaps Belichick believes Newton, even with his flaws, will be fine once the Patriots are able to bring back the chunks of their roster that missed this season due to COVID. But that seems unlikely. It seems like Newton, the great pioneer, the paradigm-shifter, is ultimately shot. And if Belichick isn\u2019t willing to indulge another season, will any other team? And if not, what does Newton do? Retire? Sit out another year and hope to heal? It\u2019s hard to imagine Newton doing the rounds as a one-year hired gun on a ready-to-tank, rebuilding team. Is this it for Bill Belichick?It doesn\u2019t feel like Belichick is slowing down. But, at some point, Belichick is going to walk away from the Patriots\u2019 job. Belichick tried rolling things back for one more push this season, band-aiding together a roster that was missing the core of its defense due to Covid defections and which lacked a quarterback given Tom Brady\u2019s move to Florida.Is Belichick, at his advanced age, post-Covid, ready and willing after a par year to start another rebuild? He has no quarterback, and the backbone of the roster that delivered the last Super Bowl is starting to creak \u2013 a majority have already or are expected to exit this offseason. Plus: Belichick\u2019s staff is expected to be picked apart again during the offseason, both on the coaching side and in the Patriots front office. Is it possible he opts to walk away before things get ugly? The Justin Fields surgeThe Jaguars have locked up the number one pick in the upcoming draft. The selection is expected to be Trevor Lawrence, Clemson\u2019s once-in-a-lifetime-type quarterback prospect. But as always in a draft cycle, expect there to be a run on Justin Fields, the Ohio State quarterback who would be the sure-fire top selection in a traditional year.And if former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer winds up as the head honcho in Jacksonville, look out. The chatter will increase. Leaks will flow. Trade offers will arrive.Lawrence should be the top pick, but there is a chance that Jacksonville switch spots with the Jets (for a significant haul). A JJ Watt tradeJJ Watt and the Houston Texans are synonymous with one another. But if Houston is looking to generate some kind of assets to be able to improve its roster this offseason, moving Watt is one of the only ways.The Texans have little to no draft capital and have one of the worst cap sheets in the league. They also have a jumbled roster that is the walking embodiment of the fractured front office that oversaw its construction over the past five seasons. Yet there, in the middle of it all, is Deshaun Watson, one of the most gifted quarterbacks in the league. Having a great quarterback fixes a lot. So for the Texans to leap back into contention, even with the roster holes and lack of flexibility in the market, could take as few as five to six smart moves. One way to open up some sort of flexibility, to increase the margin of error when trying to make such moves, would be to move on from Watt while he still holds value.It would be a difficult move financially and culturally, but it would also be a savvy one. And it would allow Watt to get a shot with a different organization, where he may get a shot over the next 24 months to advance beyond the divisional round. New TV dealsAs noted in the Guardian\u2019s 2021 bold predictions piece, the NFL\u2019s current round of TV rights deals are set to expire in 2022. As sports continue to be the sole place that networks can bank on to produce a large, live audience, and as the NFL continues to reign supreme as the biggest provider of live content (eight of 2020s 10 most-watched single telecasts were football games or post games) the bidding is expected to be intense and expensive.The league could look to re-up with its traditional broadcast partners. Or it could hand a more favorable deal to ESPN/Disney, with the possibility of Disney snagging itself a coveted Super Bowl and moving its broadcasts to ABC. Or it could offer larger packages to a streaming client, like Amazon Prime, in the hopes of getting ahead of the live sports streaming curve or to try to make up for some of the revenue the league and its owners lost in 2020.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.tmz.com/2020/12/30/lil-pump-boards-flight-still-defiant-about-face-masks-and-covid-19/", "authors": [], "title": "Lil Pump Boards Flight, Still Defiant About Face Masks and COVID-19", "text": "Play video content MEGA\n\nLil Pump still doesn't buy there's a pandemic and still refuses to wear a face mask -- but after JetBlue banned him, he's still flying commercial.

On Friday, UC San Francisco, which processed the samples, announced the results of 1,845 nasal and oral swab tests.

Bolinas leaders limited water hookups decades ago to keep the community small and tore down traffic signs that pointed the way to town.\n\nStill, high-tech entrepreneurs managed to purchase homes, and property values and rents skyrocketed.

Even though hospitals were short of the components needed for tests, the organizers improvised and used what was plentiful. They are planning to publish a blueprint for other communities that want to follow their example.\n\nHe and Cyrus Harmon, 49, who founded a pharmaceutical startup and moved to Bolinas 10 years ago, got the idea for community-wide testing after reading about the northern Italian town of Vo. It tested nearly all its 3,000 residents at the height of the coronavirus outbreak. The two men said they wanted to give something back to the town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMark Pincus, who founded online game maker Zynga and also owns a home in Bolinas, donated the first $100,000.\n\nVolunteers flocked to help. \u201cIt is not about tech executives doing this,\u201d Harmon said. \u201cIt is about the community coming together and doing it.\u201d\n\nEngestrom knows the optics of rich people being tested while poor people go without are disturbing, but he said most residents in Bolinas live modestly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe median household income is about $58,000 and the median age is 62.5. More than 16% of the residents, mostly 65 and older, live below the poverty line, according to census data.\n\n\u201cI am definitely an outsider because I am part of the problem,\u201d said Engestrom, who bought a home here in 2014 . \u201cWe are jacking up the housing prices by coming here from San Francisco. I feel that.\u201d\n\nHe and other organizers of the testing project, working with infectious disease experts at UC San Francisco, had to scavenge for supplies. The long swabs typically used for testing were unavailable, but shorter swabs that experts said would suffice were plentiful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor protective gear for testers, the organizers scoured hardware stores for painter suits, also approved by scientists. A call on social media for the face shields produced so many that Engestrom has a storage-room full that he can\u2019t give away. Volunteers went online to hire phlebotomists \u2014 certified testers \u2014 to take the samples, obtained gloves from restaurant suppliers and masks from friends who bought them from China.\n\nA volunteer team of Airbnb engineers built the platform residents used to schedule appointments for the tests, and a GoFundMe page brought in donations, most under $1,000. Eventually, about $360,000 was raised. The biggest payment went to UCSF, which subsidized the project.\n\nIn addition to sampling residents for the virus, the town also tested them for antibodies. UCSF has started a companion study to test residents of San Francisco\u2019s highly dense Mission District, where infections have spread.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Bolinas organizers purchased wedding tents for the testing and set them up in the parking lot of a town park. Tests were done over four days.\n\nAmong the few who declined was Bruce Dark, 67.

He\u2019s 7-for-11 with five extra-base hits, and he added five RBIs on Saturday, highlighting the Yankees\u2019 eighth win in a row over Boston, who have the worst record in the AL.\n\nIt was also the Yankees\u2019 fourth consecutive victory, but they were forced to deal with another blow to an offense that\u2019s already sent Aaron Judge (right calf) and Giancarlo Stanton (left hamstring) to the IL.\n\nFrazier, Mike Tauchman and others have made up for the absence of Judge and Stanton.

LeMahieu then grounded out to end the inning and stayed at second base for the top of the fifth, but was replaced by Tyler Wade to start the sixth.\n\nX-rays taken at the Stadium were negative, but LeMahieu also underwent a CT scan and MRI exam to determine the extent of the injury.\n\n\u201cDJ can\u2019t be replaced,\u2019\u2019 said James Paxton, who gave up three runs in five innings.\n\nGio Urshela provided an early 2-0 lead with an opposite-field shot off Nathan Eovaldi in the first.\n\nJames Paxton gave that lead back in the third, when he allowed a two-run single to J.D.

The average retirement benefit check, according to a recent report, was $1,420 per month, or about $17,000 annually. There's a decent chance you've earned an above-average income in your life, though, so you may well collect more than that.\n\nHere's some guidance to help you figure out just what you can expect from Social Security -- along with a quick glance at some estimates for someone earning an annual income of $100,000.\n\nSocial Security benefits for $100,000 earners\n\nThere's no single answer to the question of what someone earning $100,000 annually will collect from Social Security. That's because of several factors. For starters, has the person been earning $100,000 throughout his or her working life? Some people may have received very low compensation in their first 25 years of work, followed by a decade of high compensation. Everyone's work history is a little different.\n\nOne's age also makes a difference, because everyone has a \"full retirement age\" based on their birth year (it's 66 or 67 for most of us today). Also, whether you start collecting benefits early, on time, or late will affect the size of your monthly checks. Those starting early will get smaller checks (but many more of them), while those delaying will get bigger ones (but fewer of them). You can start collecting as early as age 62 and as late as age 70.\n\nStill, it is possible to get a rough idea of what you might expect. Here's a look at what someone earning $100,000 now might receive yearly, depending on their age and when they start collecting their benefits, based on an online calculator from the Consumer Financial Protection Board:\n\nBorn in Age Today Start Collecting Benefits at 62 Start Collecting Benefits at 67 Start Collecting Benefits at 70 1989 30 $23,124 $32,832 $40,716 1984 35 $23,040 $32,712 $40,560 1979 40 $22,776 $32,340 $40,104 1974 45 $22,404 $31,812 $39,444 1969 50 $21,924 $31,128 $38,604 1964 55 $21,336 $30,300 $37,572 1959 60 $20,916 $29,364 $36,816\n\nThe Social Security website has its own online calculator to help you estimate your monthly benefits.\n\nBut what will you get from Social Security?\n\nThe table above is instructive, but it probably doesn't tell you what you can expect to receive. For that, head over to the Social Security Administration (SSA) website, and set up a my Social Security account. Once you do so, any time you log in to your account, you can review the SSA's record of your past earnings and its estimates of your future benefits.\n\nAn account also allows you to request a replacement Social Security card (if you meet certain criteria), request a replacement Medicare card, start or change the direct depositing of your benefit payments, and get a replacement SSA-1099 or SSA-1042S form for tax purposes -- among other things.\n\nAn added benefit of setting up an account is that it can thwart identity thieves who have been setting up accounts in other people's names and attempting to collect money those people are entitled to.\n\nHow to get more Social Security income\n\nNo matter what income you're slated to receive in retirement, there's a good chance that you can get more. There are various ways to increase your Social Security benefits, such as delaying starting to collect your benefits. You can postpone until age 70, getting bigger checks for every year you wait. Working for a few more years can also help, especially if you're earning more these days than you used to.\n\nThe more you know about Social Security, the more you can get out of the program -- and given that few people are sitting on huge retirement savings, Social Security income is more essential than ever.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/boston-judge-declines-calls-to-drop-charges-against-dozens-of-straight-pride-parade-counterprotesters", "authors": [], "title": "Boston judge declines calls to drop charges against dozens of 'straight pride parade' counterprotesters", "text": "A Boston judge refused to drop charges against protesters of the \"straight pride parade\" who tussled with police.\n\nBoston Municipal Court Judge Richard J.

That report is expected to show a U.S. unemployment rate of 6.8% and a non-farm jobs rise of 50,000 in December, versus a rise of 245,000 in November.\n\nThe other key economic report today is the afternoon release of the minutes of the last meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC).\n\nThe U.S. dollar index is lower and hit another 2.5-year low in early U.S. trading. The other important outside market sees February Nymex crude oil futures prices higher, at a 10-month high, and trading around $50.30 a barrel. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note futures is currently around 1.02%, a 10-month high. For perspective, the German 10-year government bond (bund) sees its yield currently at -0.54%.\n\nU.S. economic data due for release Wednesday includes the weekly MBA mortgage applications survey, the ADP national employment report, manufacturers\u2019 shipments and inventories, the global services PMI, the weekly DOE liquid energy stocks report, and the FOMC minutes from the last meeting.\n\nTechnically, the February gold futures bulls have the firm overall near-term technical advantage amid a price uptrend in place on the daily bar chart. Bulls\u2019 next upside price objective is to produce a close in February futures above solid resistance at the November high of $1,973.30.

The layoffs were first reported by The New York Times \u2014 though Lyft denied that it was part of a broader corporate restructuring, as originally reported by the Times.\n\nThe layoffs will affect Lyft\u2019s marketing and enterprise sales departments, according to a spokesperson. The company is moving away from city-based marketing teams to more regionally focused ones, while the enterprise team is reprioritizing its most important markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve carefully evaluated the resources we need to achieve our 2020 business goals, and the restructuring of some of our teams reflects that,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe are still growing rapidly and plan to hire more than 1,000 new employees this year.\u201d\n\nLyft\u2019s recent earnings reports have spurred investor doubts\n\nLyft CEO and co-founder Logan Green recently said publicly that he expects the company to become profitable on an adjusted earnings basis at the end of 2021, a year ahead of its original projection. But Lyft\u2019s recent earnings reports have spurred investor doubts about the company\u2019s near-term future.\n\nLyft said it lost $463.5 million in the third quarter of 2019, which was almost twice the amount that the company lost over the same period of time last year. The ride-hailing company brought in nearly a billion dollars in revenue \u2014 $955.6 million to be exact \u2014 which, compared to $585 million of revenue in the third quarter of 2018, represents an increase of 63 percent year over year. The previous quarter, Lyft reported losing $644 million, or $197 million after adjusting for so-called EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization).\n\nUber and Lyft, which both went public this year, have set records for the amount of money lost in the run-up to their respective IPOs. And since going public, both companies have continued to disappoint institutional and retail investors. Uber had to lay off around 1,000 workers last year amid its own restructuring efforts.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/3/20946096/jorge-masvidal-knows-conor-mcgregor-doesnt-really-want-to-fight-him-ill-f-ck-that-little-guy-up", "authors": ["Damon Martin", "Nov"], "title": "Jorge Masvidal knows Conor McGregor doesn\u2019t really want to fight him: \u2018I\u2019ll f*ck that little guy up\u2019", "text": "Jorge Masvidal is a man with a lot of options following his third-round TKO of Nate Diaz in the UFC 244 main event. But one name he doesn\u2019t expect to see on the other end of a contract is former two-division champion Conor McGregor.\n\nWhile Masvidal called for a fight against McGregor earlier this year, it appears he\u2019s moved past any previous interest. McGregor had also mentioned the possibility, stating he\u2019d like to face the UFC 244 winner if he\u2019s successful in his planned return in January.\n\nAfter dispatching Diaz, Darren Till and Ben Askren\u2014all by knockout or TKO\u2014this year, Masvidal doesn\u2019t believe McGregor wants anything to do with him.\n\n\u201cSome of you motherf*ckers are mean because you know what the f*ck I\u2019ll do to that little dude,\u201d Masvidal said at Saturday\u2019s post-fight press conference when asked about McGregor. \u201cI\u2019ll f*ck that little guy up. He\u2019s a f*cking midget. Dana White, president of this motherf*cking company said I\u2019m too much man for him. I get it why people want to see him hurt for the stunts he\u2019s been pulling, but he don\u2019t want this sh*t.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just talking so he can get his name out there. He was cheering for Nate. He wanted to run it back with Nate.\u201d\n\nUFC president Dana White previously shot down the fight, adding that Masvidal would be too big for McGregor and that the Irish superstar should focus on his own division.\n\nMcGregor hasn\u2019t fought since October 2018, when he suffered a fourth-round submission loss to reigning UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov.\n\nAfter announcing his intention to return on Jan. 18, McGregor has loosely been attached to a potential fight against Donald \u201cCowboy\u201d Cerrone. But that matchup is still far from official, per White.\n\nEven if McGregor returns with a win, Masvidal doesn\u2019t see a need to set foot in the Octagon with the Irish star. At this point, he just views the fight as nothing more than a mismatch.\n\n\u201cThat dude ain\u2019t retarded,\u201d Masvidal said while referencing McGregor\u2019s recent court case after he assaulted a 50-year-old bar patron. \u201cYou see he punches old people in the face cause those are fights that he could win.\n\n\u201cHe don\u2019t want this sh*t. You know he doesn\u2019t want this sh*t.

Sign up here!\n\n(Kitco News) - Gold and silver prices are slightly lower in the early U.S. trading Tuesday, as the bulls need to see prices stabilize in order to avoid serious chart damage, following Monday\u2019s drubbing. October gold futures were last down $2.10 at $1,900.00 and December Comex silver was last down $0.132 at $24.26 an ounce.\n\nMonday\u2019s mostly downside price action in raw commodity futures markets, led by the huge declines in gold and silver, rattled heretofore confident commodity bulls. If the raw commodity markets can show price stability the rest of this week, following Monday\u2019s drubbing, most will escape with their near-term price uptrends still in place and with no technical damage. However, more solid downside price pressure this week would end most commodity markets\u2019 near-term price uptrends. Thus, trading action the rest of this week will be extra important for many raw commodity markets, including the metals.\n\nGlobal stock markets were mixed overnight, with Asian shares mostly down and European shares mixed to firmer. U.S. stock indexes are set to open the New York day session mixed. Risk aversion is keener early this week as Covid-19 infections are on the rise in Europe and in parts of the U.S., prompting new worries about businesses locking down again. The death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader-Ginsburg has shifted focus away from Congress providing a new stimulus package for U.S. citizens and businesses. U.S.-China trade and political tensions continue to run hot. And many in the marketplace believe the U.S. presidential election results will be disputed and protracted. All of the above may well keep stock market traders in a dour buying mood right in the middle of a time of year that history shows stock markets can get very wobbly.\n\nFed Chairman Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Mnuchin will testify to a House financial services committee Tuesday morning. Powell is expected to say the Congress needs to do more to keep the U.S. economy afloat.\n\nThe important outside markets today see the U.S. dollar index slightly higher following solid gains Monday that pushed the USDX to a six-week high. Nymex crude oil prices are firmer and trading around $40.00. Meantime, the yield on the U.S. Treasury 10-year note is trading around 0.67% today.\n\nU.S. economic data due for release Tuesday includes the weekly Johnson Redbook and Goldman Sachs retail sales reports, the Richmond Fed business survey, and existing home sales. Several Federal Reserve officials are slated to give speeches today.\n\nTechnically, the gold bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but are fading and need to show fresh power to keep the near-term price uptrend alive. Bulls\u2019 next upside price objective is to produce a close in October futures above solid resistance at this week\u2019s high of $1,954.10. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at the August low of $1,865.00\u2014which would negate the near-term price upternd. First resistance is seen at the overnight high of $1,916.80 and then at $1,930.00. First support is seen at the overnight low of $1,890.70 and then at $1,875.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.5\n\nDecember silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage but have faded and need to stabilize prices this week, to avoid more serious technical damage being inflicted. The near-term price uptrend on the daily bar chart has been at least temporarily negated. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at this week\u2019s high of $27.13 an ounce. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $22.50. First resistance is seen at $25.00 and then at the overnight high of $25.30. Next support is seen at this week\u2019s low of $23.78 and then at $23.50.

We got dropped for a couple days in a row, so I was proud that we got back on our feet, stood firmly in the middle of ring,\u201d he said in a Zoom call with media after the game.\n\nAfter the Padres led most of the game 1-0, the D-backs finally plated two runs in the top of the eighth. San Diego quickly tied it up in the bottom half of the inning.\n\nArizona managed to continue its offensive production in the ninth that had not been there for the first 25 innings of the season.\n\nLeft fielder David Peralta said that the team was more patient in those final couple innings and had worked out some of the funk that comes with the first at-bats of the season.\n\n\u201cYou always want to get the first hit, and you want to do the job and sometimes you put pressure a little bit on yourself, but as soon as you get the first hit, you go, \u2018OK, there we go,'\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s normal, and we just have to control ourselves and control what we can do.\u201d\n\nWith one out in the top ninth, Ildemaro Vargas singled and Kevin Cron and Nick Ahmed both walked against Kirby Yates, who only had 30 walks in the last two seasons combined.\n\nThat brought up the top of the order and leadoff man Ketel Marte.\n\nMarte hit a fly ball just deep enough for Vargas to tag up and score the go-ahead run, and then Peralta got a base hit up the middle to drive home another.\n\nJust like that, the D-backs took a two-run lead.\n\nIn the bottom of the ninth, Peralta made another impact play. Tommy Pham drilled a pitch to left with one on and one out, but Peralta made a leaping grab on the run to get the out.\n\nThe Catch of the Year belongs to @DPFreightTrain6. https://t.co/HGmFo7tNmv\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why he\u2019s got gold on his mitt. It\u2019s not always about how, it\u2019s about how many, and that\u2019s No. 1 for us,\u201d said Archie Bradley, who was in as closer for the first time this year.\n\nThat catch likely ended up saving the game.\n\nThe next Padres batter hit an RBI double, but Bradley retired the next batter to get the five-out close and send the D-backs away with their first win of the season.\n\nFollow

Saturday\u2019s unrest drew hordes of demonstrators to downtown Salt Lake City and spurred innumerable staredowns and physical clashes between police and protesters, two altercations grabbed much of the attention Sunday.\n\nThe first: A man who drove his vehicle into the crowd and pulled out a bow and arrow, which he allegedly aimed at protesters.\n\nThe second: A police officer, decked out in riot gear, who knocked over an elderly man with a cane while he was standing on a sidewalk by the Main Library.\n\nBoth were captured on video.\n\nThe Salt Lake City Police Department is investigating both confrontations.\n\nWhen officers saw the man with the bow being assaulted, Chief Mike Brown said in a video message Sunday afternoon, their first thought was for his safety. So they pulled him out of the crowd, offered aid and ascertained his identity.\n\nProtesters flipped over the man\u2019s car, which caught on fire and burned.\n\nIn a posted video, the man, identified as Brandon McCormick, responded to a stranger who asked him if he calls himself an American with: \u201cYes, I\u2019m American. All lives matter.\u201d Immediately afterward, he lifted his hunting bow and aimed an arrow at those around him.\n\nLater, McCormick found himself giving a television interview with FOX 13. In it, he said he was there to protect police with the weapons he had and described how he was targeted for saying \u201call lives matter\u201d and beaten through his open window.\n\nMcCormick, whose Facebook page says he lives in Salt Lake City but is originally from Barstow, Calif., has shared his views before on Facebook, posting racist memes and even talking about wanting to go back in time to \u201ctake out\u201d former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when they were \u201cin the crib.\u201d\n\nScreenshot of Facebook post by Brandon McCormick.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nIn a May 21 post, McCormick shared with his followers that \"if you didn\u2019t grow up during the cold war and or you and or your anaesters [ancestors] are here ileagely [illegally].

Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said the man would be charged.\n\nBREAKING: Video out of Salt Lake City shows a man readying to aim a bow &  arrow at demonstrators as he yells \u201call lives matter\u201d - demonstrators jumped him and then set his car on fire. Police responded. https://t.co/ErGUuygkVs\n\nIn Sunday afternoon\u2019s update, Brown also addressed the episode in which the elderly man was knocked down. After examining video footage, Brown said the officer has been identified.\n\n\u201cI have seen the video,\" the chief said, \u201cand it was inappropriate.\u201d\n\nBrown did not name the officer nor state whether the officer had been suspended.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not OK,\u201d the mayor told The Salt Lake Tribune of the incident. \u201cIt seems to be well outside the protocol, and it\u2019s being investigated.\u201d\n\nWe are aware of this situation and will deal with it. https://t.co/MOqNUyCgIM\n\nBrown said the department will follow its procedures, which includes an investigation by internal affairs, as well as a review by the Civilian Review Board. A recommendation then will be made upon completion.\n\n\u201cI want to say this is not what I would expect from Salt Lake City PD,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMy expectations are, that if people are exercising their First Amendment rights, we give them the space to do so peacefully. I have spoken to this gentleman to express my concern for his well-being and to apologize to him personally.

A new study suggests that the number of people using marijuana is increasing faster for those aged over 65 than for any other age group, but they come up against many barriers when trying to access it.\n\n\"Older Americans are using cannabis for a lot of different reasons,\" said Hillary Lum, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and coauthor of the study. \"Some use it to manage pain while others use it for depression or anxiety.\"\n\nBut the study, published this month in the journal Drugs & Aging, found that a lack of research, unclear communication with doctors, and a reluctance to be honest about its use due to stigma, are all stopping older people getting the products they need.\n\nResearchers interviewed 136 people over the age of 60 in 17 focus groups across 13 counties in Colorado, and found that older people don't always feel comfortable asking for a medical marijuana license from their doctors. This pushes them towards buying from the black market instead.\n\n\"I think [doctors can] be a lot more open to learning about it and discussing it with their patients,\" said one respondent. \"Because at this point I have told my primary care I was using it on my shoulder. And that was the end of the conversation. He didn't want to know why, he didn't want to know about effects, didn't want to know about side effects, didn't want to know anything.\"\n\nOther respondents said their doctors refused provide them with the certificate required for obtaining medical marijuana, and they suspected it was because they weren't educated on the latest research.\n\nCannabis products can be an important alternative treatment for many older people, who are often taking many different types of medications that can have unpleasant and harmful side effects.\n\n\"From a physician's standpoint this study shows the need to talk to patients in a non-judgmental way about cannabis,\" said Lum. \"Doctors should also educate themselves about the risks and benefits of cannabis and be able to communicate that effectively to patients.\"\n\nRead more: People use cannabis products for health problems like Parkinson's, epilepsy, and acne \u2014 but misinformation and out-of-date regulations are stopping most from benefiting\n\nBarbara Buck, a realtor in her 50s, started growing cannabis when it became legal for medical use in her state. She told INSIDER she's an \"avid gardener,\" so thought she might as well give it a try.\n\nBuck said she used cannabis herself to help with sleep and menopause symptoms, but has also converted many people in their 60s and 70s towards cannabis for pain, depression, and anxiety.\n\n\"The main reason I grew Cannabis [is] to help people like it has always helped me,\" she said. \"The only reason I stopped was due to moving to a house that wasn't as suitable for growing. My goal is to move to the country in a couple of years and start again!\"\n\nShe said she's noticed the taboo surrounding cannabis has shifted immensely in the last decade, but she still is hesitant to be open with everyone about the fact that she uses it herself. Nevertheless, she thinks marijuana should be legal worldwide, because you can't overdose on it like opioids or alcohol \u2014 addictions that millions of Americans suffer with.\n\nThis was mirrored in the results of the new study. Participants thought more negatively towards recreational cannabis than medical cannabis, but they also felt more favorably towards it than alcohol.\n\nOne concern Buck has, though, is about over-regulation from the government.\n\n\"I believe it will go federally legal very soon in the US in part due to the last Farm Bill that was passed,\" she said. \"Now that the government sees how much money there is to be made they will do whatever it takes to get a piece of the pie.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/16/australia/australia-election-morrison-shorten-intl/index.html", "authors": ["Analysis Ben Westcott"], "title": "Australians aren't really happy with either of their choices for leader, but they have to vote anyway", "text": "(CNN) Arrogant.

Polls taken shortly before the vote showed a tight race with a slight advantage to the center-left Labor Party.\n\nNeither of the two competitors for Australia's next prime minister has a high international profile -- even the incumbent Morrison has only been in the job eight months.\n\nMorrison is a former Tourism Australia chief executive and committed Pentecostal Christian who quickly gained a reputation across Australia as immigration minister in 2013 and 2014.\n\nHe claimed credit for stopping the refugee boats coming to Australia and effectively implementing the country's notorious offshore detention centers, which human rights groups have described as \"open-air prisons.\"\n\nLabor Leader Bill Shorten and Labor Candidate for Boothby Nadia Clancy hand out sausages in Adelaide on May 14.\n\nHis opponent, Bill Shorten, has been the Labor leader for almost six years. Shorten rose to power through the union movement, during which time he headed up the Australian Worker's Union, one of the country's largest.\n\nBut Shorten also brings baggage with him to the Saturday vote. As a powerful powerbroker in Labor's center-right faction, Shorten was seen as one of the masterminds behind the toppling of Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2010, an event which preceded nine years of leadership chaos across both parties. It earned him a reputation as \"untrustworthy.\"\n\nAustralians haven't always distrusted their politicians. Former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke, who died on Thursday at the age of 89, was hugely popular during most of his time in power.\n\nJohn Warhurst, emeritus professor of politics at the Australian National University, told CNN there was just a general lack of enthusiasm for these two current options.\n\n\"None of them have that indefinable popularity that someone like (former leaders) Malcolm Turnbull or Bob Hawke had, they don't naturally make a very positive connection with the Australian community,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison and Labor leader Bill Shorten shake hands at the start of \"The Leaders' Debate'' on May 8 in Canberra.\n\nLeadership chaos\n\nIf Shorten wins to become Australia's new prime minister, he would be the sixth leader in just over a decade.\n\nThe rapid changeover of prime ministers in party leadership contests has become a national and international joke, with some comparing Australia to other dysfunctional democracies like Italy and Greece.\n\nTony Abbott promised to end the leadership turmoil after he won the 2013 election. But less than two years later he was kicked out by his own party for Turnbull.\n\nTurnbull narrowly won the 2016 national election against Shorten, only to be on the receiving end of the knife in August 2018, replaced with Morrison.\n\nFormer Liberal Party leader Hewson said the constant changes had not only eroded voter trust in politicians, but also pulled national attention away from issues important to Australia's future.\n\n\"All the big issues have been left adrift, whether its housing affordability, or electricity prices, there's been a whole lot of areas which probably need great structural reform,\" he said.\n\nRecord-high voter dissatisfaction\n\nIn a survey after the 2016 election, the Australian National University found the country's dissatisfaction with democracy was at an all-time high.\n\nOf almost 3,000 voters interviewed, 40% said they were unhappy with Australia's democracy, 56% said the government was run for a few big interests and a record 74% said people in government just \"look after themselves.\"\n\nAs more and more Australians grow dissatisfied, voters have been turning to minor parties in record numbers.\n\nAt the last election in 2016, more Australians cast ballots for a third-party candidate than at any time since the end of World War II. In the country's upper house, the Senate, one in three votes was for neither the Labor party or the Liberal National coalition.\n\nAnd recent polls suggest minor parties are unlikely to go away in the 2019 vote.\n\n\"They're providing some relief valves for people who want to go anywhere but the major parties,\" Warhurst said.\n\nElection you may not want to win\n\nShould Shorten win on Saturday, he will face a difficult battle to get his ambitious agenda through parliament. The Labor Party wants to take action on climate change, increase taxes on the wealthy and boost funding to schools and hospitals.\n\nMorrison has pledged to keep the economy strong, slash debt and reduce taxes across the board.\n\nBut Hewson said neither side had addressed an important reality during campaigning -- Australia's slowing economy.\n\n\"The headwinds of our economy are very significant, there's a lot of complacency and ... you haven't had a recession in over 20 years,\" he said. \"(But) you can't rule it out in the next 12 to 18 months.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks/wall-st-rallies-on-stimulus-cheer-trade-optimism-idUSKCN1V911H?il=0", "authors": ["April Joyner", "Min Read"], "title": "Wall Street rallies on hopes of global economic stimulus", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks climbed on Monday as reports of stimulus efforts in China and Germany calmed fears of a severe downturn in the global economy that were stoked last week as bond yields fell.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 has recovered most of its losses following Wednesday\u2019s brief inversion of the yield curve between 2-year and 10-year Treasuries, commonly viewed as an indicator of a recession within the next two years.

The Canadian marijuana stock plunged more than 56%, much worse than most of its top rivals.\n\nBut at least one analyst thinks that Aurora could potentially have a \"fantastic 2020.\" Pablo Zuanic with Cantor Fitzgerald even projects a one-year price target for Aurora that's double the stock's current level. Here's why Zuanic believes this beaten-down pot stock could see better days ahead.\n\nTwo ingredients for Aurora's success\n\nZuanic suggests that Aurora could do two things that would cause the stock to skyrocket.\n\nFirst, he'd like for Nelson Peltz to take a more active role. Aurora brought the billionaire strategic advisor on board last year to help line up partners from outside the cannabis industry. In particular, Zuanic thinks that Peltz, a well-known activist investor, should push for Aurora to exercise more financial discipline. He also wants Peltz to find a consumer packaged goods (CPG) company that would buy a significant stake in Aurora.\n\nSecond, Zuanic wants Aurora to hire a new CEO along the lines of Canopy Growth's (NYSE:CGC) incoming CEO, David Klein. Investors reacted positively to Canopy's hiring of Klein, who has served as Constellation Brands' (NYSE:STZ) CFO and as chair of Canopy Growth's board of directors.\n\nShould Aurora check off both of these boxes, Zuanic believes that its stock would at least double. However, he doesn't think everything is sunshine and roses for the company. Despite his general optimism about Aurora, Zuanic cut his one-year price target for the stock by nearly 15% after lowering sales projections for the cannabis producer.\n\nThe rest of the story\n\nThere are several things that investors need to consider with Cantor Fitzgerald's positive outlook for Aurora. Zuanic has stood out as one of the stock's biggest bulls for a while now. He has expressed more optimistic views about the stock than nearly any other analyst in the past.\n\nWhile Zuanic wants Peltz to line up a major equity investor from the CPG industry, that's exactly the opposite of what Peltz has advocated in the past. In May 2019, Cam Battley, then Aurora's chief corporate officer, said that Peltz recommended that Aurora avoid a path where it could be gobbled up by a larger company.\n\nHowever, it's possible that Peltz could change his tune after Aurora's meltdown in 2019. As part of his consulting deal, Peltz received options to buy nearly 20 million shares, with these options vesting on a quarterly basis beginning last year and going through the next three years. Peltz has ample motivation to push for Aurora to take steps that would boost its stock price. A major investment from a big CPG company would almost certainly do just that.\n\nOn the other hand, getting a large CPG company to invest lots of money in a cannabis producer is easier said than done. Constellation Brands has lost a boatload of money from its investment in Canopy Growth so far. Other CPG companies could look at Constellation's experience and be reluctant to put much skin in the game at this point.\n\nSpurring Aurora to hire a new CEO could be an easier task. The departure of Cam Battley could be a hint that the company is looking to potentially make a change. In recent months, Battley was more involved with conference calls with analysts than CEO Terry Booth was.\n\nBut it doesn't seem necessary for Aurora to bring in a new CEO to exercise more fiscal discipline. The company already announced that it's suspending construction at its Aurora Nordic 2 and Aurora Sun facilities, moves that will reduce capital spending by around $190 million in Canadian dollars.\n\nWill Aurora stock double?\n\nMy view is that Aurora Cannabis' shares could double as Zuanic predicts if the company finds a major equity partner and hires a new CEO. I'm skeptical, though, that Aurora will actually achieve the former goal.

All except for one, basically.\n\nThe tech giant reported a better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter Thursday, and the forecast for the coming year suggested continuing strength. Microsoft MSFT, +0.11% beat on earnings, even excluding a tax benefit of $2.6 billion, or 34 cents a share, for transferring some of its intangible properties to Ireland, and shares added 2.7% to its market-leading $1.045 trillion market cap in the extended session.\n\nMicrosoft was led by stellar results in the Azure cloud computing, LinkedIn and cloud-software segments, with only one laggard: The Xbox gaming business and its related services. Revenue in the gaming business fell 10%, as the company lapped last year\u2019s \u201cFortnite\u201d-fueled services gains and hardware sales plunged 48%.\n\nThose issues are expected to continue, at least until Microsoft releases its next Xbox console that was teased for the first time at the E3 conference earlier this year as \u201cProject Scarlett.\u201d That release won\u2019t happen this fiscal year, however, and Microsoft said that it expects revenue in gaming to be down slightly again this fiscal year, with double-digit growth in software and services offset by declining console sales.\n\nFor more: Why Microsoft is suddenly the most valuable company in Big Tech\n\nThat was the only bad news out of Thursday\u2019s report, though, as the Azure cloud business continued to steal the show for Microsoft. The so-called intelligent cloud segment had the biggest revenue total out of Microsoft\u2019s three baskets of businesses for the first time last quarter, growing sales 19% to $11.4 billion. Azure was up 64%, and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said the cloud business \u201cwas again the star of the show.\u201d\n\nThe business has continuing momentum, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said, noting that Microsoft has contracted but not recognized revenue of $91 billion, about half of which it expects to recognize in the next 12 months. Company executives also touted recent deals of more than $10 million, including a big cloud computing contract with AT&T T, -0.51% . One analyst asked if some press reports were accurate that the AT&T deal was valued at more than $2 billion.\n\n\u201cIt is a very significant deal, I\u2019m not going to comment on any specific dollar terms,\u201d Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said in the company\u2019s conference call. \u201cIt is the largest commercial deal that we have signed of the size and we see we have line of sight onto many more such deals.\u201d\n\nProductivity and business processes software came in at $11 billion, up 14%, with strong growth in its Office products and a surprise beat by its LinkedIn business, which grew to almost $1.9 billion of quarterly revenue and is proving to be one of Microsoft\u2019s savviest acquisitions in recent years. Revenue at the job-seekers social network jumped 25%, better than consensus of 24% growth, said Michael Turits, a Raymond James analyst.\n\nEarnings wrap: Microsoft earnings jump nearly 50% and more growth is in the forecast\n\nThe PC business was just behind cloud with a total of $11.3 billion in revenue, though growth of 4% was dragged down by the gaming business. The transition to Windows 10, which Microsoft says is a more secure operating system, was a big driver and will continue to be for the next few quarters as Microsoft ends support for Windows 7 at the end of the year. The Surface tablet even had strong growth of 14%.\n\n\u201cThere is, I think, a recognized momentum with Windows 10 in its deployment inside of enterprises for its security and management value proposition,\" Hood said.\n\nNadella has unequivocally proved that his strategy to focus Microsoft on cloud computing was a correct one with two straight strong fiscal years that have made Microsoft a trillion-dollar company.

But there's still plenty of speculation surrounding a Series 6 smartwatch to hold us over in the meantime. We've compiled a roundup of plausible and compelling new features for the Apple Watch Series 6 based on the latest leaks, rumors and Apple patents.\n\nDesign: A round Apple Watch, but not this year\n\nSave for a few minor changes such as larger screens, different materials and various watch band designs, the look of the watch hasn't changed much since Apple introduced the first Apple Watch in 2014. And this year will be no different.\n\nRumors of a circular watch face on the Apple Watch have been making the rounds for a few years now. Some of its Android counterparts like the Samsung Galaxy Watch have circular designs, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to think Apple would follow suit. To add fuel to the fire, the company has also issued a couple Apple Watch patents that show a round display. But so far, it's just a possibility; the existence of a patent doesn't guarantee Apple will use it in a product. Even if one of these patents does become a reality, it would likely take years. A change this big would require Apple to rework the hardware and software of the watch, and so far we haven't heard anything that would indicate it's happening in 2020.\n\nNew watch face options, but no store\n\nThe Apple Watch has tons of customizable watch faces (known as \"complications\") ranging from animated Disney characters to weather-centric interfaces. But Apple still hasn't loosened the reins for third-party watch faces, and we don't see that changing anytime soon.\n\nInstead Apple might allow users to share watch faces. According to a 9to5Mac, each watch face configuration will be shared as a unique file via AirDrop. The report, which cites leaked iOS 14 code as the source of its information, also says WatchOS 7, the next version of Apple's smartwatch software, will add an analog-style tachymeter to its design options that would measure speed and distance.\n\nYou may also be able to use shared albums from your photos app to create a customized watch face that cycles through the photos in that album. That means family members could add individual photos to the shared album for everyone in the group to see on their wrists.\n\nLastly, for patriotic users, WatchOS 7 may add an \"international\" option that lets you choose a country's flag as your watch face.\n\nA new fitness app\n\nFitness has been at the core of the Apple Watch since its launch, and this year Apple may take it even further. According to MacRumors, the company is working on a standalone fitness app. Unlike the existing Activity app that tracks your progress and is already on the Apple Watch (and iPhone), this one would give you guided workouts for an assortment of different activities such as running, cycling, rowing, strength training, dance and yoga.\n\nThere's no shortage of third-party fitness apps like this for the Apple Watch, but a native fitness app could put a lot of those out of business. The app would be available on the iPhone and Apple TV as well as the Apple Watch. And it might be free. The MacRumors report says there's no evidence of in-app purchases, but that doesn't necessarily rule out a subscription based approach like Apple Music.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Apple Watch Series 6: What to expect\n\nNative sleep tracking may finally arrive\n\nThis could finally be the year when Apple Watch gets native sleep tracking. Since acquiring the sleep sensor Beddit back in 2017, a tracker that sits under the mattress, there have been rumors about Apple integrating a similar feature in the Apple Watch. A \"Sleep app\" was also accidentally mentioned in a screenshot of Apple's preinstalled Alarm app in the App Store. The image was spotted by a reader of MacRumors back in October, and has since been removed. An April 30 leak on Twitter seems to corroborate this rumor.\n\nCurrently, sleep tracking is available on the Apple Watch through third-party apps and one of the biggest hurdles for Apple to offer it natively has been battery life. The current Apple Watch models last about a day and a half of normal use, but a feature like this would require overnight monitoring. This would likely drain the battery much faster. It's in the company's best interest to solve this issue soon though; many Apple Watch competitors like Fitbit and Samsung have had it on their devices for years.\n\nPulse oximeter to measure blood oxygen levels\n\nEven if the Series 6 doesn't have native sleep tracking, Apple will likely continue expanding health and wellness features for the next Apple Watch.\n\nThis year's big health feature could be what's known as SPO2 tracking. This would allow the watch to measure your blood oxygen levels, like a pulse oximeter, and alert you if it dips below a certain threshold, according to 9to5Mac. This is good timing, because some doctors are recommending pulse oximeter devices to monitor COVID-19 symptoms, and people have begun purchasing pulse oximeters during the coronavirus pandemic. The April 30 leak corroborates this rumor as well.\n\nThe Apple Watch already does something similar with heart rate, and alerts you if it detects an abnormally high, low or irregular heart rhythm indicative of atrial fibrillation (afib).\n\nFor this to be possible, the Series 6 could require a new type of sensor, likely a pulse oximeter. Or it might be able to pull with a software update and use the existing hardware. The Apple Watch already tracks VO2 max (or maximum oxygen consumption) inside the Activity app using the GPS and heart rate sensor during exercise.\n\nOther health rumors include glucose and blood-pressure monitoring on the next Apple Watch, but these could be further off.\n\nA kid-friendly Apple Watch\n\nThe leaked iOS 14 code reportedly also references new tools for parents. Rather than give their kids an iPhone, parents looking to stay connected with their kids, could set up a second Apple Watch (completely separate from theirs) using their iPhone and Apple ID as the host. This would also give parents the final say on what kind of content their kids can access on the watch like emergency contacts and music.\n\nWith a feature called SchoolTime in WatchOS 7, parents could even determine what apps can be used at what times to limit distractions in the classroom.\n\nThis would also mean adapting some of the health features for younger users. According to 9 to 5 Mac, the ring system (used for activity tracking) would be based on different metrics. The red move ring, for example, would track active minutes instead of active calories as it does with adults. The Watch will also incentivize kids to keep moving by offering virtual rewards when they take part in sports or outdoor activities.\n\nTracking panic attacks and stress\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 6 will also reportedly come with several mental health monitoring features, including the ability to detect when the wearer is about to experience a panic attack (another timely feature, if it pans out, during the global pandemic). This rumor was also mentioned in the April 30 leak, which referenced \"Mental Health Abnormalities Detection.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/tiger-king-podcast-host-wants-margot-robbie-play-joe-exotic", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "title": "'Tiger King' podcast host wants Margot Robbie to play Joe Exotic", "text": "Margot Robbie's next gig could be a unique one if the \"Tiger King\" podcast host gets his way.\n\nAs the success of Netflix's \"Tiger King\" continues, a miniseries -- which was reportedly ordered back in November by Universal Content Productions and based on the podcast \"Joe Exotic: Tiger King\" hosted by Robert Moor -- is getting its casting together to tell the tale of rival big cat enthusiasts.\n\nOn an episode of Andy Cohen's SiriusXM show on Monday, Moor opened up about his ideas on casting, including the role of Joe Exotic, an eccentric zookeeper from the South.\n\n'TIGER KING' EARNS REACTIONS FROM CELEBRITIES LIKE CARDI B, KIM KARDASHIAN AND MORE: 'I STAN HIM'\n\n\"I'm involved [with the miniseries], we've been taking over a lot of names,\" Moor revealed. \"...

It adds to the likelihood for an exciting race, and it also enhances the possibility of a nice payout for those who put it together on a winning ticket. For now, oddsmakers are calling it a two-horse race for the win, with Tacitus the 9-5 morning line favorite and War of Will at 2-1 in the latest 2019 Belmont Stakes odds. Both favorites will be popular selections, but there are plenty of opportunities to go big as well. In that regard, eight of the 10 horses in the field are at 8-1 odds or higher. That list includes Japanese entrant Master Fencer (8-1), who ran sixth at the Kentucky Derby; Everfast (12-1), the Dale Romans-trained colt who finished second to War of Will at the Preakness Stakes three weeks ago; and Bourbon War (12-1), who struggled at the Preakness but prior to that finished fourth or better in three stakes races and is bred for longer distances. With so much on the line and so many contenders to evaluate, you'll want to see the horse racing predictions from handicapper Jody Demling before locking in any of your own 2019 Belmont Stakes picks.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling comes into the 2019 Belmont on a hot streak. Two years ago, he correctly picked Tapwrit, a 5-1 underdog, to upset Irish War Cry, the 5-2 favorite. He also put Tapwrit on top of his exotics and hit the superfecta, which paid out almost $4,500 on a $2 bet.\n\nLast year at Belmont Park, he was all over Justify, jockey Mike Smith, and trainer Bob Baffert to make horse racing history. The result: Justify became just the 13th Triple Crown winner ever, and anyone who followed Demling's lead cashed in too.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world. He has hit nine of the last 11 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. That means he held a ticket with the winners of both races all but twice in the last 11 years. He's also called nine of the last 15 Preakness winners, keenly understanding when the Kentucky Derby winner was poised for victory or a massive upset.\n\nIn addition to his success in major races, Demling has called the winners of the Haskell Invitational, Pennsylvania Derby, Lecomte Stakes, Arkansas Derby, Robert B. Lewis Stakes, and Louisiana Derby, just to name a few. He nailed the superfecta at this year's Pegasus World Cup for a $678 payout on a $1 bet. He also nailed the winner, exacta, trifecta, and superfecta in the Black Eyed Susan the day before the Preakness this year. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nNow, with the 2019 Belmont Stakes lineup finalized and the post positions set, Demling is sharing his picks at SportsLine.\n\nWe can tell you that Demling likes Intrepid Heart (10-1) enough to include him in his exotics bets. He has the bloodlines and the trainer to make a difference at the Belmont Stakes 2019. Intrepid Heart made his racing debut in February, and won his first two races, then stumbled early but rebounded for third at the competitive Peter Pan Stakes.\n\nNot only does he have the pedigree for longer races, he's trained by Pletcher, who has more Belmont starters (35) and wins (3) than any other trainer with a horse in the 2019 field. And he'll be ridden by John Velazquez, who will be looking for his third Belmont Stakes in his 24th trip.\n\n\"The son of Tapit won his first two races and was third in the Peter Pan,\" Demling told SportsLine. \"He has a chance to be among the best of this crop and is fresh and ready.\"\n\nA stunner: Demling isn't high on Master Fencer, the first Japanese-bred horse in the 151 years of the Belmont. The horse was lightly regarded as the fourth qualifier for the Japanese racing Kentucky Derby qualifying series, but after the first three declined invitations, Master Fencer's team accepted. He rebounded from a poor start to end up sixth at Churchill Downs at 58-1 odds.\n\nNow he enters the Belmont Stakes 2019 at 8-1 odds, third-lowest behind only Tacitus and War of Will, as the increased distance is expected to be a benefit. However, Demling points to a recent stumble in training for this race, an incident that required x-rays (results were negative). Demling believes there will be better values on the board Saturday.\n\n\"Master Fencer ran a sneaky good race in the Kentucky Derby, but I'm cautious about the stumble in a workout,\" Demling told SportsLine. \"He's a contender to finish in the money, but there are other Belmont Stakes horses with higher odds worth backing.\"\n\nDemling has analyzed the rest of the 2019 Belmont Stakes field and believes he has identified the winner, as well as a huge long shot he loves to hit the board. He's sharing those picks, along with his entire projected 2019 Belmont Stakes leaderboard, over at SportsLine.\n\nWhich horse wins the 2019 Belmont Stakes? And which long shot will surprise?

Heading into the league's schedule release, the Patriots were expected to have the most difficult schedule based on their opponents' 2019 records. Based on projected 2020 win totals, the numbers are more favorable, but the first half of the season still projects to be the third-hardest league-wide.\n\nThere is some source of irritation surrounding one of the games on the schedule. But believe it or not, the complaint isn't coming from the Patriots. It's coming from the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nAccording to Greg A. Bedard of The Boston Sports Journal, the Rams are a bit annoyed with the logistics of their Thursday night game against the Patriots in Week 14 of the 2020 NFL season. Bedard outlined why in a recent tweet.\n\nHeard the Rams are a little irritated they're away before the Thursday night game vs. Patriots, while New England plays in the Rams' stadium. Patriots will be in their hotel by 6 PT. Rams will be landing around that time. https://t.co/4aTrsznBEW\n\nSo, in essence, the Rams are annoyed that the Patriots are getting a chance to play consecutive road games in L.A. The Patriots are playing the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 13 for a Sunday afternoon game. So, the Patriots won't have to travel extra to play the Rams as both contests are scheduled to be held at SoFi Stadium pending the completion of the project.\n\nDownload the MyTeams app for the latest Patriots news and analysis\n\nMeanwhile, the Rams are playing in Arizona on Sunday afternoon. While they won't be far away, the Patriots will still have a bit more time to rest than their counterparts.\n\nAll that said, this qualm is not only very minor, but it's not one that's guaranteed to help the Patriots. They are going to be logging a lot of miles in 2020 with road trips scheduled to play in Seattle, Kansas City, Houston, and Los Angeles and it made sense for the league to schedule their L.A. road games back to back. Otherwise, the Patriots would have to fly cross-country to Los Angeles twice.\n\nBesides, it's not like that stretch of the schedule will be kind on the Patriots anyway. They'll be playing the two games in L.A. before a pit stop at home and then a trip down to take on the Miami Dolphins in a place that they have historically struggled.\n\nThis is one of the many rough patches on the Patriots schedule. But fans will have to hope that Bill Belichick can get the team through all those tough contests with a likely first-year starter at the helm in Jarrett Stidham.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Fri May 08 20:14:16 +0000 2020", "id": 1258852739494313986, "id_str": "1258852739494313986", "full_text": "Heard the Rams are a little irritated they're away before the Thursday night game vs. Patriots, while New England plays in the Rams' stadium.

Serena, Murray pairing puts all eyes on mixed doubles", "text": "Rennae Stubbs recounts how Andy Murray came in early to sign up for the Wimbledon mixed doubles draw, which he'll play with Serena Williams. (1:48)\n\nLONDON -- When you think of the great duos in history, several probably come to mind: Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, Batman and Robin, peanut butter and jelly, Thelma and Louise, Kenan and Kel. Your list may vary slightly, but you get the idea.\n\nAnd starting this fortnight, if things live up to even a small percentage of the expectations, we'll be able to add another pairing to this esteemed list:\n\nSerena Williams and Andy Murray.\n\nOK, perhaps we're overhyping this slightly, but it's hard to think this new partnership doesn't at least have the potential for greatness. After days of Ross-and-Rachel, \"will they or won't they?\" speculation, the two confirmed they would be playing together on Tuesday night -- and the interest in the Wimbledon mixed doubles event has arguably never been greater.\n\n\"It's brilliant,\" said Heather Watson, who won the 2016 title with partner Henri Kontinen, and is back in the draw with him again this year. \"It's great that [Andy is] playing, in general. That's so positive for the game. I think it will be really exciting to watch him play with Serena.\"\n\nIt's not exactly unprecedented for big-name singles players to participate in mixed doubles -- last year saw the likes of Victoria Azarenka, Sloane Stephens and Jack Sock -- and there are some legendary winners in the event's history, including Martina Hingis, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King and Tracy Austin. However, it is rare to have two players of Williams and Murray's caliber play together.\n\nMurray, for his part, is not playing singles this year. He only made his return to competition last month at Queens after a five-month absence following hip surgery. He wasn't sure if he would ever play again due to the extreme pain he was experiencing prior to the surgery, and a tearful press conference ahead of the Australian Open in January seemed to be an end point, rather than a new beginning. Now, though, he is easing himself back by focusing on doubles only at this point. He won the men's doubles title in his first tournament back with Feliciano Lopez, and is teaming up with Pierre-Hugues Herbert in that event at the All England Club.\n\nHerbert, who has won a career Grand Slam in doubles and isn't exactly a slouch, said earlier this week he's never felt more pressure than while playing with Murray. The 32-year-old Scot, as you probably know, is as revered of a figure as they come at Wimbledon, having ended the 77-year-long singles drought for British male players in 2013. When he announced he was hoping to play in the mixed doubles event but was having trouble securing a partner, a near frenzy broke out on Twitter in response. Everyone from Billie Jean King to Maria Sharapova to his own grandmother offered their services.\n\nBut Murray stayed coy on his plans, and potential partner. Although many, many others were apparently interested in teaming up with him.\n\n\"Well, Andy Murray didn't ask me to play,\" said a joking Azarenka, who lost in the 2018 finals with Murray's brother Jamie. \"Kind of pissed about that.\"\n\nBut one can hardly blame him for picking Williams. She is widely considered one of the best to ever play the game, and has 23 Grand Slam singles titles, including seven at Wimbledon. She's as big of a superstar as tennis has. Not to mention, she won the 1998 mixed doubles event with Max Mirnyi, as well as the US Open title the same year.\n\nMurray has never won a mixed doubles title, but did take home the silver medal with partner Laura Robson during the 2012 Olympics, played at the All England Club.\n\nThe partnership, which some are calling \"Serandy,\" is shaping up to be the biggest story of the tournament. And in a year where there is no shortage of compelling stars (see: Gauff, Coco) and dramatic early matchups (hello, Rafael Nadal vs. Nick Kyrgios), that's saying something.\n\n\"[I] hope they put them on Centre Court because everyone is going to watch it,\" said Simona Halep.\n\nplay 2:09 Serena Williams, Andy Murray to team up in mixed doubles ESPN's Darren Cahill and Pam Shriver react to the news Serena Williams and Andy Murray will be combining their talents on the mixed doubles court.\n\nMixed doubles is a fixture at Grand Slams, but not played at any other WTA or ATP event, and it typically receives little fanfare. And it's not exactly where the money is, either. The winning pair will receive \u00a3116,000 (roughly $146,000) -- compared to \u00a32.35 million (around $2.9m) for the individual singles winners. It's frequently relegated to small, outer courts and receives limited, if any, television exposure until the final.\n\nHowever, while the relatively small payday remains, this year's event will not be typical in any other way.\n\n\"I think this will be the most talked-about mixed doubles draw in the history of tennis,\" said Pam Shriver, a 21-time Grand Slam doubles champion and winner of the 1987 French Open mixed doubles title, as well as a current ESPN analyst. \"It's going to be unbelievable. I'm just imagining the ovation for both of them on one of the big courts, where they'll definitely be playing, and it's going to be magic.\n\n\"They both are making major comebacks, and between Murray being the one to end the [British men's singles] drought here, and Serena and her quest to break Margaret Court's record [of 24 Grand Slam singles titles], the crowd is going to love them. I think Serena is going to feel the crowd on her side more than she's ever experienced. I don't think we'll ever see anything like this again.\"\n\nIn addition to the \"Serandy\" pairing, several other big names are joining forces, most notably Venus Williams with Frances Tiafoe and Jamie Murray with Bethanie Mattek-Sands. Nick Kyrgios is also in the draw, paired with Desirae Krawczyk. If the unseeded Serena and Andy team were to make a run, they could potentially face Venus and Tiafoe in the semifinals, and Jamie and Mattek-Sands in the final.\n\n\"I think they could end up anywhere from losing in the first round to winning it all,\" Shriver said. \"Mixed doubles is so unpredictable. But I do think they're both super motivated. The fact that Murray has come back and is focusing on doubles shows just how much he loves and enjoys the sport, and that can really help them. Same with Serena, she doesn't need to do this, but credit to her for wanting to.\"\n\nMixed doubles is a much different game from singles, or even traditional doubles, and offers a unique experience for the players and fans alike.\n\n\"Mixed doubles is definitely one of the most entertaining things you'll see on a tennis court,\" Mattek-Sands told ESPN in 2018. \"It's a different dynamic. You're gonna see some power. You're gonna see some finesse. You really have it all in mixed doubles.\n\n\"You get the guys throwing their heat on their serves, and they aren't taking it easy on the girls across the net, either. They're bringing their best serves, and then you'll see the great volleys and the touch and the strategy. I really think, for a fan, it would be one of the most interesting matches that they watch.\"\n\nThough neither Williams nor Murray has much recent experience in mixed doubles or experience playing with the other, and they are unseeded, it's hard to think these two won't be the favorites entering every match they play -- starting with Friday's opening-round match against Alexa Guarachi and Andreas Mies. After all, they have a combined nine Wimbledon singles titles to their names, so they do know a thing or two about how to win at the All England Club. And, if nothing else, at least they've gotten everyone talking -- and watching.\n\n\"I mean, good luck to everybody else,\" Azarenka said. \"It's going to be a tough, tough, tough [team] to beat. They both take it seriously. But I feel like it's going to be just a pleasure for people to watch. You know, it's going to be historic. So I'll be definitely watching, as well.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/eva-air-speed-dating-flight-intl-hnk/index.html", "authors": ["Maggie Hiufu Wong"], "title": "EVA Air launches speed dating 'flight to nowhere'", "text": "(CNN) \u2014 It might be less spiritual than the Buddhist mantra-chanting flight in Thailand, but EVA Air's latest \"flight to nowhere\" idea could be just as magical -- by helping people find love in the sky.\n\nEVA Airways, one of the largest carriers in Taiwan, is partnering with travel experience company Mobius on a campaign called \"Fly! Love is in the Air.\" These are flights for singles on Christmas Day, New Year's Eve and New Year Day.\n\n\"Because of Covid-19, EVA Air has been organizing \"faux travel\" experiences to fulfill people's desire for travel. When single men and women travel, apart from enjoying the fun in travel, they may wish to meet someone -- like a scene in a romantic movie,\" Chiang Tsung-Wei, the spokesperson for You and Me, the speed dating arm of Mobius, tells CNN Travel.\n\nEach of the dating experiences includes a three-hour flight that departs from Taipei's Taoyuan International Airport and circles the airspace above Taiwan, plus another two hours of a romantic date back on land.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to have in-depth conversations with each other on board while sampling meals prepared by Michelin-starred chef Motoke Nakamura. They are also encouraged to keep masks on when they're not eating or drinking.\n\nEach of the three trips varies slightly. The flight on Christmas Day will be followed by an afternoon tea date back on solid ground. The New Year's Eve date kicks off with a candlelit dinner before guests board the plane, where they will count down to 2021 together. The one on New Year's Day will be a breakfast date.\n\nFlight attendents will double as \"love cupids\" on EVA Air's speed dating flight, the event organizer Mobius says on its poster. Courtesy EVA Air\n\nFlights to nowhere \" have become a trend in Asia and the Pacific during the coronavirus pandemic. Until now, most of these flights -- which have originated in cities like Hong Kong, Sydney and Taipei -- focused on sightseeing, with travelers getting aerial views of famous landmarks.\n\nFor passengers on the matchmaking flights who want to look out the window as well as at fellow singles, the daytime EVA Air flights fly above the east coast of Taiwan, where they can see the mountain ranges that stretch from Hualien City in the north to Taitung City in the south.\n\nThe nighttime flight will go over the western shoreline of the island, where they will see Taiwan's cities illuminated in the darkness.\n\nUnlike a typical flight, there's no choosing window or aisle ahead of time. Participants will be seated pair by pair by lucky draw. However, they will be free to move around and chat up other travelers during the meals on land.\n\nAll three itineraries wrap up with a hearty \"confession\" section where participants reveal who they clicked with.\n\n\"The biggest advantage of speed dating on a flight comes from the serious nature from our participants,\" says Chiang. \"In addition to gathering participants with enough spending power, it also attracts a group of single people who love traveling. With the same values, it boosts participants' motivation to meet and helps smoothen their conversation from the start.\"\n\nNot just any singles could join the flights, however.\n\nEach flight seats only 40 passengers -- 20 men and 20 women. Participants have to be university graduates with citizenship in Taiwan.\n\nThe event welcomes men between 28 and 38 years old and women between 24 and 35.\n\nRelated content Qantas seven-hour flight to nowhere sells out in 10 minutes\n\nThe age specifications have gotten some negative blowback online.\n\n\"From different surveys we have done, most of the male participants would like to meet women younger than them while female participants would like to meet men older than them. That's why there is a different age criteria for the event,\" says Chiang, adding \"But You and Me have organized different dating events that cater to different age groups.\"\n\nThe fee for each trip is TWD8388 ($295) per person.

The interruptions have prompted Zoom to adjust is settings and enhance security measures. Meanwhile, the FBI is investigating several incidents known as \"Zoombombing,\" where uninvited participants hijack video chats.\n\nThe perpetrators of such attacks can be hard to identify, with some appearing to jump from one username to another to avoid detection.\n\nMost of the pranks feature shocking imagery and hateful language directed at women and minorities. The FBI sent out a nationwide alert urging users to step up cybersecurity efforts to decrease the likelihood of hijacking threats.\n\nDennis Johnson became the victim of harassment in March at a time when he should have been celebrating. Like other schools, California State Univerity in Long Beach made the switch to virtual classes and conferences as the coronavirus pandemic escalated in the United States.\n\nJohnson, a graduate student, was remotely presenting his doctoral dissertation to an audience of around 40 people -- his classmates, the dissertation committee and family members. The Chicago native is the first member of his family to graduate from college.\n\nThings took a turn, however, when an intruder scribbled a racial epithet on the video call that was seen by everyone, followed by a pornographic image.\n\n\"As I'm talking, I see this circle appear on my screen. Then another circle appears and then another shape and it's a penis that's literally being drawn on my screen,\" Johnson told Fox News. \"Everybody is watching and then the next thing I know, the word n----- appears on my screen.\n\n\"Somebody stole my moment,\" Johnson added. \"I felt so bad, I couldn't eat for the next few days after that.\"\n\nTrolls -- known as \"Zoombombers\" -- have also hijacked multiple video calls from classroom sessions, city council meetings and religious services.\n\n\"You can really simply break it down into two separate things. One is to just create disruption,\" Mark Ostrowski, a cybersecurity evangelist with Check Point Software, told Fox News of the hackers' motivations. \"Whether that's slowing somebody's service or jumping on a meeting. The second things is money. If someone is having an aboard meeting for the first time over Zoom... that's a different motive.\"\n\nCALIFORNIA CITY OFFICIAL RESIGNS AFTER ALLEGEDLY THROWING CAT DURING ZOOM MEETING\n\nLast week, a New Jersey school district announced that it would temporarily stop using Zoom after \"racist language and inappropriate images by hackers from outside of the district\" was shown to middle schoolers during an online lesson.\n\nThe incident lasted 15 seconds, the Lumberton Township School District in Burlington said in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\"The teacher and the co-host, who had been monitoring the waiting room feature in the classroom, immediately ended the session,\" District Superintendent Joseph Langowski said.\n\nWhen the Camp Hill Borough Council in Pennsylvania held its first virtual meeting on April Fools' Day, they were caught by surprise.\n\n\"We were one of the first municipalities to try and host a public meeting through Zoom just to do what we needed to do,\" Leigh Twiford, the council president, told Fox News. \"It was awful.\"\n\n\"We thought it would be a good idea to have a meeting and advertise the heck out of it so everyone knew they could join,\" she added. \"We really didn't put too many security issues in place because we wanted to make those who wanted to join could. We were pretty lax.\"\n\nIn a special meeting last week, the council took rigorous measures to ensure only serious participants were on the call, including verifying their address and putting many callers in a virtual waiting room until the meeting started. Twiford said the council's May meeting will be also be held remotely.\n\nZoom became wildly popular almost overnight as everyone's world changed in an instant. In April, 300 million people used the app daily, a sharp increase from 200 million in March and 10 million three months prior.\n\nThe uptick has also given rise to bored hackers looking for opportunities to interrupt video meetings.\n\n\u201cWe have been deeply upset to hear about these types of incidents,\" Zoom told Fox News in a statement. \"Zoom strongly condemns such behavior and recently updated several features to help our users more easily protect their meetings.\"\n\nThe platform is fighting back through a series of enhanced security measures. When it released its 5.0 version last week, it also announced extra features that include: allowing hosts to report suspicious participants, requiring complex passwords, the ability for hosts to remove participants and a default waiting room where hosts can keep participants before being admitted to meetings.\n\nTrolls are able to break into video conferences by scouring the internet for links to the chats. Some gather in various forums, like those hosted on Discord, an app where people share Zoom codes with the goal of harassing participants.\n\n\"This behavior violates Discord\u2019s Terms of Service, and we strongly condemn it,\" a Discord spokesperson told Fox News. \"Discord\u2019s Trust and Safety team continues to proactively identify and remove any servers that participate or facilitate this sort of activity.\u201d\n\nZoom's rivals have taken notice of its struggles and are offering alternatives.\n\nLast week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg added a free group video chat that accommodates up to 50 people via the Facebook or Messenger app regardless if they have a Facebook account.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGoogle is also ramping up its video group video apps in an attempt to cut into Zoom's market share.

[LHH]\n\nLots in this Elliotte Friedman update, mostly wondering what the Canadiens have planned (7x$8M for Anders Lee?!), but also pouring water on the Blue Jackets\u2019 last-ditch offer for Panarin and saying the Isles were expected to land Panarin and Varlamov. [Sportsnet]\n\nFree Agency Tracker\n\nMost of the key news is in this collection of the other names that moved fairly conclusively but not officially last night. Pavelski, Zuccarello, Bobrovsky and many more apparently decided. [LHH]\n\nOn that note, Dale Tallon tells his team\u2019s official site the Panthers expect a \u201creal positive\u201d day. That means Bobrovsky...but also maybe only Brett Connolly up front. [Panthers]\n\nFlorida wanted to be rid of James Reimer by trade...so they were able to ship him to Carolina for Scott Darling, whom they bought out. [Canes Country]\n\nThe Canadiens are expected to be aggressive (offer sheet an RFA too?) in part because their two key players are older and ready to win now.

While the majority of his career has been a display of average regular season play, and above average post-season production, the most optimistic fan will look to his 2013 season. As signal caller for the Philadelphia Eagles that year he posted a gorgeous 27/2 TD to interception count, and a QB rating of 119.2.\n\nWhile some will argue that hope is misplaced, and what you get in Foles is more a minor than major upgrade over Bortles, it cannot be argued he exists as a much better passer and an exponentially better leader.\n\nThis debate, however, is more of a red herring to the true albatross hanging over this franchise. That rhyme consists of either ignoring the position in the draft, or horrific scouting when drafting.\n\nFoles is listed on this weeks injury report with an abdominal strain. While it is not being reported as something severe, it serves as a reminder that what sits behind Foles is rookie quarterback Gardner Minshew.\n\nMinshew played the majority of the Jaguars offensive snaps during the preseason, and looked the part of a mid to late round selection. In the final game of the season his performance presented as a regression in accuracy, pocket awareness, and decision making.\n\nThe Jaguars lost the opportunity to sign the more dynamic play-maker in Alex McGough, someone they had hoped would be a practice squad candidate. Upon the Jaguars releasing the second year FIU graduate, the Houston Texans snatched him up due to third string quarterback Joe Webb being placed on IR. McGough was a seventh round pick of the Seattle Seahawks in 2018, spending that season on the practice squad.\n\nWhile McGough made the highlight reel with his legs and pocket awareness, scoring two of the three Jaguars preseason touchdowns, it would be a stretch to say he offered significantly more confidence as a regular season option over Minshew.\n\nCut earlier in the preseason was the Jaguars 2018 selection from Nebraska, Tanner Lee.\n\nThis is the crop planted and harvested under the current regime. Three late round draft picks as alternatives should your starting quarterback go down for any reason.\n\nAre the Jaguars that different from other teams with respect to quarterback depth? Chiefs have Matt Moore. Chargers have Tyrod Taylor. Patriots have Jarrett Stidham. Saints have Teddy Bridgewater. Yes. I would argue that teams with serious post-season potential are not as worried. They either have quality youth, or a trusted veteran. What you get with Minshew is a less seasoned Chad Henne.\n\nLet me be very clear. I am not banging the drum of doom, nor am I asking anyone to place hope back in its box. Ask anyone who knows me and they will tell you of my almost offensive optimism. I supported Bortles until the Kansas City game last year. I am on record as saying Nick Foles will lead this team to the Super Bowl.\n\nBut he has to be healthy for that to happen.\n\nSaid Minshew of his play against the Atlanta Falcons in the final preseason game: \u201cVery frustrating.\u201d While he led scoring drives, none of them yielded seven points.\n\nCoach Doug Marrone offered this observation.\n\nQuarterbacks and a lot of positions offensively, when you get better guys around you, you\u2019re going to do better. It\u2019s easier to evaluate if you had better guys around you and he doesn\u2019t do well, then it\u2019s easy and you shouldn\u2019t be around. \u2026 I wish there was more evidence to make it easier for him because he\u2019s worked so hard and deserves it, but it\u2019s what you do on the field.\n\nJaguars beat writer John Oehser had this to say about Minshew.\n\nThe great unknown with Minshew \u2013 and the one that Head Coach Doug Marrone mentioned several times this past week \u2013 is it\u2019s just very hard to judge his preseason performance because he was playing with backups the entire time. Would he have fared better with better protection? With a better running game? With receivers making more plays on the ball? Very possibly. In fairness to Minshew, he looked pretty much as advertised \u2013 like a smart player capable of managing the game and taking advantage of a strong running game/strong defense. That\u2019s what the Jaguars expected. That has been enough so far for him to remain the backup. I don\u2019t know how long he will stay in that role. The NFL changes fast, even at the quarterback position.\n\nThis wants for a question to the establishment: If the known variable is the talent around your quarterback, why not let your backup run with the one\u2019s?\n\nIt is a confusing maze to manage. The best this team has is a game manager that needs talent around him. A thin line for a squad needing to rely less on their defense. In Foles you have someone to elevate skill positions, which is exactly what your quarterback should do.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the question of how Minshew performs with the starters remains a mystery.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/flight-attendant-charged-intoxicated-passengers-raise-alarm/story?id=64854013", "authors": ["Abc News"], "title": "Flight attendant charged with being intoxicated after passengers raise alarm", "text": "A flight attendant was charged with criminal public intoxication on Thursday after passengers aboard a United Express flight raised alarms and one tweeted a video appearing to show her slumped over in her seat.\n\nInterested in Airlines? Add Airlines as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Airlines news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nJulianne March, 49, from Waukesha, Wisconsin, was charged with the misdemeanor by prosecutors in St. Joseph's County, Indiana. United Airlines earlier Thursday confirmed passengers had reported a flight attendant who appeared to be under the influence during the United Express flight from Chicago to South Bend, Indiana, on Aug. 2.\n\nWhen the plane landed in South Bend, officers boarded, March started crying and, when asked which city she was in, said Chicago, the criminal complaint said.\n\nAnd when administered a Breathalyzer test, her level was 0.204, five times over the legal limit for flight attendants, the complaint said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the limit for all aviation sensitive positions -- pilot, flight attendant, mechanic, for example -- is .04 for alcohol.\n\nThe flight was operated by Air Wisconsin -- meaning it was an Air Wisconsin crew and flight attendant. An Air Wisconsin spokesperson said, \"The Flight Attendant involved in this incident is no longer an employee of the company. We will continue to cooperate with local authorities and assist them as necessary.\"\n\nMarch was a probationary flight attendant who had been on the job only a few months, and was fired on the terms that she didn't complete the probationary time period, a source said.\n\nCourtesy Aaron Scherb\n\n\"We expect our regional carriers to take appropriate action as required when issues like these happen with their employees. Legally and with regards to regulatory agencies this is an Air Wisconsin issue,\" a United Airlines spokesperson told ABC News.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News on Thursday, passenger Aaron Scherb said when he boarded United Express flight 4849 from Chicago to South Bend, he noticed the sole flight attendant on the plane was acting odd.\n\nShe was \"kind of leaning against the galley and didn't seem to be making eye with passengers while boarding, which seemed a little strange,\" Scherb said, repeating an account first reported in the South Bend Tribune.\n\nAfter everyone boarded the flight and the plane was still at the gate, the flight attendant started to make the security announcement but her speech \"very slurred,\" according to Scherb.\n\nHe said he then noticed her bumping into several seats and passengers as she walked up and down the aisle to check the overhead bins.\n\nAfter the plane taxied to the runway, the flight attendant sat down in the jump seat and \"appeared to pass out for nearly the whole flight,\" Scherb recalls. Scherb said numerous other passengers took videos and photos of the flight attendant.\n\nWhile they were in the air, Scherb said a female passenger noticed the flight attendant didn't have her seat belt on and helped strap her in.\n\n\"The flight attendant didn't get up for the whole flight,\" Scherb said. \"She didn't do a security announcement or secure the cabin. When we landed, she appeared to need help opening the jet bridge.\"\n\nScherb then told one of the pilots that the flight attendant shouldn't be on a return flight, and he replied something to the effect that \"we're handling it,\" Scherb told ABC News.\n\n\"Two uniformed officers were waiting at the end of the jet bridge to interview and escort the flight attendant off the flight,\" Scherb said.\n\nScherb said he tweeted United Airlines about the experience, and a United representative contacted him later that day to offer him a $500 voucher or 25,000 miles in addition to a refund for that segment of his trip.\n\nScherb said he has not accepted either offer from United.\n\n\"Given that the safety and well-being of all 50 passengers on that flight was jeopardized, I find United's response to be insufficient,\" Scherb said. \"Especially since United had just given a $1200 voucher to a would-be passenger on the flight as we were about to board because the flight was oversold.\"\n\nSt. Josephs County Jail\n\nAnother passenger on the plane echoed the concern for safety with only the one flight attendant.\n\n\"The whole plane -- a very small plane -- noticed something was wrong when a passenger tried to contact her on the phone just before takeoff and she was in her jump seat, not strapped in, and the phone rang multiple times without her answering, which to me was the most concerning part because the pilot wasn\u2019t able to communicate with the lone flight attendant and took off anyway,\" Dan, who asked that his last name not be used, told ABC News.\n\nAt the same time, Sherb said, \"I hope this flight attendant is not fired. I would hope that United Airlines and Air Wisconsin treat this person as an employee, not as an expendable commodity, and that they will help her get treatment for addiction, if that's in fact what she suffers from. Given the significant safety and security roles that flight attendants have, United and other airlines should consider adopting zero tolerance policies for flight attendants going forward,\" he said.\n\nMarch could not be reached for comment and it was not clear whether she had a lawyer.\n\nShe was released from St. Joseph's County, Indiana, jail on her own recognizance and is due back in court on Aug. 29.\n\n\"We take safety really, really seriously and that includes being at work sober,\" Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants told ABC News. \"In this instance, the airline took swift action. I wish that it had been something that had been caught before the flight attendant was on that plane, because we also believe in helping people who are dealing with substance abuse and can get into a track for recovery.\"\n\nThe FAA said it would investigate the matter as a possible civil violation of the regulations that apply to safety-sensitive employees, prohibiting them from performing duties while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\nThe Association of Flight Attendants said in a statement: \"Substance abuse issues happen in every workplace, aviation being safety sensitive we take it incredibly seriously. There are programs that help pilots and flight attendants with addiction issues. We believe recovery is possible. The union started the Flight Attendant Drug and Alcohol Program deal with these issues.\"\n\n\"There really isn\u2019t room for error on safety, there is a high standard,\" Nelson said. \"There is a very clear standard for crew members who are in safety sensitive roles and you can\u2019t have any impairment in those conditions.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.thegamer.com/twitch-dr-disrespect-lift-ban/", "authors": ["Scott Baird"], "title": "Dr Disrespect's Ban Was Justified, But Twitch Has A History Of Bad Judgment", "text": "Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n\nThe bad boy of Twitch, Dr Disrespect, received a suspension from the streaming site after disrespecting California privacy laws at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles. His account was removed right after his stream ended and neither Twitch nor Dr Disrespect has commented on the length of the suspension or the severity of his punishment.\n\nThis ban is one of several recent high profile bans on Twitch and no matter how Twitch decides to deal with it this story, it will undoubtedly weave into the colorful tapestry of streamer suspensions. Fans are already speculating wildly about what this will mean for \"Two Times\" channel and we can hardly blame them; if you know anything about how Twitch handles rule breakers, you know it is often inconsistent and unfair.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: Dr Disrespect Banned From Twitch For Filming Teenagers Peeing In E3 Bathroom\n\nvia Dexerto\n\nTwitch's Rules And Guidelines\n\nTwitch handles suspensions on a case by case basis. This is partly because the world of streaming is constantly growing and a rigid set of rules couldn't be applied to every unprecedented issue that comes up. The other part of this, which it no doubt picked up from other social media sites like Twitter, is that if you don't tell people what the rules are, then you can punish or not punish offenders however you see fit at the time.\n\nTwitch's official help article on suspensions states: \"We suspend accounts that violate our Terms of Service and/or Community Guidelines. Most violations will result in a temporary suspension of one day up to 30 days, and a strike on the account. We may also remove content associated with the violation. If your account is suspended, you may not access or use Twitch services, including watching streams, broadcasting, and chatting. After the suspension is complete, you will be able to use our services once again. After two strikes, the next violation will result in an indefinite suspension, but some severe violations will result in an indefinite suspension on the first violation.\"\n\nvia Twitch\n\nAs you can see, this language is deliberately vague. \"Most\" violations will result in a temporary suspension for an arbitrary amount of days between one and 30, but \"some severe violations\" will result in a perma-ban. This is all very subjective and has led to a backlash from streamers and viewers who have become the victims of unfair and inconsistent punishment, and it's happening more and more often.\n\nPrevious Twitch Bans\n\nLeague Of Legends streamer Pink Ward was suspended for 30 days for supposedly saying the N-word on his stream. Pink Ward claims he said the word \"yikers,\" which is also tough to make out, but if you watch the clip it's obvious he didn't say the racial slur. However, a 30-day ban was upheld. He posted an update video on his YouTube channel explaining to his fans that Twitch ignored his appeal and closed the ticket without comment. This also puts him in a kind of probation when he returns, which means that he will not be eligible for Twitch Partner for the next four months.\n\nRELATED: Twitch Chat Crashed Amidst UMG Friday Fortnite Hype\n\nThis would be an easier pill to swallow if all situations in which streamers were misheard and believed to be violating the terms of service were treated the same way. However, this isn't the case. Team Liquid player TF Blade was in an almost identical situation when his account was banned for 30 days in April. Twitch Moderators believed that TF Blade also used the N-word on stream, though he claims he only said \"idiots.\" After an outpouring of support from his viewers and Team Liquid, his suspension was reduced from 30 days to one week. However, it's unclear why Pink Ward wasn't given the same treatment.\n\nThese situations are not unique in the slightest. Recently, a number of World Of Warcraft streamers have been banned for talking about the sea creature \"Nagas.\" At the moment, these suspensions are indefinite and potentially permanent. Twitch never comments on these types of bans and the streamers themselves are rarely provided with information about why they are banned or for how long.\n\nWhen it comes to \"severe violations\" that result in permanent bans, the cases are varied and the severity of the offense is often debatable. Back in February, popular streamer HelenaLive received a permanent ban purportedly for saying \"there are only two genders\" on stream. Granted, this was her third offense for what Twitch labeled \"hate speech.\" Twitch has banned streamers for receiving subs bought with stolen credit cards, for overly sexual content (but not others,) and even for listening to a song.\n\nThough some assume that Dr Disrespect assume is too popular to receive any kind of punishment - and it certainly seems like some streamers receive preferential treatment - streamers with huge audiences can and have been banned. In 2017, one of the pioneers of IRL streaming Ice_Poseidon was banned after a viewer called in a bomb threat for the plane he was on. When his channel went down, Ice_Poseidon had almost 300,000 followers and 14.5 million views.\n\nvia Dexerto\n\nThen, there is MrDeadMoth, a Fortnite streamer who assaulted his wife on stream. He was arrested but was only given a two-week suspension from Twitch. When he returned to streaming, people were (rightfully) very upset and he was eventually re-banned, this time permanently.\n\nWhat happens to Dr Disrespect remains unclear. Likely, he will only receive the minimum punishment of 24 hours since this is his first offense, but as you can see, there is nothing to base that assumption on. Twitch is notoriously inconsistent and uncommunicative when it comes to these situations. It's a problem that is only becoming worse and, despite revising its community guidelines in February, there is simply too much ambiguity about how it handles violations. Perhaps high profile cases like this will bring attention to the problem, or it might be the last we will hear of Dr Disrespect.\n\nREAD NEXT: Why Dragon Quest's Heroes Deserve To Be Smash DLC - For Everyone Complaining About It\n\nE3 2019: Smash Ultimate's Banjo-Kazooie DLC Might Pave The Way For Master Chief", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.papermag.com/nicki-minaj-pregnancy-2639364848.html", "authors": ["Brendan Wetmore", "Emlyn Travis", "Paper Magazine", "Sandra Song"], "title": "Did Nicki Minaj Just Announce Her Pregnancy?", "text": "Well, there are just blessings on top of blessings coming out of the debut Chance the Rapper record, The Big Day. \"'Bout to walk down the aisle and be a mommy,\" is the verse on everyone's lips today, a line from Nicki Minaj's feature on the finale song, \"Zanies and Fools.\" Speculation has been rampant this month about the status of the rapper's relationship with her boyfriend, Kenneth Petty, and she confirmed on her Queen Radio show recently that she had, in fact, obtained a marriage license.\n\nNow, the Barbz have been buzzing about the possibility of Minaj being pregnant \u2014 a rumor that took flight after she tweeted about a recent collaboration between herself, Jimmy Fallon, and Red Lobster.

(Salvatore Di Nolfi/Keystone FILE via AP)\n\nGENEVA (AP) \u2014 As the coronavirus explodes again, the World Health Organization finds itself both under intense pressure to reform and holding out hope that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will reverse a decision by Washington to leave the health agency.\n\nWith its annual meeting underway this week, WHO has been sharply criticized for not taking a stronger and more vocal role in handling the pandemic. For example, in private internal meetings in the early days of the virus, top scientists described some countries\u2019 approaches as \u201can unfortunate laboratory to study the virus\u201d and a \u201cmacabre\u201d opportunity to see what worked, recordings obtained by The Associated Press show. Yet in public, the U.N. health agency lauded governments for their responses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBiden has promised to overturn President Donald Trump\u2019s decision in June to cut off funds to WHO and withdraw the U.S. WHO has also bowed to demands from member countries for an independent panel to review its management of the pandemic response, and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday that the agency welcomed \u201cany and all attempts\u201d to strengthen it \u201cfor the sake of the people we serve.\u201d\n\nOne of the central dilemmas facing the WHO is that it has no enforcement powers or authority to independently investigate within countries. Instead, the health agency relies on behind-the-scenes talks and the cooperation of member states.\n\nCritics say WHO\u2019s traditional aversion to confronting its member countries has come at a high price. As COVID-19 spread, WHO often shied away from calling out countries, as big donors such as Japan, France and Britain made repeated mistakes, according to dozens of leaked recordings of internal WHO meetings and documents from January to April obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nSome public health experts say WHO\u2019s failure to exert its influence lent credence to countries adopting risky outbreak policies, possibly compromising efforts to stop the virus.\n\n\u201cWe need WHO to be bold and to use their political power to name and shame because the consequences are so devastating,\u201d said Sophie Harman, a professor of international politics at Queen Mary University in London. \u201cThis is their Spanish flu moment \u2026 By not speaking up when countries are doing questionable things, WHO is undermining its own authority while the planet burns.\u201d\n\nOthers said it would be politically unwise for WHO to be too outspoken unless countries give the agency more power and the ability to censure countries \u2014 an option that Germany and France have recently proposed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf Tedros was to take a very aggressive stance toward member countries, there would be repercussions,\u201d said Suerie Moon, co-director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute of Geneva, referring to WHO\u2019s director-general.\n\nWHO spokeswoman Farah Dakhlallah said that since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, \u201cWHO officials have had and continue to have, frank and open discussions with government counterparts \u2026 We are proud of an organizational culture that fosters candid discussion with the aim of reaching life-saving solutions.\u201d\n\nOne of the scientists in the meetings, emergencies chief Dr. Michael Ryan, also laid out WHO\u2019s approach in answer to a media question March 11 on whether the agency was willing to say which countries weren\u2019t doing enough.\n\n\u201cThe answer to that question is, you know who you are,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe WHO doesn\u2019t interact in public debate or criticize our member states in public. What we try to do is work with our member states constructively.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unprecedented, however, for WHO to publicly question its member states. It threatened to close its China office when the country was hiding cases during the SARS outbreak, loudly called for Nigeria to reverse its boycott of the polio vaccine in 2003 and accused Tanzania of not sharing enough information about an Ebola epidemic last year.\n\nThe review of WHO\u2019s role in the pandemic comes at a critical time because the agency is now tasked with helping to buy and distribute coronavirus vaccines around the world once any prove effective, especially to poorer nations. Some countries, including the U.S. and Russia, have refused to join the effort, but on Sunday, WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said she hoped Biden\u2019s election would \u201copen the door\u201d to U.S. inclusion.\n\nWHO\u2019s reticence to call out countries started with China, as the AP earlier reported . Despite a January meeting between Tedros and Chinese President Xi Jinping, information on the outbreak was still sparse throughout February. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s technical lead for COVID-19, noted that the agency lacked \u201cenough detail to say what has worked and what hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYet at a media briefing shortly afterwards, Tedros said, \u201cChina is doing many good things that are slowing the virus and the facts speak for themselves.\u201d\n\nAlso in February, WHO scientists were concerned about Japan. On Feb. 1, a passenger who disembarked the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus. At the ship\u2019s next stop in Yokohama, 10 more cases were found and authorities put all 3,711 people on board under lockdown.\n\nRyan told reporters at the time: \u201cLet\u2019s be careful here not to overreact.\u201d But on Feb. 10, the case count nearly doubled overnight.\n\n\u201c(That\u2019s) not surprising given the nature of the response of the investigation,\u201d Ryan said at an internal meeting, saying only a small number of epidemiologists had been assigned to the outbreak. \u201cIf you double the number of cases in a ship in a day, something is not right.\u201d\n\nDr. Thomas Grein, WHO\u2019s chief of acute events management team, reported to his colleagues that WHO had discussed the outbreak with their Japanese counterparts, but failed to glean much useful information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very sensitive issue and we need to tread carefully,\u201d he warned.\n\nAlthough WHO was keenly aware the situation was deteriorating, scientists said the outbreak could help in understanding COVID-19 transmission patterns.\n\n\u201c(It\u2019s) unfortunate, but a useful opportunity to study the natural history of the virus,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nSeveral days later, Japanese outbreak specialist Dr. Kentaro Iwata went aboard the Diamond Princess and called the response \u201ccompletely chaotic.\u201d Soon afterward, WHO announced more than half of the world\u2019s known COVID-19 cases outside China were aboard the Diamond Princess.\n\n\u201cIt was very obvious on that cruise ship that things were going badly wrong and WHO should have said something,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on Public Health Law and Human Rights at Georgetown University. \u201cWhen what countries are doing is flat-out wrong, we need WHO to say so.\u201d\n\nWhile WHO wasn\u2019t specific, Tedros said on Feb. 26: \u201cOne of the biggest challenges we face is that too many affected countries are still not sharing data with WHO.\u201d\n\nThroughout February and March, COVID-19 triggered outbreaks in South Korea, Singapore, Iran and elsewhere. The virus also gained a foothold in Italy, turning Europe into the epicenter of the pandemic.\n\nAt WHO, officials worried in internal meetings about the lack of information from European member states. Grein said WHO\u2019s efforts to get more detail about the spiraling outbreaks had \u201cspectacularly failed.\u201d\n\nYet on March 8, Tedros tweeted that \u201cthe government & the people of Italy are taking bold, courageous steps aimed at slowing the spread of the #coronavirus & protecting their country & world.\u201d Three days later, Tedros declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, saying the announcement was made partly due to \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by countries, which he didn\u2019t name.\n\nGeorgetown University\u2019s Gostin said WHO should be obligated to publicly report when countries aren\u2019t sharing enough data.\n\n\u201cIf a country is not providing vital epidemiological or biological information, then WHO and the world are flying blind in an outbreak and we can\u2019t have that,\u201d he said.\n\nWHO also complained in private about Western countries hoarding scarce pandemic supplies.\n\n\u201cWe had the terrible situation yesterday with (protective personal equipment) where all the supplies were requisitioned in France and we lost access,\u201d Ryan told his colleagues. He said WHO needed to pressure countries and companies to avoid similar situations.\n\nAs countries across Europe moved to adopt social distancing measures and cancel mass gatherings in early March, Ryan noticed one country didn\u2019t: Britain.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a single sports event in Europe and yet all of the Premier League matches in the U.K. are to go ahead as normal,\u201d he said. Ryan described Britain\u2019s pandemic strategy as \u201cproblematic\u201d after hearing the U.K.\u2019s chief scientific officer publicly say the country was aiming for herd immunity.\n\n\u201cFor that to happen, hundreds of thousands and millions of older people are going to become infected and there is just going to be so much death,\u201d Ryan said. Still, he said, the different approaches to tackling COVID-19 globally could prove to be \u201ca massive ecological study\u201d that would allow WHO to document what worked best.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s macabre in some ways, but it\u2019s reality,\u201d he said.\n\nGoing forward, WHO\u2019s role in the continued unfolding of the pandemic will depend in part on the panel review. Harman, the expert from Queen Mary University, sympathized that WHO had enormous responsibility in the early months of COVID-19, but said even greater challenges loom now.\n\n\u201cThis is not an experiment for WHO to learn lessons for the future, the stakes are too high for that,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the next wave of the pandemic, I think the time for quiet diplomacy has passed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJamey Keaten in Geneva, and Dake Kang, in Beijing contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/09/21/marvel-avengers-endgame-stars-brie-larson-paul-rudd-insults-zach-galifianakis-insults-between-two-ferns-movie/", "authors": [], "title": "Zach Galifianakis Insults Marvel Stars to Their Faces in Between Two Ferns Movie", "text": "Zach Galifianakis roasts Avengers: Endgame stars Brie Larson and Paul Rudd in Netflix original movie Between Two Ferns: The Movie, released to the streaming service on Friday.

If you pitter-patter in the hole at all at this level, you\u2019re (going to get) hit in the backfield. So that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to continue to harp on him. He has improved, but he\u2019s still got a ways to go.\u201d\n\nThe Packers put on full pads for the first time Sunday. Williams ripped off several nice runs in teams drills, including one long run that showed his improving patience to the perimeter, per Ryan Wood of PackersNews.com.\n\nLaFleur and the Packers have been working with all the running backs on getting to \u201clandmarks\u201d and setting up blocks in the outside zone run scheme. Williams has impressive acceleration and one-cut ability, which should be perfect for the scheme, but like any rookie, he\u2019ll need to adjust to the speed of the pro game.\n\nAs it stands now, Williams is the offense\u2019s third running back.\n\nHe\u2019ll have a chance to earn a role in the offense, but LaFleur was honest about his rookie\u2019s need for more development early on at training camp. Williams must continue to adjust and improve as camp rolls on in Green Bay.\n\nDavis making plays: Receiver Trevor Davis has turned a standout performance during the offseason workout program into a strong start at training camp. During Sunday\u2019s practice, Davis won several one-on-one matchups and created a few big plays in the passing game.\n\nThe Packers now need to see Davis do it consistently, both in practice and in preseason games.\n\n\u201cI thought Trevor had a solid OTAs,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cFor him, can you consistently do it day in and day out?

Giddy and in the arms of a new love in a Mexico hotel, she waves at her adopted daughter Beth from across the lobby.\n\nFilming that scene was a bit of a whirlwind for the person playing her, too. Weeks after filming the performances that became the recently released \u201cWhat the Constitution Means to Me,\u201d Marielle Heller landed in Berlin and hours later was in costume and in character. After spending a majority of the last half-decade as a director of the films \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,\u201d \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d and \u201cThe Diary of a Teenage Girl,\u201d that particular sequence as Alma was just one part of the front-of-camera switch-up she\u2019d been looking for.\n\n\u201cWhen I said yes to doing \u2018Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u2019 I was feeling burned out on directing and movie-wise wasn\u2019t sure what my next big project was going to be. So I said yes to doing this very different type of project that required a different skill set from me, sort of just to shake things up, if anything,\u201d Heller said in an interview with IndieWire. \u201cThe production designer [Uli Hanisch] is so talented. The sets and the costumes were incredible. It\u2019s fun to look back with hindsight now and realize that it was sort of a last hurrah before our major shutdown. I look back on it and think, \u2018Oh my gosh, how wonderful that was to get to go have a last adventure.'\u201d\n\nRelated 'Narcos: Mexico' Renewed for Season 3, Diego Luna Not Returning\n\n'Bly Manor's' Lesbian Love Story Is No Cause to Celebrate Related 'Bridgerton': Everything You Need to Know About Shonda Rhimes' First Netflix Show\n\nOscars 2021: Best International Feature Film Predictions\n\nPart of what makes Alma such a compelling character in this series is the way that Heller uses audience expectations. For about half of \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d Alma tries her best to be a mother for Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy), the up-and-coming chess sensation trying to juggle her potential and her present. So often in stories about prodigies, this sort of dynamic reverts to an overbearing parental figure taking out their pent-up anger and frustration on the talented youngster in their care.\n\nThat gets flipped right from Alma\u2019s introduction. When she and her husband arrive at the institution where a young Beth is being raised, there is an element of Alma keeping up a happy housewife facade. Still, Heller brings a warmth to the character that might not be obvious at first, but starts to assuage some of the fears that Beth\u2019s new home might be a dangerous one.\n\nPhil Bray/Netflix\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sweet nervousness to the whole thing. I think Alma doesn\u2019t know how to interact with children. There\u2019s such a formality to her and she\u2019s so locked in this loveless marriage and feels so constrained by her life in so many ways. It was a lot to try to get across pretty quickly,\u201d Heller said.\n\nA majority of Heller\u2019s screentime in \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit\u201d comes alongside Taylor-Joy as Alma and Beth travel from their Kentucky home to far-flung chess tournaments. There\u2019s a certain gracefulness in how series director Scott Frank writes Alma that defies any stage mom trope, and the on-screen give-and-take between Heller and Taylor-Joy makes sure that there\u2019s a meeting in the middle for these two women.\n\n\u201cPart of what I loved on the page about the role was this relationship, which I found really complicated and hard to understand at first. I liked the way it built, that the relationship wasn\u2019t easily won, that it took a lot of work to get to a place where the two women trusted each other,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThey\u2019re like feral animals who have both been in isolation and then suddenly are forced to live with the other person and are like sniffing each other out for so long before they decide to really trust each other. And I thought that would be fun challenge to play, to get to really build a relationship in that way.\u201d\n\nFilmmaking can be an intimidating cerebral balancing act. For the challenge of playing Alma, Heller didn\u2019t want the clarity of Alma\u2019s evolution to get overpowered by overthinking. The audience comes to understand how much Alma\u2019s drinking is a constant presence in her life \u2014 in playing that, though, Heller never lets it pull focus. It becomes part of what Alma and Beth ultimately share, without ever having the overly physical breakdown that usually goes hand-in-hand with portrayals of alcoholism.\n\n\u201cPlaying intoxicated is such a tricky thing. And it\u2019s so often done terribly. I think it\u2019s sort of a pet peeve of mine as a director: If somebody has to be intoxicated, I need them to do it really well. I dealt with it a lot on \u2018Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u2019 and had two actors who were really good at it,\u201d Heller said. \u201cI tried not to harp on it too much with my thinking about the role because I didn\u2019t want to get in my head about it. If you\u2019re thinking about playing drunk, you\u2019re in trouble. It\u2019s much more about letting yourself be emotionally present. Maybe letting your muscles loosen up in different ways. Alma\u2019s drinking through the whole thing, but she goes from being so tightly wound to much more loose. So it was more about the bigger emotional arc that I was thinking about.\u201d\n\nThat journey often means playing two ideas at the same time. Alma comes to be both a confidant and a guide. She protects Beth by encouraging her to pursue life beyond the game she knows so well. Heller responded to the show\u2019s tiny moments of levity, when Alma cuts against what you might expect a mother in the late 1960s to want for and from her daughter.\n\nPhil Bray/Netflix\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much more true to life to have these sort of unexpected reactions and it told me a lot about who she is as a woman deep down, almost looking at her younger self. Who she could have been, who she would have been in a different world in a different time,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThere\u2019s something so interesting about the generational pull between the two characters, because Beth is able to do things that Alma never was. She\u2019s at once jealous and also loves it for Beth. She\u2019s living vicariously through her and also can say, \u2018I never got that.'\u201d\n\nJust as her introductory scene avoids a stereotypical entrance, there\u2019s a certain kind of grace in how Alma exits the story. A lesser show would have everything but a neon sign telling Beth that she needs to appreciate Alma while she\u2019s still alive. One of their final hotel room scenes captures these characters\u2019 tender understanding of each other without telegraphing the tragedy that\u2019s just around the corner.\n\n\u201cThat was our biggest worry throughout, whether it was going to be too obvious. You never want to be playing any of those notes in too heavy a way or lean in too hard. You want to feel like it\u2019s all done with a light touch, so you\u2019re allowed to be surprised when things go a different way,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThere\u2019s a really sweet moment that we found toward the end, when Alma comes in late at night and Beth\u2019s asleep and she says, \u2018You can turn on the light.\u2019 I ended up lying my head on her hip. It was a scene that had one tone in the script, where it was much more telegraphing that Alma was sick. The crux of the scene ends up being this mother-daughter switch where suddenly Alma\u2019s lying her head in Beth\u2019s lap, and she\u2019s caring for her in this very sweet way. And that scene weirdly became something new when we were playing it than I think it was on the on the page. It really helped end our relationship in a very sweet way.\u201d\n\nWith her first three features, Heller found a way to make stories set in the past speak to the current moment. Of her two most recent projects, that connection is more explicit in \u201cWhat the Constitution Means to Me\u201d than \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Gambit,\u201d but both are bridges to understanding both the changes and consistencies in American life over the past half-century. Though there are plenty of variables facing any artist over the coming months, Heller said that she\u2019s not sure where her recent work might lead her next.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I would have made \u2018A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u2019 had Trump not been president.

He said: \u201cAgree with all of this. One Nation values have never been more important.\u201d\n\nThree years ago, the then leader of the Leave campaign clashed with Rudd in one of the referendum debates, when she said: \u201cBoris is the life and soul of the party but you wouldn\u2019t want him to drive you home at the end of the evening.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Boris Johnson's resignation letter Show all 2 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. Boris Johnson's resignation letter 1/2 2/2 1/2 2/2\n\nPart of this assumption dated from the extraordinary events of 1 July 2016, when Michael Gove shocked Westminster by ditching Johnson, his ally, to stand as a candidate himself, and when Johnson ended his leadership campaign launch speech by saying: \u201cI have concluded that person cannot be me.\u201d\n\nThe feeling lingered that Johnson: a) had embarrassingly few supporters among Tory MPs, and, b) lacked the character to press ahead against adversity. Johnson did little to advance his claim as a candidate of the future during his unimpressive stint as foreign secretary.\n\nHe had already lost most of the cross-party and cross-generational appeal that helped him win the mayoralty of a Labour city (twice) by becoming the public face of the Brexit campaign.\n\nNevertheless, he remained one of the best-known politicians in the country, with a reputation as a campaigner.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s failure to deliver Brexit on 29 March means that her premiership is now close to its end, in circumstances that favour Johnson. As a Brexiteer who resigned from the government rather than be associated with the compromises of the withdrawal agreement, he has moved to the front of a wide field of leadership hopefuls.\n\nAs it goes, the betting markets suggest he has only a 36 per cent chance of being the next permanent Tory leader, which implies that gamblers still have doubts about his support among fellow MPs \u2013 although two recent surveys of party members, by Conservative Home and YouGov, suggest he would defeat all comers if he made it to the final stage.\n\nRudd\u2019s rapprochement is significant evidence that some Tory Remainer MPs accept Johnson may be the least bad choice. Many of them would rather have the buffoon they know than, say, Dominic Raab, who served too briefly as Brexit secretary to make his mark.\n\nRudd is assumed by some Westminster cynics to want to be the first female chancellor, and it would help Johnson present a united front if he appointed her \u2013 although his to-and-fro with Andrea Leadsom in the fumbled early stages of the last leadership contest suggest that any promises he might give would not be bankable.\n\nBut One Nation Tories can also convince themselves that Johnson was once a pro-immigration, liberal Tory mayor of London \u2013 and that he would be a better prospect as prime minister than some of the more ideological Leavers, who are the only realistic alternatives to lead a party whose members now want a no-deal Brexit by two to one.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27580546/ninja-style-headwear-no-longer-allowed-nba", "authors": ["Adrian Wojnarowski", "Nick Depaula", "Zach Lowe"], "title": "'Ninja-style headwear' no longer allowed in NBA", "text": "Will Cain doesn't see the Miami Heat with Jimmy Butler going very far in the playoffs and questions Butler's decision.

It has a stock market value of $242 million.\n\nSeven of the PPP loans to Long Island\u2019s public companies were made by JPMorgan & Chase Co. and HSBC Bank USA, both in Manhattan, and BNB Bank Inc. in Bridgehampton.\n\n\u201cThere have been isolated instances where companies have been identified as incompatible with the implied objectives of the PPP initiative,\u201d said BNB CEO Kevin O\u2019Connor. \u201cHowever, the SBA did not specifically exclude public companies in the legislation, so the granting of loans to these companies was appropriate at the time.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf the companies in question pursuant to public pressure decide to change their view of this financing, we will accommodate them.\u201d The loans to public companies represent less than 1% of the almost $900 million in PPP loans made by the bank as of April 16.\n\nBNB loaned $3 million to P&F Industries Inc. and $4.8 million to CPI Aerostructures Inc.\n\nP&F CEO Richard Horowitz said the money was key to \u201cmaintain our workforce while we manage through this crisis and continue to manufacture and distribute our products\u2026. many of which are critical to the ongoing operation of many essential and life sustaining industries.\u201d\n\nThe Melville manufacturer of power tools has 195 employees and reported a profit of $4.9 million last year on sales of $58 million.

It has a stock market value of $39 million.\n\nThe PPP consists of banks and other private lenders making loans of up to $10 million, generally to businesses with 500 or fewer employees. The interest rate is 1% with a two-year term and the entire amount is forgivable in some instances. Newsday has secured a $10 million loan.\n\nThe federal CARES Act, which created the PPP, didn\u2019t include oversight measures so public companies \u201cwere given a free pass to suck the program\u2019s funding dry as many small businesses walked away with little to nothing,\u201d said Kyle Herrig, president of the government watchdog group Accountable.US in Washington.\n\nLoan amounts are based on a company\u2019s headcount and payroll expenses \u2013 the more employees, the larger the loan \u2013 because the purpose is to prevent layoffs for two months.\n\nThe largest loan to an LI public company, $6.7 million, went to TSR Inc., which is weighing whether to use the money.\n\nThe IT staffing company in Hauppauge has 389 employees, of which 340 are W-2 contractors, which means they work for a TSR customer but are paid by TSR. If they were 1099 independent contractors, they couldn\u2019t be paid using PPP funds, according to SBA officials.\n\n\u201cWhen we saw the wave of shutdowns and work stoppages coming, we decided to apply for the Paycheck Protection Program because we want to preserve our workforce,\u201d said CEO Thomas Salerno. \u201cI cannot give you an answer on how or even if we are going to use it. We\u2019re trying to assess what\u2019s going to happen over the next few months and long term,\u201d he said.\n\nSalerno, who became CEO as the coronavirus struck Long Island, said some TSR employees are unable to work and others are working remotely because of the shutdown of nonessential activities to reduce the virus\u2019 spread. The company hasn\u2019t laid off or furloughed workers, he said.\n\nTSR reported a loss of $1.3 million last year on revenue of $63 million. It has a stock-market value of about $7 million.\n\n\u201cThis is the equivalent of a humanitarian effort,\u201d Salerno said, referring to the PPP. \u201cI want to protect our employees and shareholders and keep TSR solvent and running \u2013 but if we don\u2019t use the PPP funds we will follow the letter of the law\u201d and repay the loan.\n\nThe anger of small business owners is directed more toward banks than the public companies that they said took advantage of lax regulations.\n\nAt his 3,000-square-foot automotive body shop, Waldeck said the federal government needs to pressure lenders to make more PPP loans to small businesses. He said he needs about $10,000 to keep operating his one-person firm.\n\n\"The problem is the banks are ignoring the small businesses,\" Waldeck said. Once the banks received the loan guarantees, \"they turned around and gave loans to their friends at the big corporations because it benefited them.

Murthy has been considered for that role,while New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D), had been considered a leading candidate although she is said to be out of the running. She has the emphatic support of Latino organizations and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThese names reflect the latest internal thinking, but the chess pieces are still in motion, and final decisions have not jelled, according to a variety of individuals close to the Biden transition. The individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel choices that have not yet been made.\n\nAccording to these individuals, the president-elect is moving at a deliberate pace, wanting to be certain he assembles a competent, harmonious team for what he regards as job No. 1 among the issues he is inheriting. The individuals say that Biden believes he bought himself a little time by having rapidly formed his 13-member coronavirus advisory board for the transition.\n\nBut having announced his national security team last week and his economic team Tuesday, pressure is intensifying to reveal his health care leadership, and several individuals said decisions could be announced as early as next week.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Biden transition declined to comment on the selections.\n\nMax Skidmore, a political scientist at the University of Missouri at Kansas City who has studied presidential leadership during previous pandemics, said that selecting a competent team with experience in dealing with public health crises is \u201cabsolutely essential given the seriousness\u201d of the coronavirus\u2019 toll. Cases of covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, and hospitalizations are reaching record levels as the nation surpassed 200,000 new daily infections for the first time Wednesday. Nearly 14 million U.S. cases have been reported overall, and at least 272,000 people have died, according to data tracked by The Washington Post.\n\nSkidmore said Biden should choose a team with the capacity to coordinate its strategy as flawlessly as possible across the government. \u201cI think the appointing of a coronavirus czar would be a very good idea,\u201d he said, noting that forging a unified national approach to public health \u201crequires a team but also requires coordination of the team. Not only did the current president not have that, he abdicated responsibility to 50 state governors.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBiden and those close to him have relentlessly slammed President Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic, and the president-elect intends to mount a more muscular response to try to lessen the widespread harm it has caused Americans physically and economically.\n\nThey intend to centralize more pandemic policy decisions within the White House and have emphasized that they intend to replace the Trump administration\u2019s approach of deference to states with a strong federal hand over elements such as testing and vaccine distribution \u2014 and related policies, such as expanding insurance coverage and narrowing the racial and ethnic disparities the pandemic has highlighted.\n\nAccording to people who know Zients and Murthy, including a few who have worked with both, the two men have very different skills. Biden\u2019s team admires Zients\u2019s management abilities \u2014 as a business executive before he joined the Obama administration, and later working for that president, as acting director of the Office of Management and Budget as well as chief economic adviser, said two individuals close to the transition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nZients has no background in medicine or public health. But he is credited with stepping in to coordinate a repair of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance enrollment website, HealthCare.gov, when it proved so defective at the outset that some consumers could not use it to buy health plans.\n\nTrained in internal medicine, Murthy also has been mentioned for a possible White House role as chief clinician and public communicator about the pandemic. He was an early supporter of Biden, who relied on him during the campaign to shape his health care stances, and who grew to admire him intensely, according to individuals with insight into their relationship.\n\nMurthy has not managed large organizations before. He created an advocacy group of physicians supporting Barack Obama for president and, later, to advocate for affordable health care. He was a vice admiral in the U.S. Public Health Service and, as surgeon general, focused on efforts to address the nation\u2019s opioid crisis. The Senate had held up his nomination for surgeon general for about a year, because of his support for gun controls.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe HHS secretary\u2019s role also will be pivotal, since the department includes agencies critical to bringing the pandemic under control: the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the public health service.\n\nLujan Grisham, New Mexico\u2019s governor, has been regarded as a leading possibility for that job. It is unclear why she is no longer in contention. The Biden team offered her the role of interior department secretary, but she declined, a source familiar with the events said. She has at least twice publicly dismissed the idea that she would have a leading health care role in the administration. \u201cWhile I\u2019m incredibly honored and flattered that my colleagues can see the work that I\u2019m doing on the ground and know that I\u2019ve got 40 years in comprehensive health care experience,\u201d she told CNN this week, \u201cI\u2019m focused on making sure that I\u2019m saving New Mexico lives.\u201d\n\nGovernors have often, but not always, been chosen for the job of HHS secretary. Within the Biden crew, \u201cthere is some sense inside they need a doctor\u201d to lead the department during the pandemic, according to one individual familiar with the transition\u2019s perspective. It is unclear how pervasive that view is among the transition\u2019s nominating team.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDuring a virtual roundtable Wednesday with a group of Americans who have experienced economic hardship during the pandemic, Biden praised his transition advisory council as \u201cthe leading doctors in the world.\u201d He said \u201chelp is on the way in terms of vaccines\u201d but stressed that delivering them, once they are approved by federal regulators, will be an expensive and difficult task.\n\nAs a result, he said, Americans need to remain vigilant for months ahead.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.mercurynews.com/carolyn-hax-side-eye-reactions-leave-me-confused", "authors": ["Carolyn Hax"], "title": "Carolyn Hax: These side-eye reactions leave me confused", "text": "DEAR CAROLYN: I have a lovely mother-in-law.

The declaration is a prerequisite for issuing recommendations to countries on guidelines to combat the outbreak.\n\nStill, Chinese media announced plans to stop travel out of Wuhan, starting Thursday.\n\nAhead of time in the U.S. on Friday, the CDC announced entry health screenings for the virus at airports receiving the most traffic from Wuhan: San Francisco International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nCDC officials on Tuesday announced plans for additional screenings at airports in Chicago and Atlanta, along with plans to reroute all flights from Wuhan to the five airports for the additional screenings.\n\nAs of Wednesday, it appeared some indirect flights from Wuhan were arriving at Detroit Metro Airport without stops at any of the five selected airports, according to flight statuses shown by individual airlines.\n\nSo, what about Michigan?\n\nA spokeswoman for the Detroit Metro Airport directed questions to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the CDC.\n\nThough Chief U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer Ken Hammond did not respond to questions specific to Detroit, he released a statement noting the efforts made at the five U.S. airports.\n\n\u201cIn coordination with the CDC, CBP has measures already in place to identify travelers with overt signs of illness at ports of entry who may be potentially infected with a communicable disease and to minimize the risk to the traveling public,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cThis enhanced screening will be for symptoms specifically related to the 2019-nCoV and will be conducted by CDC personnel upon arrival.\u201d\n\nThe CDC also did not respond to request for comment on how passengers would be screened at other points of entry, such as Detroit\u2019s airport and the border with Canada.\n\nU.S. Rep.

That\u2019s just their share of upfront premiums, and doesn\u2019t include co-payments, deductibles and other forms of cost-sharing once they need care.\n\nThe seemingly inexorable rise of costs has led to deep frustration with U.S. health care, prompting questions about whether a system where coverage is tied to a job can survive. As premiums and deductibles have increased in the last two decades, the percentage of workers covered has slipped as employers dropped coverage and some workers chose not to enroll. Fewer Americans under 65 had employer coverage in 2017 than in 1999, according to a separate Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of federal data. That\u2019s despite the fact that the U.S. economy employed 17 million more people in 2017 than in 1999.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve been seeing is a slow, slow kind of drip-drip erosion in employer coverage,\u201d Altman said.\n\nEmployees\u2019 costs for health care are rising more quickly than wages or overall economy-wide prices, and the working poor have been particularly hard-hit. In firms where more than 35% of employees earn less than $25,000 a year, workers would have to contribute more than $7,000 for a family health plan. It\u2019s an expense that Altman calls \u201cjust flat-out not affordable.\u201d Only one-third of employees at such firms are on their employer\u2019s health plans, compared with 63% at higher-wage firms, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s data.\n\nThe survey is based on responses from more than 2,000 randomly selected employers with at least three workers, including private firms and non-federal public employers.\n\nDeductibles are rising even faster than premiums, meaning that patients are on the hook for more of their medical costs upfront. For a single person, the average deductible in 2019 was $1,396, up from $533 in 2009. A typical household with employer health coverage spends about $800 a year in out-of-pocket costs, not counting premiums, according to research from the Commonwealth Fund. At the high end of the range, those costs can top $5,000 a year.\n\nWhile raising deductibles can moderate premiums, it also increases costs for people with an illness or who get hurt. \u201cCost-sharing is a tax on the sick,\u201d said Mark Fendrick, director of the Center for Value-Based Insurance Design at the University of Michigan.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans must cover certain preventive services such as immunizations and annual wellness visits without patient cost-sharing. But patients still have to pay out-of-pocket for other essential care, such as medication for chronic conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, until they meet their deductibles.\n\nMany Americans aren\u2019t prepared for the risks that deductibles transfer to patients. Almost 40% of adults can\u2019t pay an unexpected $400 expense without borrowing or selling an asset, according to a Federal Reserve survey from May.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem, Fendrick said. \u201cMy patient should not have to have a bake sale to afford her insulin,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter years of pushing health-care costs onto workers, some employers are pressing pause. Delta Air Lines Inc. recently froze employees\u2019 contributions to premiums for two years, Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said in an interview at Bloomberg\u2019s headquarters in New York last week.\n\n\u201cWe said we\u2019re not going to raise them. We're going to absorb the cost because we need to make certain people know that their benefits structure is real important,\u201d Bastian said. He said the company\u2019s health-care costs are growing by double-digits. The Atlanta-based company has more than 80,000 employees around the globe.\n\nStory continues", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/8/24/20831362/bellator-225-mitrione-vs-kharitonov-2-live-results-stream-discussion-play-by-play-mma-news", "authors": ["Aug"], "title": "Bellator 225: Mitrione vs. Kharitonov 2 live results, stream, discussion, play by play", "text": "Join us today (Saturday, August 24th) on Bloody Elbow for live results, discussion, round scoring and play-by-play (for the main card) as Bellator 225 Mitrione vs. Kharitonov 2 takes off from the Webster Bank Arena in Bridgeport, Connecticut.\n\nThe marquee matchup on the night will entail two of Bellator\u2019s most notable heavyweights when Matt Mitrione and Sergei Kharitonov run it back one more time.

Because you are reading a column that\u2019s being written while stuck in \u201cfast forward.\u201d\n\nIn an effort to avoid a covid-19-induced shutdown, Major League Baseball is considering playing the 2020 season exclusively in a league-wide, semi-quarantined state of existence throughout the Phoenix, Az., area.\n\nVia ESPN.com\u2019s Jeff Passan:\n\n\u201cAll 30 teams (would) play games at stadiums with no fans in the Phoenix area, including the Arizona Diamondbacks\u2019 Chase Field, 10 spring training facilities and perhaps other nearby fields. Players, coaching staffs and other essential personnel would be sequestered at local hotels, where they would live in relative isolation and travel only to and from the stadium, sources said. Federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the National Institutes of Health have been supportive of a plan that would adhere to strict isolation, promote social distancing and allow MLB to become the first professional sport to return.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s fast forward beyond all the logistical hurdles, such as effectively and repeatedly testing players to make sure they are all clean from the virus and remain that way for an extended period of time.\n\nWe\u2019ll blow by the ability to steward, cloister, and insulate all players, staffs, and broadcast personnel from exposure.\n\nForget the difficulty of trying to find a way to avoid playing games exclusively in Arizona heat in the middle of the day, maintaining the facilities and the fields, or the economics of pulling this off.\n\nWe\u2019ll ignore the concerns of so many games likely being staged for East Coast audiences with Pacific start times, or the alarms that would go off if one person got a positive test one time and how things may have to be shut down again as a result.\n\nAt some other time we can circle back to the small matter of the macroeconomics of how this would (or wouldn\u2019t) work for the players and the owners, roster sizes, or family concerns.\n\nYes. Those are the items we are going to fast forward beyond. Let\u2019s play along and assume\u2014ASSUME\u2014all those monstrous questions can be answered.\n\nLet\u2019s play some Major League Baseball under those circumstances.\n\nBut first, here are a few of the other things that, according to Passan, MLB wants to have as part of this experiment.\n\n\u2022 Implementing an electronic strike zone to allow the plate umpire to maintain sufficient distance from the catcher and batter\n\n\u2022 No mound visits from the catcher or pitching coach\n\n\u2022 Players sitting in the empty stands six feet apart \u2014 the recommended social-distancing space \u2014 instead of in a dugout\n\nWhat?! Wait. Are you kidding me?\n\nWell, except for the mound visits. I hate mound visits. Ditch them anyway. But not for this reason.\n\nSeriously. Let me get this straight. The catchers can be next to a batter. But an umpire can\u2019t be next to a catcher?\n\nNo mound visits. Got it. So does that also mean a first base coach can\u2019t talk to the base runner either? Are tag plays disallowed? How long does covid-19 live on a base? Does pine tar from batting gloves kill it?\n\nThere should probably be a new ball for every pitch, right? If an unknowingly covid-positive pitcher holds a ball and throws it and a batter hits it, is it still infected? The outfielders should probably drop every fly ball on purpose, \u201cout of an abundance of caution.\u201d\n\nYou might think I\u2019m being anal. Or sarcastic. I\u2019m not.\n\nOk. I am. But this is stupid. Either the plan allows players to be safe enough to play, or it isn\u2019t safe to play. One or the other. Make up your minds, MLB.\n\nEverything else is for show. Superficial attempts to make it look like MLB isn\u2019t pushing the envelope, being too risky, or perhaps coming back too fast. Which, obviously, would be the exact opposite of reality and what people would interpret by viewing these restrictions anyway.\n\nThis is insanity!\n\nEspecially the umpire thing. The league has been trying to get the umps out, and the mechanical strike zones in, for years now. Stop trying to hide that with painfully transparent window dressing about coronavirus safety. That\u2019s farcical.\n\nI\u2019ve got a great idea. Let\u2019s allow spit balls. But only if you doctor the ball with hand sanitizer.\n\nHmm. I bet the aloe would soften the cover of the ball too much. That\u2019ll lower homers. Scrap that idea. I retract it.\n\nLet\u2019s be honest. Commissioner Rob Manfred would be weaving in these measures for the sake of \u201coptics.\u201d God, I hate \u201coptics.\u201d Coronavirus may not kill America. But decisions based on \u201coptics\u201d might.\n\nAnd this is an example. There is no practicality to any of these ancillary measures, aside from patting yourself on the back for portraying an image of embracing #socialdistancing.\n\nLike! Retweet!\n\nIf Major League Baseball is going to proceed as if its players are safe from infection, it shouldn\u2019t simultaneously act like it is deathly afraid of exposure.\n\nHere\u2019s an image I have in my head. After nine innings of sweaty, person-to-person competition in close proximity, Josh Bell hits a walk-off homer. No celebration at home plate. He\u2019s just going to wave to his teammates in the stands, I guess.\n\nIf we are naive enough to think that this \u201cleague in a bubble\u201d idea can work, fine. Try it. We\u2019ll bring fans back into the stadium eventually, I suppose.\n\nBut these other measures are flat out absurd. Play the games. Or don\u2019t. The players are safe. Or they aren\u2019t.\n\nSave the \u201coptics\u201d for Twitter trends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTim Benz is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

In less than two months, the stock has more than doubled, closing above the $900 per-share mark and leaving most investors scrambling to figure out what's likely to come next.\n\nIn mid-February, after the share price had already risen substantially, Tesla decided to do a secondary stock offering with the idea of raising about $2 billion. Although the $767 per-share price for the offering came at a significant discount to where shares had traded immediately prior to the announcement, the electric-vehicle maker still successfully demonstrated that there was ample demand among shareholders to buy Tesla stock at lofty levels. Moreover, those investors who participated in the secondary offering have gotten a nice profit, as the stock has moved even higher.\n\nYet as profitable as the purchases have been for those new shareholders, there were some other, less obvious winners from the Tesla stock offering: the institutions that underwrote the deal. Not only did they please their customers by providing them discounted shares of the electric-car company, but they did so without bearing any risk whatsoever.\n\nWho are Tesla's underwriters?\n\nThe table below names the underwriters that participated in the offering:\n\nParent Company of Underwriter Initial Allocation of Shares Option for Additional Shares Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) 884,938 132,740 Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) 361,363 54,204 Barclays (NYSE:BCS) 333,097 49,965 Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) 192,567 28,885 Citigroup (NYSE:C) 192,567 28,885 Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) 192,567 28,885 Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) 192,567 28,885 Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) 192,567 28,885 Societe Generale 107,767 16,166\n\nThe numbers in the first column represent how many shares each underwriter was required to find buyers for. If the underwriters couldn't find someone willing to purchase those Tesla shares, then they would still be contractually obligated to buy them from Tesla and hold them for their own account.\n\nHowever, the numbers in the second column show how many extra shares underwriters could choose to buy if they wanted to. It's typical on Wall Street for underwriters to get an option to buy 15% more stock.\n\nWhat underwriters do with their overallotment option\n\nYou might think that just having that option is enough for underwriters to win every time. After all, if the stock price goes up, they can buy those extra shares at the lower offering price and get an immediate profit. If the price goes down, they just choose not to exercise the option. In that case, they don't make any extra money, but they don't lose any either.\n\nHowever, what underwriters typically do instead is to oversell shares in the offering itself. So for instance, Goldman Sachs likely sold not just its 884,938 share initial allocation, but also most or all of the optional 132,740 shares, as well. This amounts to the same exposure as short-selling a stock, but the overallotment option protects the underwriter from losses. Specifically, here are the possible scenarios:\n\nIf the share price goes up after the offering, then the underwriter is still on the hook to deliver extra shares to its clients. However, rather than paying the higher market price, the underwriter can exercise its option and obtain more shares directly from the issuing company at the offering price. The underwriter doesn't end up making any money from the stock price move, but it does earn a commission from the sale.\n\nIf the share price goes down, then the underwriter can buy cheaper shares on the open market to deliver to its clients. That creates a potential profit for the underwriter, which then can choose just to let the option expire unexercised if the stock price stays low.\n\nPay attention to stock offerings\n\nIt's tempting to think that stock offerings are all about the company that's actually selling the stock involved. However, underwriting offerings is a big business, and Wall Street companies have done a good job of negotiating favorable provisions that can make them extra money.\n\nIn Tesla's case, the soaring share price has largely hidden the no-lose opportunity that underwriters got through the electric-car company's offering.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/21/singapore-lost-control-its-coronavirus-outbreak-migrant-workers-are-victims/", "authors": ["Shibani Mahtani"], "title": "Singapore lost control of its coronavirus outbreak, and migrant workers are the victims", "text": "Shekor arrived in Singapore a decade ago at age 17, one of many low-income migrant workers who have powered the city\u2019s growth, building hospitals, subway lines and the Marina Bay Sands resort.\n\nIn his years working in aluminum production and on construction sites, the Bangladeshi national has suffered various work-related injuries.

As in Singapore, many migrant laborers are from South Asia. Elsewhere, African migrants in China are facing discrimination and xenophobia, refused entry into restaurants or evicted from their homes. Singapore\u2019s largest Chinese-language broadsheet, Lianhe Zaobao, recently published a letter from a reader who blamed the migrants for the outbreaks, labeling their countries \u201cbackward\u201d and their practices dirty.\n\nIn Singapore, critics say these events have revealed a hubris among the authorities and the wider community, who took for granted their initial success in keeping infection numbers low while failing to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak among the most downtrodden.\n\nA worker on a dormitory balcony.

Singaporean residents returning from the United States and Britain, meanwhile, were put up in four- and five-star hotels paid for by the government.\n\n\u201cThis reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they don\u2019t exist,\u201d Au said.\n\nA volunteer at the Migrant Workers Center helps organize bottles of hand sanitizer that will be distributed to the workers.\n\nHealthServe, a nonprofit providing subsidized health care to migrant workers, said migrants had been anxious as early as February about the virus and their level of risk in overcrowded living conditions. But a change in regulations meant volunteer doctors and nurses staffing the organization\u2019s nonprofit clinics could no longer serve part-time, forcing it to cut services by 90 percent.\n\n\u201cThis was a situation we felt was going to come, even if we were hoping for the best,\u201d said Suwen Low, spokeswoman for HealthServe.\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post with a news release, issued April 14, saying that authorities are working to \u201creduce the number of workers in the dormitories and also implement a medical support plan at all dormitories.\u201d\n\nWorkers in essential services have been moved out of dormitories, the ministry said, while officials were identifying alternative accommodations for others, such as army camps, sports halls, vacant housing blocks and shipping containers.\n\n\u201cOur immediate priority for the workers in the dormitories is to help them stay healthy and minimize the number that get infected,\u201d said Josephine Teo, Singapore\u2019s manpower minister, in a news conference last week.\n\nIn an address to the nation on Tuesday, Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong began by noting that the number of new cases in the local community has \u201cleveled of\" before acknowledging the problematic sharp rise in total cases overwhelmingly among migrants.\n\n\u201cWe will care for you just like we care for Singaporeans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood.\u201d\n\nHealthServe volunteers prepare to attend to patients at a clinic.

Yeo Guat Kwang, the group\u2019s chairman, said the focus should be on improving conditions in the future.\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, everyone would be wiser,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cBut this is really an unprecedented global pandemic.\u201d\n\nA second wave of coronavirus infections began taking root in Singapore in mid-March, similar to other places in Asia, like Hong Kong and Taiwan, as residents abroad flocked back to the region when outbreaks intensified in Europe and the United States. But while Hong Kong managed this spike, getting new cases down to single-digits for more than eight days straight, and Taiwan recorded several days this month with no new cases, Singapore now has among the highest number of cases per capita globally.\n\nThe migrant workers bearing the brunt of the outbreak are overwhelmingly male and employed in construction and other labor-intensive sectors that Singaporeans avoid. The typical construction worker in Singapore earns about $430 a month, while the median monthly income for Singaporeans is $3,227.\n\nThis field is usually crowded with migrant workers enjoying a day off.\n\n\u201cTo keep them cheap, we have to exploit,\u201d said Au from TWC2. \u201cWe pack them into [trucks], we pack them into dormitories, and now, when a crisis hits, they have no buffer.\u201d\n\nClusters have been identified in many dormitories. More than a dozen dormitories have been placed under quarantine, meaning workers cannot leave their rooms, while nearly all dormitory residents are now barred from leaving the facilities, which are guarded by police.\n\nThe more than 200,000 dormitory residents are now anxious, bored, isolated and scared.

He was given an \u201cadvisory for patients with respiratory tract infection\u201d \u2014 a status that means he has to isolate himself from others or be fined $7,000.\n\nThat was impossible in his 12-person room, he said. Ali\u2019s cough persisted, but under lockdown, he was unable to seek medical attention for several days.\n\n\u201cWho will give me any treatment or help?\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI am so scared I will die before any help comes.\u201d\n\nAuthorities say that infected dormitory residents have been linked through common work sites, and through places like shopping malls, where many gather on their days off. In the dormitories, before the lockdown, men were able to socialize with each other and cook together, a distraction from their physically demanding jobs and the difficulty of being away from their families.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Ali said he was finally able to see a doctor, who gave him cough syrup and tested him for the coronavirus.

They only us serology testing which looks for antibodies but because I was on steroids at the time I was bitten and couldn\u2019t produce antibodies so they discarded the possibility of Lyme.\n\n\u201cSince then I\u2019ve had diagnoses from three different professionals in Germany, America and Ireland.\n\n\u201cAnd to my shock I didn\u2019t have just one strain of Lyme like most people, I had four. I had been bitten and infected with Lyme at least three times.\n\n\u201cI tested positive for your strains of Lyme and seven infections caused by Lyme.\n\n\"Two were from America, probably picked up when I was in Connecticut in 1993.\n\n\"And one was from Europe, which was probably during a backpacking trip in the Greek islands when I was bitten by lots of insects.\n\n(Image: Joanne Baskett)\n\n\u201cIt has ruined by life.

Sometimes I can\u2019t stand up or even hold anything.\n\n\u201cIf I had been diagnosed earlier it would certainly have stopped my illness progressing to the stage it\u2019s at now, which is total bowel paralysis, stomach paralysis and bladder paralysis.\n\n\"Slowly but surely my organs are failing on me, and it\u2019s frightening.\n\n\u201cI feel absolutely devastated. Angry isn\u2019t the right word, I would say heartbroken, that my whole life didn\u2019t turn out the way I expected it to, and all because of a tick.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to me.

But I never knew they could spread disease, I was totally unaware about that.\n\n\u201cWhile I was trimming the hedge I found one on my right lower leg.\n\n\"I used to tick tool to get it out but it was quite a small one and quite tricky to remove. A few days later I had a rash around where I had been bitten.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t until six weeks later that I began to feel really fluey and not myself.\n\n\"My throat was swollen, I had ear ache and heavy legs, and I was getting hot and cold chills.\u201d\n\n(Image: Joanne Baskett)\n\nJoanne\u2019s health quickly went downhill, until the point where she was no longer able to get out of bed.\n\nAnd her long-term partner left her just a year after her symptoms started, leaving her to look after her three young children alone.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe disease quickly affected my whole body. I cannot eat because my stomach is paralysed, and my bowels don\u2019t empty without machinery because that\u2019s paralysed too.\n\n\u201cMy cognition is very poor so often I can\u2019t think or speak properly. I can\u2019t walk.\n\n\u201cAt first my GP said I had fibromyalgia and ME/CFS. I believed that to start with.\n\n\u201cThen a friend told me that a bullseye rash means you have Lyme, and I started to research it. I began to realise that what I had were the symptoms and not the actually illness.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I went to a specialist clinic in the States and they found I had four types of Lyme disease.

David Ryder/Getty Images\n\nFederal, state, and local officials did not mince words at a press conference today on COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that has infected a confirmed 39 patients in Washington state, including 10 deaths.\n\nThe message: Stay home if you are sick or over 60.\n\nKing County Executive Dow Constantine said that the county is asking all employees who can telecommute to work from home and is canceling all non-essential meetings for the next three weeks. The county is also suggesting all community groups to cancel or postpone large gatherings or meetings with more than 10 people. This is to protect the elderly, those with compromised immune systems, and pregnant women, according to Constantine.\n\nHe also said the city is still in the process of finding a location to quarantine and treat those who have been infected with the virus. They are focusing on a location in White Center because the county already owns the land and it has access to utilities.\n\nFour of the deaths attributed to COVID-19 originated at Life Care, a nursing home in King County, where 50 people are reportedly being tested. A CDC official, who was also at the press conference, said they have sent physicians to the facility to help with diagnosis and treatment, but they are not encouraging residents to leave the facility at this time.\n\nSeattle & King County Public Health Director Patty Hayes spoke about the stress to the healthcare system and noted that while 80 percent of people who contract the virus will have mild symptoms, there is no treatment and so large numbers of people showing up to ERs or doctors offices for testing will only add more stress to the already over-burdened system.\n\nAs for schools, Hayes says they are not encouraging schools to close at this time unless a student or staff member has been diagnosed with the virus. The reason for this, she said, is that children have not been shown to be a high-risk group, and if kids aren't in school, they will just go someplace else. All school closures, she added, should be decided by local schools and school systems.\n\nMore tests are expected to be available in the coming days and weeks, according to Kathy Lofi from the state Public Health Department, but there is currently only one facility operating in the Puget Sound region with the ability to process lab results, and that lab is only able to test 100 patients a day. UW will have a similar capacity up and running soon, and the state has asked labs across the state to be prepared to process coronavirus tests as well.

On to our weekly three quick topics:\n\nI Know\u2026 Ezekiel Elliott essentially summed up the state of the season moments after the loss to Philly.\n\nThe Pro Bowl running back was asked about the emotions of losing to a team, on paper, they should beat.\n\n\u201cHow can you say we\u2019re a better team if we didn't go out there and beat them?\u201d Elliott replied. \u201cWhen it was time to do it in the crunch time, we needed one win to solidify the division and we couldn't do it.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just say that we\u2019re a better team because we may have better players on the roster. I do believe we\u2019re a better team, but the team that goes out there and plays the best is the one that\u2019s going to win. And that\u2019s what happened (Sunday).\u201d\n\nYou can count on Elliott to give candid, level-headed assessments of where the team is after wins or losses. Bottom line, the Cowboys have talent but not the wins to show for it. They haven\u2019t won the close games they won last year: 1-6 in games decided by one score or less, including the eight-point loss to the Eagles. Last year they were 9-3 in those games.\n\nAnd, with the exception of two or three games (including Week 15 against the Rams, the polar opposite of Week 16 against the Eagles) they haven\u2019t played consistent complementary football. Haven\u2019t picked each other up often enough when one or two units struggled.\n\nThat has been the difference. And, as Elliott said, the scoreboard is the only thing that matters.\n\nThat\u2019s why they need a win, plus help, to keep their season going.\n\nI Think\u2026 if you need a little holiday pick-me-up, take a look at Michael Gallup\u2019s second season.\n\nYes, the 17-9 loss to Philly is the overarching, and disappointing, takeaway from last Sunday. But the 23-year-old Gallup did top 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his young career, joining Amari Cooper as only the seventh 1,000-yard receiving duo in team history and the first since 2012.\n\nGallup leads the offense with 16 catches of at least 20 yards, one more than Cooper\u2019s 15. He has an explosive catch in eight of his 13 starts this season, having missed two games in September following a knee scope. He provided one of just two explosive plays against the Eagles, a 41-yard catch that led to a field goal.\n\nAnd he was inches away from another one \u2013 a potential game-tying touchdown against Philly in the final two minutes.\n\nDrops have been an issue at times for the Cowboys\u2019 receivers. But, in a challenging season that technically still has playoff possibilities, Gallup has been a bright spot. He\u2019s a stronger, more explosive, more consistent player now than a year ago.\n\nI Have No Idea \u2026 how to explain the difference between Amari Cooper\u2019s numbers, home and road.\n\nAs David Helman wrote last week, Cooper has basically doubled his catch total at AT&T Stadium compared to the road (now 48 to 27). Cooper has perused the numbers, too, noting a couple weeks ago that his targets have been lower in road games.\n\n(Not a complaint from Cooper, just an observation. He added that he\u2019s not one to demand a certain number of throws his way because he believes in the offense\u2019s overall talent.)\n\nCooper has battled through a variety of nagging lower body injuries since August. But it\u2019s not affecting his ability to practice or play. He wasn\u2019t on the injury report last week and said after the game that his health is fine. He said he simply played \u201cterrible\u201d against the Eagles, catching only 4 passes on 12 targets with the longest gain 6 yards.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1607604514", "authors": ["Dec"], "title": "Samsung's first 'home ready' microLED TV is a 110\" model", "text": "Samsung will launch a 110-inch microLED TV in the first quarter of 2021. A new production method will make it possible to produce smaller displays in the future, the company said. Smaller microLED TVs in the future At CES 2018, Samsung unveiled \u2018The Wall\u2019, its module-based TV based on a new microLED display technology. At CES 2020, the company announced that it intended to launch the first \u2018home ready\u2019 microLED TVs in 2020. Those plans were slightly delayed and Samsung now says that it will launch the first such microLED TV in the first quarter of 2021. It is a 110-inch microLED TV that has been prefabricated, meaning that it is no longer module-bound. Samsung says that it is \u201cdelivering the MicroLED experience in a traditional TV form for the first time\u201d. The company also said that its new mass production method will make possible smaller microLED TVs in the future, but without providing a timeline. - \"Previously, mass-producing a MicroLED screen as small as 110\u2019\u2019 for simple home installation wasn\u2019t possible. But Samsung innovated to make it a reality by developing cutting-edge surface mount technology \u2014 along with a new production process derived from its semiconductor business \u2014 making MicroLED technology easier to manufacture, deliver, and install. These same innovations will allow Samsung to produce even smaller MicroLED models in the future, so even more consumers can enjoy the breathtaking MicroLED experience,\" the company said. Like OLED, microLED is self-emissive. It means that each pixel is its own light source so it can control brightness and color on the pixel-level for more accurate and better picture quality, especially in HDR. There is no need for a backlight module like the company's \u201cQLED\u201d LCD TVs. Samsung's microLED does not rely on color filters either. The 110-inch TV has 4K resolution, 100% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, and is powered by a new \u2018Micro AI Processor\u2019. - \"As consumers rely on their televisions for more functions than ever, we are incredibly excited to bring the 110\u201d MicroLED to the commercial market,\" said Jonghee Han, President of Visual Display Business, Samsung Electronics. \"Samsung MicroLED is going to redefine what premium at-home experiences mean for consumers around the world.\" The company added that its microLED technology has \u201ca lifespan of up to 100,000 hours, or over a decade\u201d. The small light emitting diodes are, unlike OLEDs, made from inorganic materials. The screen has a 99.99% screen-to-body ratio and is virtually borderless. A multi-view feature lets the viewer watch up to four sources of content at the same time - each in 55 inches. There is an embedded 5.1 sound system too. Samsung has been teasing microLED TVs for years but it remains a technology for the rich and famous. The module-based approach was not fit for typical living rooms but there is hope that the new fabrication method can move things in the right direction. Still, the company declined to provide pricing details. Expect it to be wildly expensive. And a 110-inch model is not exactly what Samsung promised for 2020 either.

It was the type of situation that had spelled recent trouble for the 30-year-old left-hander, but he crucially managed to navigate the jam and emerge unscathed.\n\nPomeranz cruised after that, striking out seven over five scoreless innings to help the Giants topple Clayton Kershaw and the first-place Dodgers, 2-1, in the series opener at Oracle Park. It was a much-needed rebound for Pomeranz, whose rotation spot had appeared increasingly tenuous after he went 0-4 with a 15.70 ERA over his previous five starts.\n\n\u2022 Box score\n\n\u201cWhat a great job keeping his poise in that first inning,\u201d manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cWith the way things have gone, it probably put a little added pressure on him, but he made the pitches there to get out of that inning. To me, that was the ballgame there.\u201d\n\nA week ago, there was some doubt as to whether Pomeranz would get another start with the Giants. His struggles culminated in a disastrous start against the last-place Orioles on May 31, when he surrendered eight runs over 1 2/3 innings in the shortest outing of his career. Still, the Giants decided to stick with Pomeranz, pushing his next start back to give him extra time to work between outings and to line him up against the Dodgers, whose lineup skews left-handed.\n\nSeeking an adjustment, Pomeranz used the break to work on raising his arm slot and getting on top of the ball better.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve been on the side of [the ball] a little bit in the past couple years and some this year,\u201d Pomeranz said. \u201cIt just makes everything flatten out. I hadn\u2019t really been getting the swings I wanted to on some stuff, so I worked really hard on just committing to staying on top of the ball.\u201d\n\nPomeranz opened his start by striking out Chris Taylor, but he then yielded back-to-back singles to Max Muncy and Justin Turner. That brought up Cody Bellinger, who worked a walk to load the bases for David Freese. But Pomeranz prevented the situation from spiraling, striking out Freese and Corey Seager to get through the 30-pitch inning without allowing any damage.\n\n\u201cI think confidence is huge,\u201d Pomeranz said. \u201cGetting out of that first inning, when it seems like everything is not going your way and you start wiggling out of those jams, it\u2019s huge for you as a pitcher. Instead of feeling like you\u2019re not getting out of anything, you start rolling with those situations and focusing on one pitch at a time.\u201d\n\nPomeranz went on to retire 14 of the final 15 batters he faced, yielding only a two-out single to Seager in the fourth. He departed after allowing three hits -- all singles -- and throwing 92 pitches. It marked his best start since he tossed six scoreless innings against the Blue Jays on April 24.\n\n\u201cI think, no question, it was key for him to have a good outing today,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cI don\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve been pitching or how long you\u2019ve been playing, you still need a little success, because it\u2019s all built on confidence. Hitting, pitching, it\u2019s how you feel and what you believe. He put together a nice game, so this should do a lot for him.\u201d\n\nThe Giants made sure Pomeranz\u2019s effort didn\u2019t go to waste.\n\nAfter being shut out by Kershaw through the first five innings, the Giants managed to scratch a pair of runs across in the sixth. They caught a break after Chris Taylor tripped over a bullpen mound in left field while attempting to chase down a fly ball off the bat of Brandon Belt, who then drew a leadoff walk to spark the rally. It was only Belt\u2019s fourth walk against Kershaw, who has held the Giants\u2019 first baseman to a .071 (4-for-56) batting average over his career.\n\nBelt advanced to second on a single by Evan Longoria before scoring on Kevin Pillar\u2019s base hit to left field to put the Giants on the board. The Dodgers played their infield in against Brandon Crawford in hopes of keeping the Giants from extending their lead, but Crawford bounced a grounder to second baseman Max Muncy, allowing Longoria to race home from third and beat Muncy\u2019s throw to the plate.\n\nTaylor homered off Tony Watson to bring the Dodgers within one in the eighth, but closer Will Smith worked a scoreless ninth to shut the door for the Giants, who handed Kershaw his first loss in 22 starts.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing was the intensity level was raised during this game,\u201d Belt said. \u201cWe need to take that into series against teams who aren\u2019t the best teams in the league, and if we can do that, we can win a lot more ballgames.\u201d", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.secondcityhockey.com/2020/7/15/21326569/malcolm-subban-ready-to-play-corey-crawford-unfit-to-play-chicago-blackhawks-vs-edmonton-oilers-nhl", "authors": ["Brandon M.

The Packers missed out on any opportunity to sign Robby Anderson, Austin Hooper, or Emmanuel Sanders in free agency as they devoted what little resources they had elsewhere.\n\nThe Packers have made a couple of head-scratching moves to this point in the offseason, signing Christian Kirksey and Ricky Wagner. Both are solid contributors but are not exactly upgrades from the players departing town at linebacker and tackle. Having made two signings that don\u2019t really move the needle, it stripped the Packers of any opportunity to sign a player who would make a true impact at the position.\n\nFunchess is coming off a very disappointing season with the Colts after he signed a one-year \u201cprove it\u201d deal worth $10 million. Funchess played in just one game last season before going on injured reserve with a broken collarbone. While both sides appeared to need each other, and the Packers might be getting a motivated player playing for a big contract, the signing is very yawn-inducing for a team in such dire need of pass catchers.\n\nIt also shows a bizarre lack of faith in Allen Lazard, who is notably a similar type of wide receiver to Funchess. Right now, the Packers have 6-foot-1 Davante Adams, 6-foot-4 Devin Funchess, and 6-foot-5 Lazard. Further down the depth chart are 6-foot-4 Marquez Valdes-Scantling and 6-foot-5 Equanimeous St. Brown. What is still missing, and has been for years, is a true speedster who can win the underneath matchups.\n\nFurthermore, the Packers have nothing to be confident in at tight end. Jace Sternberger and Marcedes Lewis is arguably the worst tight end group in football, unless Sternberger makes a huge second-year jump.\n\nThe Packers desperately need to target Henry Ruggs III, K.J.

Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania have found a new method for attacking MYC by targeting a protein that they believe is the oncogene\u2019s Achilles' heel.\n\nBlocking the protein, called ATF4, causes cancer cells to make too much of another type of protein family called 4E-BP. That causes the cancer cells so much stress that they die. The researchers believe that the discovery, published in the journal Nature Cell Biology, could spark new ideas for cancer therapeutics, because experimental compounds that block the synthesis of ATF4 have already been developed.\n\nIn normal cells, MYC controls growth. But mutations can cause the gene to malfunction, producing the uncontrollable cell growth that drives cancer. The lead author of the new study, Constantinos Koumenis, Ph.D., Penn professor of radiation oncology, and colleagues previously found that an enzyme called PERK activates ATF4.\n\nFREE DAILY NEWSLETTER Like this story?

So they decided to go \u201cfurther downstream to block tumor growth in a way that cancer cells can't easily escape,\u201d said Koumenis in a statement.\n\nRELATED: Scientists find a possible new target for metastatic prostate cancer\n\nUsing mouse models of lymphoma and colorectal cancer, the Penn researchers removed ATF4 from cells. The tumor cells responded by overproducing 4E-BP proteins. That caused tumors to stop growing in the animal models.\n\nIn further lab tests using human tumor samples, the researchers found that when cancer is driven by MYC, both ATF4 and 4E-BP are overexpressed\u2014a signal, they believe, that blocking ATF4 could work in people.\n\nThe study comes just a couple of months after a team from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposed a different way to target MYC-driven cancers. They found that deleting the protein PHLPP2 in mouse-derived cancer cells reduces levels of MYC. When they knocked out the PHLPP2 gene in mouse models of prostate cancer, they were able to slow the spread of the cancer.\n\nDespite the challenges inherent in directly targeting MYC, some biotech startups are still pursuing the strategy. Aptos Biosciences, for example, is conducting early-stage human trials of its MYC inhibitor, APTO-253. The program hit a major snag in 2015, when the FDA slapped a clinical hold on it due to manufacturing issues. That hold was lifted a year ago.\n\nKoumenis\u2019 team at Penn favors the indirect approach to attacking MYC that they described in the new study, and the researchers are planning to continue to investigate how ATF4 works in MYC-dependent tumors. They are also planning studies designed to determine whether blocking ATF4 could cause off-target side effects in people.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/16/weekly-jobless-claims.html", "authors": ["Terri Cullen", "In Terricullen"], "title": "US weekly jobless claims drop unexpectedly", "text": "Job seekers attend the CUNY Big Apple Job and Internship Fair at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in New York.\n\nThe number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped for a fifth straight week last week, indicating the labor market remained strong despite a recent slowdown in job growth.\n\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Jan. 11, the Labor Department said on Thursday.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would rise slightly to 216,000 in the latest week from the unrevised 214,000 reported for the previous week.\n\nThe U.S. dollar pared losses against a basket of currencies and U.S. stock index futures held gains after the release of the data.

Either way, the fact that it exists at all, and that Sony TV and Netflix were willing to put money behind what is so obviously an extremely niche passion project, feels like a good omen for franchise TV.\"\n\nRead next: Breaking Bad Creator Reveals El Camino Alternate Endings, Breaking Bad Creator Reveals El Camino Alternate Endings", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Wed Oct 23 16:56:08 +0000 2019", "id": 1187050081645580288, "id_str": "1187050081645580288", "full_text": "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie was watched by 25,734,392 households in its first seven days https://t.co/FDyPlYc8YO", "truncated": false, "display_text_range": [0, 92], "entities": {"hashtags": [], "symbols": [], "user_mentions": [], "urls": [], "media": [{"id": 1187049925797793793, "id_str": "1187049925797793793", "indices": [93, 116], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHk_nkXU0AEfSj4.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHk_nkXU0AEfSj4.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/FDyPlYc8YO", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/FDyPlYc8YO", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1187050081645580288/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "small": {"w": 680, "h": 453, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 2000, "h": 1333, "resize": "fit"}, "medium": {"w": 1200, "h": 800, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "extended_entities": {"media": [{"id": 1187049925797793793, "id_str": "1187049925797793793", "indices": [93, 116], "media_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHk_nkXU0AEfSj4.jpg", "media_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EHk_nkXU0AEfSj4.jpg", "url": "https://t.co/FDyPlYc8YO", "display_url": "pic.twitter.com/FDyPlYc8YO", "expanded_url": "https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1187050081645580288/photo/1", "type": "photo", "sizes": {"thumb": {"w": 150, "h": 150, "resize": "crop"}, "small": {"w": 680, "h": 453, "resize": "fit"}, "large": {"w": 2000, "h": 1333, "resize": "fit"}, "medium": {"w": 1200, "h": 800, "resize": "fit"}}}]}, "source": "<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>", "in_reply_to_status_id": null, "in_reply_to_status_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_user_id": null, "in_reply_to_user_id_str": null, "in_reply_to_screen_name": null, "user": {"id": 16573941, "id_str": "16573941", "name": "Netflix US", "screen_name": "netflix", "location": "California, USA", "description": "Paul Rudd + Paul Rudd + Paul Rudd + Paul Rudd + Paul Rudd + Paul Rudd", "url": "https://t.co/T5SVny1urw", "entities": {"url": {"urls": [{"url": "https://t.co/T5SVny1urw", "expanded_url": "https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/81183739", "display_url": "netflix.com/browse/genre/8\u2026", "indices": [0, 23]}]}, "description": {"urls": []}}, "protected": false, "followers_count": 6796184, "friends_count": 1289, "listed_count": 17262, "created_at": "Fri Oct 03 04:16:17 +0000 2008", "favourites_count": 15134, "utc_offset": null, "time_zone": null, "geo_enabled": true, "verified": true, "statuses_count": 30263, "lang": null, "contributors_enabled": false, "is_translator": false, "is_translation_enabled": false, "profile_background_color": "C0DEED", "profile_background_image_url": "http://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_image_url_https": "https://abs.twimg.com/images/themes/theme1/bg.png", "profile_background_tile": false, "profile_image_url": "http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1089957236221329409/rsMZ82D3_normal.jpg", "profile_image_url_https": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1089957236221329409/rsMZ82D3_normal.jpg", "profile_banner_url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_banners/16573941/1571409420", "profile_link_color": "E50914", "profile_sidebar_border_color": "FFFFFF", "profile_sidebar_fill_color": "DDEEF6", "profile_text_color": "333333", "profile_use_background_image": false, "has_extended_profile": false, "default_profile": false, "default_profile_image": false, "following": null, "follow_request_sent": null, "notifications": null, "translator_type": "none"}, "geo": null, "coordinates": null, "place": null, "contributors": null, "is_quote_status": false, "retweet_count": 2972, "favorite_count": 24669, "favorited": false, "retweeted": false, "possibly_sensitive": false, "lang": "en"}], "spans": [[401, 517]]}, {"url": "https://www.wptv.com/news/world/greenland-lost-2-billion-tons-of-ice-yesterday-which-is-very-unusual", "authors": [], "title": "Greenland lost 2 billion tons of ice yesterday, which is very unusual", "text": "(CNN) -- Over 40% of Greenland experienced melting yesterday, with total ice loss estimated to be more than 2 gigatons (a gigaton is equal to 1 billion tons).\n\nWhile Greenland is a big island filled with lots of ice, it is highly unusual for that much ice to be lost in the middle of June. The average \"melt season\" for Greenland runs from June to August, with the bulk of the melting occurring in July.\n\nTo visualize how much ice that is, imagine filling the National Mall in Washington DC with enough ice to reach a point in the sky eight times higher than the Washington Monument (to borrow an analogy Meredith Nettles from Columbia University gave to the Washington Post.)\n\nThe sudden spike in melting \"is unusual, but not unprecedented,\" according to Thomas Mote, a research scientist at the University of Georgia who studies Greenland's climate.\n\n\"It is comparable to some spikes we saw in June of 2012,\" Mote told CNN, referring to the record-setting melt year of 2012 that saw almost the entire ice sheet experience melting for the first time in recorded history.\n\nThis much melting this early in the summer could be a bad sign, indicating 2019 could once again set records for the amount of Greenland ice loss.\n\nMote explained how snow and ice melt off the Greenland ice sheet, especially early in the season, makes it easier to for additional melt to occur later in the summer.\n\nWhite snow and ice, which is bright and reflects the sun's rays back into space, reduces the amount of heat that is absorbed and helps to keep the ice sheet cold (a process known as \"albedo\").\n\n\"These melt events events result in a changed surface albedo,\" according to Mote, which will allow more of the mid-summer sun's heat to be absorbed into the ice and melt it.\n\nPredictions for a record melt season\n\nAccording to Mote \"all signs seem to be pointing to a large melt season,\" and he is far from the only scientist to think so.\n\nJason Box, an ice climatologist at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, predicted in late May that \"2019 will be a big melt year for Greenland.\"\n\nBox pointed out that this year had unusually early season melt days in April, and the melt season was \"happening about three weeks earlier than average, and earlier than the record-setting melt year of 2012.\"\n\nIn addition to the early season melt, the snow cover is already lower than average in Western Greenland, and combining these factors \"mean that 2019 is likely going to be a very big melt year, and even the potential to exceed the record melt year of 2012.\"\n\nWhat is causing the sudden melt?\n\nA persistent weather pattern has been setting the stage for the current spike in melting, according to Mote.\n\n\"We've had a blocking ridge that has been anchored over East Greenland throughout much of the spring, which led to some melting activity in April -- and that pattern has persisted.\"\n\nThat high pressure ridge pulls up warm, humid air from the Central Atlantic into portions of Greenland which leads to warmer temperatures over the ice. The high pressure also prevents precipitation from forming and leads to clear, sunny skies.\n\nOver the past week or two, that high pressure ridge got even stronger as another high pressure front moved in from the eastern U.S. (the one that caused the prolonged hot and dry period in the Southeast earlier this month).\n\nMelt periods like the current one are not unprecedented; Mote noted previous ones in 2012 as well as 2007 and 2010 (all major melt years). But he pointed out that until recently, they were unheard of.\n\n\"We've seen a sequence of these large melt seasons, starting in 2007, that would have been unprecedented earlier in the record,\" and according to Mote \"we didn't see anything like this prior to the late 1990's.\"\n\nIf these extreme melt seasons are becoming the new normal, it could have significant ramifications around the globe, especially for sea level rise.\n\n\"Greenland has been an increasing contributor to global sea level rise over the past two decades,\" Mote said, \"and surface melting and runoff is a large portion of that.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The Oscar-winning director met Daniella, who is the daughter of Israeli singer and songwriter Tzvika Pick, in 2009 amid his press tour for Inglourious Basterds. The pair got engaged in June 2017, after dating for about a year. According to People magazine, the couple's engagement party served as a Pulp Fiction cast reunion, with a guest list including Bruce Willis, Samuel L.

Tarantino previously dated costume designer Courtney Hoffman. In a 2009 interview with GQ, Tarantino explained why he has never married or had children: \"When I\u2019m doing a movie, I\u2019m not doing anything else. It\u2019s all about the movie.

No other driver/crew chief combination in the Cup playoffs has as wide of an age gap as Chad Knaus and William Byron at 27 years.\n\nAnd no other combination in the playoffs has as many championships. Of course, Knaus won seven titles with Jimmie Johnson and Byron makes his Cup playoff debut Sunday at Las Vegas Motor Speedway (7 p.m. ET, NBCSN).\n\nWhile Joe Gibbs Racing (just pick a driver) is the favorite to win the title, Kevin Harvick is the hottest driver and Joey Logano seeks a second consecutive championship, one of the most intriguing storylines of the postseason could be Knaus and Byron.\n\nThey\u2019ve spent their first season together learning and adjusting to each other. The result has been significant gains at times.\n\n\u201cI feel like the first 10 races were kind of that newness and awkward stage of a relationship in trying to figure out how not to step on each other\u2019s toes,\u201d Byron said Thursday during playoff media day at South Point Hotel Casino. \u201cAnd there were some heated moments, to be honest. We had some things that we didn\u2019t execute as well as we wanted to. And then we got to the meat of the season in the summer, and we just started to really click.\u201d\n\nAs that relationship progressed, Byron also hit a key milestone in the All-Star Race in May. He raced his way into the All-Star Race with an aggressive style.\n\n\u201cIt was, at least for me, a turning point because it gave me the confidence that I could do it,\u201d Byron said.\n\nBut Byron doesn\u2019t mean aggressive in the sense of knocking people out of the way. Instead, he was aggressive in how he contemplated his next move on the track.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of anticipating what moves to make,\u201d Byron said. \u201cYou\u2019re taking advantage of situations more than you are defending situations, and I think that was a big difference. Coming to a restart and thinking about how can I take advantage of this person or this person or get the best start that I can. That\u2019s what changed for me in that race.\u201d\n\nWhile Byron has continued to learn, he\u2019s also made an impact on Knaus in at least one way.\n\n\u201cAs far as me shaping him, I think the only thing is just staying positive and staying motivated in the race,\u201d Byron said. \u201cI don\u2019t seem to do well with like negative energy.\u201d\n\nHow did he get his point across?\n\n\u201cI think situations have played out on the track to where it\u2019s kind of been understood that we\u2019ve got to do things a different way,\u201d Byron said. \u201cWe both have our way of doing things. I\u2019ve really accepted the way he does things, and he\u2019s accepted the way I do things. Any good working relationship is kind of that compromise.\u201d\n\nHe admits one key learning point came at Watkins Glen when Knaus all but ordered Byron to hit Kyle Busch\u2019s car in retaliation for earlier contact. Busch slammed his brakes and that created a greater impact when Byron ran into the back of Busch\u2019s car. The result was Byron damaged his car more than Busch\u2019s was hurt.\n\n\u201cI think it was a turning point for us because I realized I\u2019m the guy driving the car and ultimately the decisions that I make affect what I do,\u201d Byron said. \u201cObviously, that trickles down to my team and all the work they\u2019re putting in.\u201d\n\n2. Way in the past\n\nIt is nearing 10 years since Denny Hamlin was in position to win the championship only to see mistakes and misfortune rob him of that opportunity.\n\nThe Joe Gibbs Racing driver still seeks his first Cup crown.\n\nHamlin, who won this year\u2019s Daytona 500, is confident entering the playoffs after a season with four victories, including two in the last six races.\n\nBut until he wins a championship, that 2010 title race will remain something he\u2019s asked about. He entered that season finale in Miami with a slim points lead after he gave away several points by pitting for fuel late in the season\u2019s penultimate race in Phoenix. In Miami, Hamlin faltered during the weekend and Jimmie Johnson won his fifth consecutive title.\n\n\u201cI just got too excited in the moment,\u201d Hamlin said Thursday. \u201cI remember when it all started on qualifying day. Watching a couple guys run up high in qualifying and be fast, I\u2019m like, \u2018I didn\u2019t practice up there (but) I need to run up there.\u2019 I got in the wall and started in the rear and caught up in a three-wide wreck early (in the race). That was on the driver, not anyone else in 2010.\u201d\n\nBut he admits it took some time before he could move on from that experience.\n\n\u201cI came off an eight-win season in 2010 and in 2011 I won one race and just kind of ran crappy,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cIt was definitely a hangover, letdown year from 2010. Then we kind of bounced back in 2012 (with five wins). \u2026 We had a good season and at that point I kind of let 2010 go.\u201d\n\nAs for now, Hamlin is eager for the playoffs to begin. He won at Pocono in late July and followed that with a third-place finish at Watkins Glen, a runner-up result at Michigan, a win at Bristol, a 29th-place finish at Darlington after he was collected in a crash, and a sixth-place finish in a backup car last weekend at Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cWe are not searching for speed, we are not searching for anything right now,\u201d Hamlin said. \u201cAs long as we execute, we contend for wins every week and that is something that only a handful or less can say every week.\u201d\n\nHamlin also likes that the series is heading back to several tracks for a second time this season. He notes that in the second time to tracks this season, he has finished first at Pocono, second at Michigan and first at Bristol.\n\n3. Higher expectations\n\nRyan Blaney is in the playoffs for a third consecutive year, but he enters still seeking his first victory of the season, while teammates Brad Keselowski (three) and Joey Logano (two) each have multiple wins this year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to be doing better,\u201d said Blaney, who has five top-10 finishes in the last seven races. \u201cYou want to be winning races with your teammates, right? I mean, your teammates winning races, you want to win races and you know, it sucks that we haven\u2019t won a race yet this year. There\u2019s a handful of them I wish we got back, but you just try to move forward and move on and try to do the best you can.\n\n\u201cIndy stunk how it kind of played out and ended there. But you definitely want to be doing better. Do I think that I\u2019ve done the best job throughout this year and before this? No, I could do a lot better. So that\u2019s kind of an \u2018on me\u2019 thing. So you just try to keep learning, keep getting better.\n\n\u201cYou see your teammates winning and you want to be there just to prove that. You want to be part of the show. You want to be in that group. You want to be in that winning group, and hopefully we can figure things out.\u201d\n\nBlaney says when he compares himself to Keselowski and Logano, \u201cI feel like I don\u2019t meet expectations. So that part stinks.\n\n\u201cI think Brad and Joey are two of the best guys out here, smartest guys, really great race car drivers and do a great job of figuring it out. And you just try to compare yourself to those guys. It\u2019s hard compared to them because they\u2019re so good and past champions. But I think if you try to meet that bar, and you kind of push yourself to be there, hopefully one day you do achieve that goal and get to where those guys are at.\u201d\n\n4. How many wins could Kyle Busch have?\n\nAsked if he is better with handling frustration, regular-season champion Kyle Busch answered by alluding to this season and the four wins he has.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m definitely not very good with frustrating moments,\u201d said Busch, winless in his last 12 races. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. You pour your life and soul into this and this is what you do and what you want to do and be successful at, and you want to go out here and prove and show people what they all hype up and talk about that, yes it\u2019s true that I can be one of the best here and it\u2019s frustrating when I\u2019m not able to come out of races or seasons with the goals that you anticipate or the goals that you think you can achieve.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite frustrating in that regard. This year for example, we\u2019ve had four wins. We\u2019ve been really good, we led the points \u2026 you look back on it and we should have eight or nine wins.\u201d\n\n5. New mayor for Nashville\n\nJohn Cooper defeated Mayor David Briley by more than a two-to-one margin Thursday to become the new mayor of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nHere is why that matters to NASCAR fans:\n\nOnce Cooper takes office (at a date to be determined) one of the many issues he\u2019ll be tasked with is the effort by officials from Bristol Motor Speedway and Speedway Motorsports Inc. to renovate Fairgrounds Speedway in hopes of attracting a NASCAR race.\n\nWith NASCAR seeking to announce the 2021 schedule around April 1, 2020, it leaves a little more than six months for Bristol officials to have an agreement with the mayor, get approval from the metro council and get approval from the fair board to begin construction on what has been billed as a $60 million project.\n\nIt would seem ambitious to think everything could be put into place for Nashville to be on the 2021 NASCAR schedule. If so, that could mean that the earliest NASCAR might race there would be 2022.\n\nFollow @dustinlong and on Facebook", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9414892/neil-young-scathing-letter-president-trump-looking-for-a-leader-2020-song", "authors": ["Heran Mamo"], "title": "Neil Young Won't Sue Trump for Playing His Music at Rallies, So He Rewrote 'Looking For a Leader'", "text": "Neil Young sounded off on President Donald Trump yesterday (July 6) in one of his signature scathing letters after Trump used his music at another one of his rallies.

The Canadian-born singer-songwriter, who officially became an American citizen at the beginning of 2020, originally wrote the political tune when former President Barack Obama announced his first presidential run ahead of the 2008 election against then-President George W.

According to the Financial Times, the deal is as good as done and could be announced as soon as Monday. The transaction with current owner SoftBank said to be worth at US$40 billion, around US$8 billion more than SoftBank acquired Arm for back in 2016.\n\nArm was established as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple and VLSI Technology in 1990 to develop reduced instruction set computer (RISC) chips. Apple eventually sold out of the business in around 1998 the proceeds of which helped to save the company from insolvency. Apple of course used a Samsung-made Arm-based chip to power the original iPhone before eventually acquiring an Arm license to customize Arm\u2019s architecture in its own chips. Other key makers of mobile Arm chips include Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung, and until recently, Huawei.\n\nNvidia had previously made brief foray into designing Arm-based chips for smartphones with its Tegra brand which integrated its own GPU architecture. It stepped back from those efforts and redirected its energy into developing Arm-based platforms for cars and its own Shield range of devices. For Nvidia, the move to acquire Arm will have obvious synergies with its current operations and will put it squarely back in the frame as far as smartphones, computers and servers go. Much of Arm\u2019s value lies in its design and licensing programs, so it is unlikely to have any impact on Apple or other Arm licensees.\n\nUpdate: The deal is now official, subject to regulator approvals.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.wave3.com/2020/12/02/shively-mayor-accused-dui-falling-asleep-fast-food-drive-thru/", "authors": ["Natalia Martinez", "Published At Am", "Published Am At Am"], "title": "Shively mayor accused of DUI, falling asleep in fast-food drive-thru", "text": "Investigators said they smelled alcohol on Chester-Burton, who refused a breathalyzer test.

As the financial markets and the public crave order and clarity, Trump has a penchant for creating chaos and confusion. And at a time when expertise is paramount, Trump has hollowed out the government agencies responsible for the tasks at hand.\n\n\u201cPeople should speak without hyperbole and try to be cool, calm and collected and pay attention to the experts,\u201d said Andrew Card, a White House chief of staff in the George W. Bush administration who helped manage the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. \u201cTry not to be driven by emotion, and don\u2019t say things that are not true. This is when you stick to the facts and don\u2019t invite fear or impulsive behavior.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s charge is to calm, rather than con, a frightened nation. But now in his fourth year in office, he lacks credibility with broad swaths of the country \u2014 the sort of safety net that many of his predecessors could fall back on in moments of crisis.\n\nStephen Morrison, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he directs the center\u2019s global health work, said that while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has done \u201ca fine job\u201d in regularly updating the public with guidance, \u201cthe trick and the missing part is the communications at a higher level to the American public, and that\u2019s from the president and the president\u2019s designated surrogates.\u201d\n\nTrump has already contradicted his top health officials. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday that it was not a question of \u201cif\u201d coronavirus spreads in the United States but \u201cwhen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA day later, Trump offered a different assessment: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable,\u201d the president said at his news conference. \u201cI think that there\u2019s a chance that it could get worse. There\u2019s a chance it could get fairly substantially worse. But nothing\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed that the virus might dissipate by April, when the weather warms \u2014 but while some viruses do falter in warmer temperatures, there is no clear evidence that this coronavirus will behave similarly.\n\nRon Klain, who led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and is now an adviser to former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, said a challenge for Trump in managing this crisis is his \u201cdesire to happy-talk away every problem.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBy downplaying coronavirus concerns, Klain argued, Trump may be \u201ctrying to pump the stock market, but the virus is not going to be persuaded by Trump\u2019s tweets. He needs to communicate straightforwardly with the American people what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt is not the first time Trump has provided questionable information in the middle of a crisis. Last year, as Hurricane Dorian bore down on the Eastern Seaboard, Trump used a thick black Sharpie marker to doctor an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map to support his tendentious warning to the people of Alabama that the storm would probably hit their state.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidency has been guided by an ethos that then-candidate Trump articulated at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOnce in office, Trump shunned government experts. He shortened or tuned out some of his intelligence and national security briefings and rejected some of the conclusions of scientists. He relied on his instincts, rather than the expertise of those around him, to make decisions in virtually every realm.\n\n\u201cI have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else\u2019s brain can ever tell me,\u201d Trump said in a 2018 interview with The Washington Post \u2014 a statement about his feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell but one that also illustrates his overall governing philosophy.\n\nIn the scientific community, Trump has been similarly dismissive. By the spring of his first year in office, there were nearly 700 vacant positions at the CDC because of a hiring freeze that officials said would affect programs supporting infectious-disease control and health-emergency readiness.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s 2021 budget, submitted to Congress this month, proposes cuts to a broad array of health and scientific programs, including trimming the CDC\u2019s funding by almost 16 percent and reducing overall funding for global health initiatives.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to beat this with the \u2018deep state\u2019 \u2014 that is, the experts inside [the National Institutes of Health] and CDC and Homeland Security,\u201d Klain said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a general view in this administration that they don\u2019t trust these permanent experts who\u2019ve served Democratic and Republican administrations both.\u201d\n\nFor Trump, the political stakes of bungling the coronavirus response could be devastating. The president and his advisers have long relied on robust financial markets, low unemployment and high consumer confidence to smooth his path to reelection. \u201cI\u2019ll be running on the economy,\u201d Trump said in 2019.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut faced with fears of a global pandemic, U.S. markets fell sharply throughout the week \u2014 making it one of the worst weeks since the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nPast presidents who have failed to manage crises have often faced swift political backlash. Bush struggled to recover from his handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which left over 1,200 dead and displaced thousands more across the Gulf Coast. In the next year\u2019s midterm elections, Bush\u2019s Republican Party lost control of both houses of Congress.\n\n\u201cThe Katrina comparison is very apt,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis has potentially enormous consequences for the United States. It has enormous consequences that will touch many more citizens than Katrina touched, potentially.\u201d\n\nIt remains unclear just how the coronavirus will play out \u2014 whether it will become Trump\u2019s Katrina or, defying alarmist assumptions, prove a testament to Trump\u2019s managerial prowess.\n\nBut already there are signs that the administration\u2019s handling of the current crisis has assumed a distinctly Trumpian sheen. The president initially weighed in on Twitter while traveling abroad in India, offering an uncomfortable dissonance from the facts playing out on the ground in the United States and around the globe.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cStock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d he wrote on the day the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,000 points. In another, later tweet, he misspelled the name of the virus as \u201ccaronavirus.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the president was fuming, in public and in private, over news coverage of the virus and the market collapse and quickly personalized the crisis. Trump accused news organizations and Democratic congressional leaders of intentionally trying to scare people to make him look bad.\n\nOnly upon his return to Washington, as he realized that the coronavirus was dominating all news cycles, did Trump decide to try to assume more of a leadership role, scheduling a news conference that he would lead Wednesday evening.\n\nBut even that had a slapdash quality. All day, reports of infighting among Trump\u2019s top staffers, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, leaked to the news media. And the president\u2019s announcement that he was deputizing Vice President Pence to oversee all handling of the outbreak blindsided administration officials, including those deeply involved in the response.\n\nThe president \u2014 an avowed germophobe \u2014 also couldn\u2019t help but insert himself squarely into the discussion. As he talked about preventive measures, he offered his own personal-hygiene perspective, suggesting people treat the coronavirus like the common flu.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.darkhorizons.com/ancestors-game-sets-pc-launch-in-august/", "authors": [], "title": "\u201cAncestors\u201d Game Sets PC Launch In August", "text": "The independent open-world survival game \u201cAncestors: The Humankind Odyssey,\u201d which hails from former \u201cAssassin\u2019s Creed\u201d creative director Patrice Desilets, is officially set to launch on PC via the Epic Games Store on August 27th.\n\nAn ambitious and immersive game with a unique setting, it asks players to survive and evolve in the jungles of Africa over millions of years.\n\nStarting as a primate, they must advance their clan from one generation to the next by foraging for food, fighting off predators, and learning abilities that can be passed down to future clan members.\n\n\u201cAncestors\u201d will be a timed Epic Games Store exclusive when it launches on PC in August and will come to additional digital PC retailers later.\n\nSource: Private Division", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/arbys-mcdonalds-fish-sandwich", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "title": "Arby's takes swipe at McDonald's with fish sandwich campaign", "text": "A nation already polarized over chicken sandwiches is now faced with another fast-food debate: who has the best fish sandwich?\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe so-called \"surf war\" ensued this weekend between two fast-food giants after Arby's took a swipe at McDonald's in a new campaign centered around which chain has the best fish sandwich.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % MCD MCDONALD'S CORP. 217.09 -0.33 -0.15%\n\nArby's, known for \"having the meats,\" debuted a limited-time two-for-$6 offer over the weekend tied to its Crispy Fish Sandwich and the new Fish n\u2019 Cheddar Sandwich.

Trillions of dollars were pumped into financial markets in 2020 and that won't come without consequences. Economists expect that investors will be Bracing For Inflation in 2021.\n\n(Kitco News) - Gold and silver futures prices are sharply lower in early U.S. trading Friday. The safe-haven metals are seeing selling pressure amid rallying global stock markets that see the U.S. indexes at record highs today. It could also be that the meteoric price rise in bitcoin prices this week and its present media attention are pulling away investor demand for the metals. February gold futures were last down $29.00 at $1,884.60 and March Comex silver was last down $0.616 at $26.65 an ounce.\n\nThe data point of the week, if not the month, is today\u2019s Employment Situation Report issued by the Labor Department. That report showed a U.S. unemployment rate of 6.7% and a non-farm jobs decline of 140,000 in December, versus a rise of 245,000 in November. The December jobs report was expected to show a rise of 50,000 workers. However, the big miss on the downside in the ADP national employment report on Wednesday had many thinking the same would occur in Friday\u2019s jobs report, which was the case. Today\u2019s big miss on the jobs consensus forecast did not significantly move markets. Reason: Traders and investors are so keenly focused on the bullish aspects of the likely end of the raging pandemic this year and the ensuing expected booms in world economies. That focus did not even waver when the U.S. Capitol was stormed by an angry mob this week, as the U.S. stock market continued to march higher.\n\nGlobal stock markets were mostly up overnight. U.S. stock indexes are pointed toward higher openings and new record highs when the New York day session begins. Trader and investor risk appetite remains upbeat, due in part to notions a Democratic president and Congress will provide massive spending in the coming months to prop up U.S. businesses and Americans hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, which is still raging but which also sees some light at the end of the dark tunnel due to successful vaccines.\n\nA feature this first week of the trading year is the re-emergence of the inflation trade. Many commodity futures markets are in bull runs, led by crude oil. The U.S. Treasury markets are seeing rising yields, with the benchmark 10-year note yield now fetching 1.10%, after trading below the 1.0% level since late last winter. Meantime, the U.S. dollar index this week hit a 2.5-year low as the greenback continues to depreciate on the foreign exchange market. To anyone who has studied economics, it seems nearly unfathomable that the massive injections of liquidity into global financial systems over the past months (read that central banks printing money) cannot produce problematic inflation down the road. Rising commodity prices are a harbinger of that problematic inflation scenario.\n\nThe key \u201coutside markets\u201d today see the U.S. dollar index slightly up, while Nymex crude oil futures prices are higher, hit a 10-month high overnight and are trading around $51.50 a barrel.\n\nOther U.S. economic data due for release Friday includes monthly wholesale trade data and consumer credit.\n\nTechnically, the February gold futures bulls still have the overall near-term technical advantage but are fading. A five-week-old price uptrend on the daily bar chart has been at least temporarily negated. Bulls\u2019 next upside price objective is to produce a close in February futures above solid resistance at this week\u2019s high of $1,962.50. Bears' next near-term downside price objective is pushing futures prices below solid technical support at $1,858.00. First resistance is seen at $1,900.00 and then at the overnight high of $1,918.40. First support is seen at the overnight low of $1,875.10 and then at $1,858.00. Wyckoff's Market Rating: 6.0\n\nMarch silver futures bulls have the overall near-term technical advantage amid a five-week-old price uptrend in place on the daily chart. Silver bulls' next upside price objective is closing prices above solid technical resistance at the August 2020 high of $30.365 an ounce. The next downside price objective for the bears is closing prices below solid support at $26.00. First resistance is seen at $27.00 and then at the overnight high of $27.335.

Second, he himself in his own words drew that red line, and then third, he failed to enforce it.\"\n\n\"Here, President Trump's Iran policy is working,\" Cotton said, pointing out that Iran is \"lashing out\" due to feeling the effects of sanctions. He went on to note that, unlike Obama, Trump did not draw any red line \"in his own language,\" but has made it clear that the U.S. will not tolerate any attacks on American servicemembers or citizens, which has yet to take place.\n\n\"And he's also said that major sanctions are going to be added tomorrow, which is only going to increase the sanctions that they already face, which is one very positive result so far of the maximum pressure campaign,\" Cotton said.\n\nWallace then asked if the president's decision to call off a strike will embolden Iran to act on their nuclear aspirations. Cotton said that Trump's decision to hold off on military options should encourage European allies to join the U.S. in upping sanctions against Iran.\n\n\"About Iran's threats to enrich uranium to levels beyond what was permitted in the nuclear deal ... this is really going to be a question for the Europeans, Cotton said. \"I would say to those European leaders that given the fact that the president exercised restraint in this last week, they should view that as an opening to double down with the United States on those sanctions if Iran bypasses those enrichment limits.\"\n\nBOLTON TO IRAN: DON'T MISTAKE 'US PRUDENCE AND DISCRETION FOR WEAKNESS'\n\nTrump, meanwhile, will make sure that a nuclear Iran will not become a reality, he said.\n\n\"Just like an attack on an American ship or any harm to American servicemembers or citizens in the region, the president has also been very clear he will not allow Iran to approach [creating] a nuclear weapon.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/wilmington-convention-biden-harris/2020/08/20/fc264fbc-e31a-11ea-8181-606e603bb1c4_story.html", "authors": ["Annie Linskey", "National Political Reporter Focused On The Presidential Campaign"], "title": "The only thing missing from the Democratic convention? Democrats.", "text": "But that\u2019s where the similarity to normal ended at the site of the two tent-pole addresses for the 2020 Democratic National Convention. The setup had the party\u2019s nominees deliver their major addresses \u2014 Sen. Kamala D. Harris on Wednesday night, Joe Biden on Thursday night \u2014 to a chamber whose emptiness was offset only by a handful of reporters, seated in chairs set about six feet part, along with some production staff and aides.\n\nThe eeriest part of the coronavirus-forced arrangement was the silence. As Harris (D-Calif.) spoke late Wednesday, the only noise came from reporters, typing. After Harris finished, and a massive screen showed live reactions from a grid of supporters, she clapped a few times \u2014 the only noise made by a human in the hall for a time, although soon came the sound viewers at home could hear, of applause from those in the electronic boxes on the screen.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic convention has unspooled in a way unimaginable six months ago, when planning was underway for a big bash in Milwaukee in July. In a slow-moving realization of the impact of the pandemic, Democrats pushed the event to August, then drastically reduced the size of it, then scrapped all of the live events in Milwaukee except for speeches by Biden and Harris. And then those, too, were axed and moved to Biden\u2019s hometown of Wilmington, Del.\n\nThe national party conventions have long been stripped of their initial purpose: providing a locale where party bosses in smoke filled rooms brokered presidential tickets. But they\u2019ve persisted as an important networking event for local, state and national officials who otherwise don\u2019t overlap much in a single social setting. Now that, too, has been lost in this fitful year, along with so much else.\n\n\u201cI do miss just the whole excitement in the room, the over-the-topness of it,\u201d said Amber Viola, a Democratic delegate from Scranton, Pa. Viola, like nearly all delegates, stayed home for the convention, though she took two days off from her job as a municipal worker in Scranton to attend various virtual events during the day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Democratic Party worked to replicate some of the typical experience. Political figures attending the various state delegation breakfasts and online gatherings have been generous with their personal emails, addresses and cellphones, according to several delegates. The swapping of contact information left several delegates hoping they had managed to forge lasting connections with some Democratic leaders even though they never met in person.\n\nThe national and state parties mailed packets to delegates filled with Democratic-themed goodies, including pens, buttons, stickers and a water bottle. Yet even the swag nodded to the virus and the new online way of life.\n\nViola\u2019s included a paper mask emblazoned with \u201cPA Votes Blue,\u201d hand sanitizer and a bandana-size towel that has befuddled Viola and other delegates. \u201cIt\u2019s a random piece of cloth that everyone is trying to figure out,\u201d she said. Viola has decided it\u2019s intended to wipe off her screen.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor the small number of people able to witness the two big speeches in person, considerable preparation was required. The Democratic National Committee asked those who would be in a room with Biden or Harris to self-isolate for 72 hours before entering a \u201chealth and safety zone\u201d in Wilmington where tests would be given and then to self-quarantine during the convention.\n\nOne break from the isolation came with a daily trip to the Westin Wilmington for coronavirus testing arranged by the DNC. Anyone setting foot in the Chase Center, where the speeches were given, needed to have a negative test the day before. And anyone set to see the speeches by Biden and Harris had to test negative for coronavirus on two consecutive days.\n\nEveryone within the perimeter around the center had to wear face coverings. Many DNC staff members went a step further, with clear plastic shields covering their entire faces.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBeing in an environment where people were regularly tested and found to be negative provided a measure of relief for some. But the sense of security also served as a reminder of the larger failure in the country to protect everyone else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like everything else in America, the rich and the powerful are protected,\u201d said one member of the production crew, standing outside the Westin hotel and chatting with colleagues after taking his test.\n\n\u201cThey are not doing this for us,\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he had signed a nondisclosure agreement as a condition of his employment. \u201cWe are disposable.\u201d\n\nInstead, he said, the tests were being done to protect Biden and Harris. Once the job was done, he noted, the coronavirus daily testing ends for him.\n\nAD\n\n(Biden has said that if he\u2019s elected president, he would ensure the \u201cwide availability of free testing.\u201d)\n\nMost who tuned in for the convention \u2014 even most delegates \u2014 did not undergo any of this kind of hassle. State delegation breakfasts were conducted online; caucus meetings and other such gatherings also were beamed to participants via computer screens.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is trying to network virtually,\u201d said North Dakota state Rep. Ruth Buffalo, who was attending \u2014 from her home \u2014 her first convention this year. She was keeping her calendar full, and has attended the virtual women\u2019s caucus and the poverty council, among others.\n\nAD\n\nSpeaking early Thursday, she said she was also looking forward to speaking later in the day on a panel with actor Mark Ruffalo.\n\nAD\n\nOn Tuesday, as she took part in an online meeting of the Native American Caucus, she liked that there was a chat feature on the screen that let her interact with others at the event without speaking. But she noticed the text box filled up with comments from people she described as trolls, and then the box disappeared. (Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014 who once claimed Native heritage but now acknowledges that she\u2019s White \u2014 was speaking at the meeting, and the Trump campaign blasted out a link to it, asking supporters to comment, which prompted the chats to be closed, as first reported by the Washington Examiner.)\n\nIn Wilmington, reminders that this whole production was supposed to take place somewhere else were evident.\n\nAD\n\nThe plastic credentials issued to enter a gate on the perimeter featured an image of the Milwaukee Art Museum, a building 900 miles away in the city that was supposed to host the marquee events in a pre-coronavirus time.\n\nAD\n\nEven the blue lollipop signs emblazoned with names of states featured a Democratic National Convention 2020 logo with an image of Wisconsin in the \u201c0.\u201d\n\nThe state signs caught Harris\u2019s attention after her speech, as she looked out into a mostly empty room and picked out the one for Delaware.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/e3fe25aabbfc1fee055b0e14e7708cfa", "authors": ["Stan Choe", "Damian J.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Optimism returned to Wall Street on Friday, and stocks rallied to cap a shaky week dogged by worries that rising coronavirus counts may halt the economy\u2019s recent upswing.\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 1%, and the biggest gains came from cruise ship operators, airlines, banks and other companies that most need the economy to continue to reopen and strengthen.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 369.21 points, or 1.4%, to 26,075.30. The Nasdaq composite added 69.69, or 0.7%, to 10,617.44, a new high. The S&P 500 rose 32.99 to 3,185.04.\n\nAfter starting Friday with modest drops, stocks and Treasury yields erased their declines to drive higher. In a signal of rising expectations for the economy, the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks rose more than the rest of the market, up 1.7%.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey\u2019re the latest eddies in what was an erratic week for markets. Prices swung, sometimes sharply within a single day, with worries about rising hospitalizations and COVID-19 trends in Florida and other hotpots around the world. The S&P 500 flip-flopped between a gain and loss through each day of the week.\n\nAnalysts said an encouraging report from Gilead Sciences about its investigational treatment of COVID-19, remdesivir, helped drive Friday\u2019s rebound.\n\n\u201cSo, for the first time in a lot of days we\u2019re seeing smaller caps outperform,\u201d said Bob Shea, CEO of TrimTabs Asset Management. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing just a kind of mean-reversion day, and they\u2019re using the Gilead news to do it.\u201d\n\nThe week\u2019s meandering action was a microcosm of the up-and-down churn that stocks have been stuck in for a little more than a month. The market\u2019s momentum has stalled since early June, after the S&P 500 roared back to recover most of an earlier 34% plummet. Massive amounts of aid from central banks and governments around the world ignited the rally.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with an unprecedented time economically,\u201d said Katerina Simonetti, senior portfolio manager at UBS Private Wealth Management. \u201cWe have to remember that the government support and economic stimulus has been historically unprecedented. That\u2019s a huge deal, and it\u2019s going to make a difference for this market.\u201d\n\nIt also helped send the S&P 500 to a 1.8% rise for the week, its second straight weekly gain.\n\n\u201cThe market is in a kind of place where good news is a rally and bad news \u2018the Fed\u2019s got us,\u2019\u201d said Shea of TrimTabs Asset Management. \u201cThat\u2019s the win-win the market has had for the last several weeks.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStocks of companies that most need the economy to continue improving and reopening dominated the top of Friday\u2019s leaderboard.\n\nCruise operator Carnival jumped 10.8%, Royal Caribbean Cruises gained 9.9% and United Airlines rose 8.3%.\n\nBanks were also particularly strong, and financial stocks in the S&P 500 climbed 3.5% for the biggest gain among the 11 sectors in the index. A stronger economy would mean their borrowers are better able to repay their loans.\n\nJPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both rose 5.5%, while Citigroup jumped 6.5%.\n\nEnergy stocks rose with the price of oil, which has swung sharply with hopes for the economy. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 93 cents to settle at $40.55 per barrel. Brent crude added 89 cents to $43.24 per barrel.\n\nLagging behind the rest of the market were some of the stocks that have been holding up best this year: big tech-oriented giants. Microsoft dipped 0.3%, and Apple edged up 0.2%. It\u2019s at least a pause for such stocks, which have climbed through the pandemic this year as investors bet they\u2019ll keep growing almost regardless of the economy\u2019s strength.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which tends to move with investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation, rose to 0.64% from 0.60% late Thursday.\n\nIn overseas stock markets, European markets climbed after reports showed industrial production bounced back sharply in some countries.\n\nThe CAC 40 in France added 1%, while Germany\u2019s DAX returned 1.2%. The FTSE 100 in London gained 0.8%.\n\nAsian markets were more subdued. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo shed 1.1%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong retreated 1.8% to 25,727.41 and the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.8%.\n\nEven Chinese stocks took a break from their torrid run.

Tim Walz and education leaders: A return to full classroom use, a continuation of distance learning started in the spring, or a hybrid that uses both approaches. Last spring all school activities were canceled when school buildings closed in favor of distance learning.\n\nThe board approved a second task force to significantly overhaul what board treasurer Tom Jerome called \"an unsustainable and in some ways archaic\" approach to funding the $9 million organization. The shift is expected to push for the league's nearly 500 member schools to contribute more financially to reduce the reliance on state tournaments, which currently generate about 80% of the league's revenue.\n\nTime is short for both groups.\n\nWalz and state officials are expected to announce their decision about schools in about two weeks, with fall season practice scheduled to begin just three weeks later, on Aug. 17. If fall activities are canceled, the league is projecting a $466,000 deficit, according to figures provided to board members at Tuesday's virtual meeting.\n\nThat deficit balloons to $3.2 million if winter activities are also canceled. That would include the boys' hockey state tournament, the league's biggest revenue-generating activity.\n\nIts uncertain whether the BOLD Warriors, shown in the 2019 Prep Bowl, or anyone will play football this fall.\n\nTuesday's meeting was the board's seventh of the school year, an additional gathering scheduled in response to the rapidly changing environment.\n\nThe return-to-play task force is composed of the league's eligibility committee and liaisons from around the state. League Executive Director Erich Martens said the group should expect \"about a week and a half of significant work\" to prepare the high school league's plans.\n\nAt a league board workshop Monday, members offered options such as moving some or all fall sports to the spring of 2021 if classes are not fully resumed in schools. Or instead of moving sports, holding fewer competitions with shorter seasons and limited postseason tournaments.\n\nThe league's financial concerns predate the onset of the coronavirus in March.\n\nIn February, the directors unanimously approved raising each school's annual league membership fee from $120 to $160 for the 2020-21 school year. In addition, the fee that schools pay the league per activity also rose from $120 to $160. And schools also will be charged $1 per student enrolled, adjusted for free- and reduced-lunch numbers.\n\nThe effect of those activity fee increases on individual students and families was left for schools to decide.\n\nThose increases were the first step in a desired revenue stream change. Currently, about 80% of the league's funding comes from ticket sales, television and sponsorship revenue generated by what assistant director Rich Matter called \"our state tournament product.\"\n\nMartens said \"the programming our schools seek is a $5 million product\" that includes about $650,000 in catastrophic and concussion insurance. The league sponsors 43 activities and prefers moving toward basing the operating budget on sustainable school-produced fees rather than unpredictable state tournament revenue.\n\nThe increased school fees represented much of what had been expected to be an $800,000 excess in revenue after expenses for the school year before COVID-19 wiped out much of the boys' and girls' basketball state tournaments and the spring sports season.\n\nSince then, the league has laid off two staff members while two additional jobs are expected to be left vacant.\n\n\"It's not a knee-jerk reaction,\" Jerome said. \"But I think the changes brought by the pandemic have forced this issue out of the shadows and into the light.\"\n\nThe task force will explore the necessary dollars and cents while also selling schools on the increased fees.\n\n\"The problem is, this isn't incremental. We need it now,\" said board member Mike Domin, a Minnesota School Board Association representative. \"Are some schools going to balk? Some probably will. But I think they will see the value.\"\n\nThe next board of directors meeting is Aug. 4.\n\nAt that meeting the league is expected to take action ending the sale of printed state tournament programs. The league's marketing and communications committee recommended switching to downloadable programs \u2014 something 31 states do. It would provide annual savings of $170,000 to $195,000.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.pinstripealley.com/2020/6/12/21287880/yankees-mlb-draft-2020-austin-wells-trevor-hauver-beck-way-poll", "authors": ["Peter Brody", "Jun"], "title": "MLB Draft 2020: How did the Yankees do?", "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of our society, and one area that has seen its landscape shift drastically is MLB. Ignoring the ongoing disagreement between owners and union regarding player compensation and the format of the 2020 season, one area in which a concrete change was agreed upon and implemented was the 2020 MLB Draft. The Draft, which concluded yesterday, was shortened from 40 rounds to only five, giving far fewer young ballplayers, at least in this years\u2019 class, a chance to pursue their dreams as a major leaguer.\n\nWith only three picks in the abbreviated draft, the Yankees were under pressure to make each of those selections count. While in a normal length draft, there is ample opportunity to address areas of need in the later rounds, the shortage of selections for the Yankees may have steered them more toward the approach of taking the best player available. Let\u2019s see which strategy they employed and evaluate how they performed with their selections.\n\nFirst Round: C Austin Wells, 28th overall\n\nWith their first pick, the Yankees selected Austin Wells, a catcher out of the University of Arizona. The lefty slashed .357/.476/.560 in 71 college games and was ranked 27th by MLB Pipeline and 21st by Baseball America.\n\nWells is the second catcher selected in the first round by the Yankees in the last three years, and third taken with a top-50 pick. Anthony Seigler was drafted in the first round of the 2018 draft, and the Yankees followed that up by picking Josh Breaux in the second round. Both catchers came with sterling pedigrees, but faced injury difficulties in their first seasons, with Seigler missing time to a knee injury and Breaux to elbow issues.\n\nGiven the delay to those two prospects\u2019 development, and some people\u2019s perpetually lingering questions about Gary Sanchez\u2019s durability and long-term health, it can never hurt to have more depth at the catcher position (to be clear, I have zero belief that Wells will challenge Sanchez as Yankees catcher).\n\nWhen asked what they thought of the pick, PSA readers graded it at around a B+, and I am inclined to agree with that assessment. His hitting and power tool are clearly what will carry him to the majors, as he is a below-average receiver behind the plate, and struggles with elbow injuries have hindered his throwing ability.\n\nWells also brings some intangibles to the plate, with his willingness \u201cto do whatever it takes to get to the big leagues...So if that\u2019s at another position, I\u2019ll just hit home runs at Yankee Stadium and play wherever they need me to,\u201d indicating his maturity. His fiery competitiveness has drawn comparisons to Bryce Harper, while his frame, power, and positional questions call to mind Kyle Schwarber.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nThird Round: 2B/OF Trevor Hauver, 99th overall\n\nWith their second pick, the Yankees selected Trevor Hauver, outfielder out of Arizona State University. Hauver set the table for first overall pick Spencer Torkelson with the Sun Devils, posting a 1.007 OPS in 57 games as a sophomore in 2019 and slashing .339/.494/.695 through 17 games before the season\u2019s cancellation. Despite these commendable numbers, MLB Pipeline had him ranked at 130th while Baseball America had him even lower at 201st.\n\nHauver is a former high school shortstop with no standout tools, but a good makeup and maturity levels. I\u2019ve heard this story before. It is interesting to note that Hauver was announced as a second baseman during the draft, so, like Wells, it remain to be seen at which position he will stick in the Yankees\u2019 organization.\n\nThe Yankees may have reached a bit by taking him at 99th overall, however I don\u2019t fault the Bombers for drafting underslot here, given their draft bonus pool allotment of $3,520,000 for 2020. With around $2.5 million probably going to Wells, saving a little money with their third round selection is understandable.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nFourth Round: RHP Beck Way, 129th overall\n\nThe Yankees partially make up for their underwhelming third-round selection by taking Northwest Florida State College RHP Beck Way with the 129th pick. Way is the top JUCO prospect according to Baseball America, and was listed at 85th by Baseball America, 80th by FanGraphs, and 83rd by The Athletic\u2019s Keith Law.\n\nWay\u2019s primary offering is a fastball that sits at 91-94 while occasionally touching 97 miles per hour. He also sports a slider, changeup, and cutter, and posted a 0.67 ERA with 58 strikeouts and nine walks 40 innings of the abbreviated 2020 college season.\n\nOne area of mild concern: Beck made a verbal commitment to LSU, but could forgo D1 ball for a chance to join the Yankees. Given his comments that \u201cThe perfect scenario would be if my name gets called within those five rounds... That\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d I think it is fairly safe to assume he will be signing with the Yankees in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Yankees appear to have snagged an above-slot starter with their fourth round selection, and could use the savings from drafting Hauver to secure Way\u2019s signature. There is always a need for lively arms on the farm, and the Yankees scouts must be impressed with Way\u2019s consistent, repeatable delivery and command of the strike zone.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nAnd now I turn it to you, our readers: how would you grade the Yankees\u2019 overall draft?

In 2017, he played in all 16 games for the Bills, including six starts. He re-signed with the Bills in 2018 on a one-year deal and played in 15 games for them in that season as well. Before the 2019 season, he signed yet another one-year deal with the Bills, but was released during the preseason and brought back to their practice squad.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Vikings intend to work Yarbrough into their rotation. We\u2019ve seen a lot of good things from players such as Ifeadi Odenigbo and Armon Watts over the last few weeks of this season, and the Vikings have at least one solid backup at the defensive end spot already in Stephen Weatherly.\n\nOnce we have the corresponding roster move to put Yarbrough on the 53-man, we will update this post with it.", "tweets": [{"created_at": "Tue Dec 31 20:15:05 +0000 2019", "id": 1212104912580104194, "id_str": "1212104912580104194", "full_text": "The Vikings have signed DE Eddie Yarbrough off of the Bills\u2019 practice squad, per source.

Every tiny movement could be something waiting to jump out and grab me. My imagination is often more vivid \u2014 and terrifying \u2014 than any actual monster I end up facing.\n\nIn Luigi\u2019s case, the ghosts haunting him in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 are quite real. His panicked muttering as he turns a doorknob, and his habit of jumping at every little bump in the night, are justified. He never becomes less terrified, even as he clears floor after floor of ghosts in a haunted hotel.\n\nThis is our scaredy-cat hero\u2019s best adventure yet, and it\u2019s made even better by just how much he dislikes being on it.\n\nPolygon Recommends is our way of endorsing our favorite games. When we award a game the Polygon Recommends badge, it\u2019s because we believe the title is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive or fun \u2014 and worth fitting into your schedule. If you want to see the very best of the best for your platform(s) of choice, check out Polygon Essentials .\n\nLuigi and his friends \u2014 Mario, Peach, and three Toads \u2014 arrive at a gleaming hotel with the promise of a relaxing vacation. (Haven\u2019t they been fooled by this trick before?) The hotel doesn\u2019t take long to reveal its haunted side, trapping everyone except Luigi in paintings, and forcing him reluctantly on the rescue yet again.\n\nThe premise isn\u2019t exactly new. It\u2019s been most of the decade since Luigi\u2019s last spooky foray on the Nintendo 3DS, and the series\u2019 well-defined style has been elevated by the extra power of the Switch. Every hotel floor in Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 brims with detail, and the environmental lighting is just atmospheric enough to capture the haunted vibe without leaving me to fumble through the dark.\n\nGhosts fill the room with an otherworldly glow whenever they appear. I live for every single cinematic, which felt like they could have been snippets from a beautifully animated movie starring Luigi and his ghost dog, Polterpup. It\u2019s another prime example of Nintendo\u2019s ability to make its own games sing on hardware that tends to be much less powerful than the competition.\n\nAfter the hotel\u2019s spooky transformation, all its elevator buttons get snatched away by its spectral occupants, and Luigi must go floor by floor to find each one by beating that floor\u2019s boss. The paintings are scattered through the hotel too, so I eventually locate them and rescue trapped Professor E. Gadd, inventor of all the ghost-battling technology, and a handful of Toads while making my way to the top.\n\nLuigi\u2019s Mansion: Dark Moon for 3DS started equally strong for me, but my interest flagged after a few hours due to the often repetitive nature of the game. Developer Next Level Games never stops surprising me. Each of the hotel\u2019s 15 floors (plus two basement levels) is remarkably different from the previous one. There are levels you might expect to find in a luxury hotel (retail stores, a gym, and a plush music venue), and wild flights of fancy that stretch far beyond what a single floor should contain (one level features a pyramid full of traps, and a pirate ship docked in a whole harbor is somehow tucked into the middle of the building).\n\nLuigi uses many of the same tools from previous Luigi\u2019s Mansion games. His Poltergust, a backpack with a vacuum cleaner attachment, can suck up pretty much anything: trash, sand, or ghosts. It can rip curtains from walls or spin large valves to change water levels. Reversing the flow of air allows me to blow things away, or shoot objects stuck in its craw at obstacles or enemies.\n\nThere\u2019s also a suction cup I fire, then attach to my vacuum so I can topple furniture or flip switches, an amped-up flashlight to stun ghosts, and a shimmery Dark Light whose beam reveals secrets when shone on them. Luigi can now also shoot a blast of air that operates much like a butt stomp in past Mario games, allowing me to scatter enemies or knock things loose from the environment.\n\nThese are simple tools, but Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 never stops finding creative ways for me to use them. Depending on whatever imaginative level I\u2019m on, blowing air can also be used push carts on wheels, or to unfurl a large leaf for Luigi to walk across. A burst of air can open the service counter so I can sneak behind the front desk. There always seemed to be a hidden object (or ghost!) to uncover with my Dark Light.\n\nThe game even rewards my most chaotic instincts. I saw a huge tuba and thought, \u201cWill it make noise if I blow air through it?\u201d Hell yes it did, but doing so also rewarded me with a shower of cash. It\u2019s easy to collect loads of in-game currency throughout the game, but it never stops being fun to hoover up every shiny coin, gold bar, or dollar bill twisting in the breeze.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised at how often Gooigi \u2014 the dead-eyed, Jello Jiggler version of Luigi, who is stored in his backpack \u2014 was essential to puzzle solving and exploration. Gooigi can do everything Luigi can, except open doors or move through even the slightest amount of water, so I\u2019d often need to pop him out when Luigi was trapped by a ghost or just unable to reach a certain item. Gooigi has a few extra powers as well, including the ability to squish through a fence or down a drain. (Also, each of Gooigi\u2019s noises are so deliciously squelchy that I loved listening to them each time I discharged him from his tank on my back.)\n\nThere are whole levels that need the human and goo to work in tandem, and in single-player mode I switch between them, leaving the other character in a weird, comical slump. (Co-op allows a player to join and just control Gooigi, but it\u2019s a lopsided experience since he can\u2019t open doors.)\n\nLevels are short enough. One trip through rarely wears out its welcome, though the game does have some backtracking I found pretty tedious. The breadth of puzzles means I never completely breezed through the hotel; each level also has six colorful gems and a bonus Boo to hunt down. Each time I felt like I needed a change of pace after a long level chocked with puzzles, I\u2019d be met with a smaller floor, focused on the boss fight.\n\nAnd the bosses are the most uneven part of Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3. Some offer the perfect amount of challenge, with creative twists on the \u201cstun, vacuum, bash\u201d formula I use on the normal enemy ghosts. The most captivating fights allowed me to remain active by giving me things to do to move the fight along, while the worst boss battles gave me little to do. I\u2019d dodge the enemy\u2019s attacks until they finally dropped a bomb I could shoot back, or they somehow got their weapon stuck in the ground, only to be dislodged after I had attacked them.\n\nBut boss fights are a small sliver of the Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 experience. Each level is a complex onion of ideas to peel back, layer by layer. Next Level Games continues its strong tradition of granting Luigi far more depth than his superstar older brother, even if he is always doomed to keep getting scared for our enjoyment.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/apr/23/nfl-draft-2020-live-picks-joe-burrow", "authors": ["Hunter Felt"], "title": "NFL draft 2020: Bengals take LSU's Burrow as first round goes to form \u2013 as it happened", "text": "What term do you want to search?

It was the eighth win in a row for a Braves team that looks more dangerous by the day.\n\nThe ninth inning was like a game unto itself. Hector Neris, who entered a perfect 14 for 14 in save chances this season, looked to have things locked down on three different occasions but just could not throw that one final strike past rookie Austin Riley or veteran Brian McCann.\n\nWhen Neris came all the way back from a 3-0 count to strike out Freddie Freeman earlier in the inning, it appeared he was on track to notch his 15th straight save. When Jay Bruce made a game-saving play by bare-handing a bouncing ball in the outfield that he ran past, it looked like fortune was on the Phillies' side.\n\nAlas.\n\nBoth Riley and McCann made soft, well-placed contact to left-center off Neris to key the win. Both were down to their final strike.\n\nNeris is an accountable guy. He has been in this position before, experiencing success and failure. When he throws a flat fastball or leaves a split too high in the zone, he admits it. He did not feel like he was terrible on this night.\n\n\"He got soft contact on a pitch I threw for a strikeout,\" Neris said of the Riley at-bat, which cut the Phillies' lead to one and put runners on second and third with two outs. \"He got terrible contact on that single. I can't control that.\"\n\nAnd the McCann AB?\n\n\"It was down, it just struck the bat,\" he said. \"Looking at the pitch, lucky for him. But tomorrow, you know, I got it tomorrow, for sure.\"\n\nWhen you lose like this, all there is to do is look forward to tomorrow. A loss like this is too hard to swallow if you think too long about it or replay every moment.\n\nThe Phillies were in control for two and a half hours. They got three long home runs from Bryce Harper, Rhys Hoskins and Scott Kingery and led 7-2 entering the bottom of the seventh. They got a mostly solid start from Nick Pivetta, who had allowed just a pair of runs on solo homers through six.\n\nBut the bullpen, which is ravaged by injuries and not good enough to win a division as currently constructed, gave it all back.\n\n\"A crushing loss, no way around it,\" manager Gabe Kapler said. \"We had a two-run lead in the ninth inning with our best reliever on the mound. Neris has been tremendous for us all year long. Outstanding for a full calendar year. Can't wait to get him back out on the mound in that same kind of situation. We have the highest level of trust with him in that situation. We felt really good in the dugout about it. It's just a devastating loss. We'll come back tomorrow and be ready to fight again.\"\n\nFans raced to social media to play Monday morning quarterback, a common occurrence when a big lead is lost. So many act like every decision the manager made was so plainly stupid and should have been changed. Looking at the choices Kapler made late in this game, no glaring mistake caused this loss. The Braves are just really good. They don't swing and miss much and they don't quit.\n\nDid Kapler leave Pivetta in too long? Who's to say? You saw what the bullpen ended up doing. And in the long run, showing confidence in Pivetta with two outs and a man on second in the seventh inning against a hitter he'd retired all three times earlier in the night could be beneficial for him. Extending him to 116 pitches could be a confidence-builder and Pivetta acknowledged as much after the game.\n\nWhy use Jose Alvarez in the eighth? You tell me who you're going to in that spot, with lefties Nick Markakis and McCann due up and switch-hitting Ozzie Albies to follow.\n\nWhy not intentionally walk McCann with two outs and two on and pitch to Albies instead? Because Albies is a skilled hitter who is 14 for 33 (.424) over his last nine games and could have just as easily beaten Neris as McCann did. In fact, Albies may have been more of a threat, considering he's fast enough to beat out an infield hit, and another walk would have forced in the tying run.\n\n\"It was discussed when McCann came up to the plate,\" Kapler said. \"We felt like we had the right matchup there. Albies is the kind of guy that if he puts the ball in play he can beat out a single. There are so many things that can happen. The split can go by the catcher. We just thought the right thing there was let him go after McCann. We didn't think that ball was blistered by any stretch. We thought he made a good pitch.\n\n\"At the end of the day, there's no discounting that that was very difficult to watch.\"\n\n\n\nClick here to download the MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

They arranged to a system to put euros and pounds into each others\u2019 bank accounts, and then grew their system into a global, peer-to-peer money transfer service.\n\nLike its competitor Remitly, TransferWise has found a thriving niche by undercutting banks and wire transfer services, which can charge 5% or higher of every transaction.\n\nIn the case of TransferWise, which now has 5 million customers in over 170 countries, its transfer fees are typically well under 0.5%, while a fifth of its transactions take place in 20 seconds or less.\n\nIn an interview, co-founder Kristo Kaarmann told Fortune that the new investors will provide guidance to the company as it continues to grow, while also serving to pay out some of its early-stage backers.\n\nDespite rumors last year that TransferWise was planning to go public, Kaarmann said the company plans to stay private for the foreseeable future.\n\n\u201cAn IPO is not going to happen anytime soon. It\u2019s very unlikely to happen this year,\u201d he said. \u201cRemaining private, for now, means we can remain focused on our mission and long-term strategy, without any distractions from the markets\u2026 Lastly, in terms of capital, we\u2019re quite confident in our financial position. We love to be funded by our users.\u201d\n\nWhile TransferWise has been profitable since last year, the company has been focused on reducing its fees and expanding its geographic footprint.\n\nAccording to Kaarmann, TransferWise\u2019s profits are coming both from its traditional money transfer business, and from its newer business products, which let small and medium-sized companies keep accounts in different countries in order to pay suppliers in local currencies.\n\nAnd despite brash ads bashing banks over high fees, TransferWise is increasingly working with them to offer its services. Last year, it announced a partnership with the UK challenger bank Monzo and with France\u2019s second largest bank, BCPE.\n\nMeanwhile, as other parts of the finance industry embrace Bitcoin, Ripple and other cryptocurrencies as a means of transferring money, TransferWise has remained skeptical about such projects.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://news.yahoo.com/new-yahoo-news-you-gov-poll-half-of-trump-supporters-believe-q-anons-imaginary-claims-124025042.html", "authors": ["Andrew Romano", "Caitlin Dickson"], "title": "New Yahoo News/YouGov poll: Half of Trump supporters believe QAnon's imaginary claims", "text": "A full 50 percent of President Trump\u2019s supporters now believe the bizarre, false claims about an international ring of child sex traffickers at the core of the extremist conspiracy theory known as QAnon, according to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll \u2014 a disturbing sign of how susceptible partisans have become to bogus stories in an age of rampant polarization and unbridled social media.\n\nThe survey, which was conducted from Oct. 16 to 18, shows that most registered voters (55 percent) say they\u2019ve never heard of QAnon, including 44 percent of Trump supporters. And 59 percent of voters who have heard of QAnon describe it as \u201can extremist conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.\u201d\n\nYet these numbers understate the degree to which awareness and even acceptance of QAnon\u2019s underlying falsehoods have permeated the right, regardless of how many unwitting adherents explicitly realize such fictions originate with QAnon itself.\n\nTrump himself demonstrated this dynamic during his NBC town hall event last Thursday when he refused to disavow the conspiracy theory even after moderator Savannah Guthrie told him that it involves baseless lies about \u201csatanic\u201d Democratic pedophile rings.\n\n\u201cI know nothing about QAnon,\u201d Trump insisted \u2014 except that \u201cthey are very strongly against pedophilia and I agree with that.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Trump\u2019s supporters respond the same way. Even when asked for their \u201copinion of QAnon,\u201d very few of them \u2014 just 16 percent of those who say they\u2019ve heard of the movement \u2014 are willing to call it an extremist conspiracy theory with no basis in fact. Larger numbers, meanwhile, say \u201cit goes too far but I believe some of what I\u2019ve heard\u201d (22 percent) or that they\u2019re \u201cnot sure\u201d what to believe (47 percent). A striking 15 percent openly say \u201cI think it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nIn fact, many registered voters, including those who don\u2019t support Trump, are unsure about QAnon or even accepting to some degree, with 7 percent of those who\u2019ve heard of it saying it's true; 11 percent saying \u201cit goes too far but I believe some of what I\u2019ve heard\"; and 23 percent saying they aren\u2019t sure.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet when you remove \u201cQAnon\u201d from the question and ask solely about the conspiracy theory\u2019s underlying myth \u2014 that President Trump is secretly fighting elite child sex-trafficking rings run by leading Democratic politicians \u2014 far more people say they buy into it.\n\nHere, a staggering 50 percent of Trump supporters say they believe top Democrats are involved in elite child sex-trafficking rings. Roughly the same number (52 percent) say they believe Trump is working to dismantle such rings. Another third of Trump supporters (33 percent) say they\u2019re not sure whether these rings exist \u2014 which means that just 17 percent of Trump supporters reject the imaginary claims.\n\nAmong all registered voters, a quarter (25 percent) believe top Democrats are involved in elite child sex-trafficking rings; another quarter (24 percent) aren\u2019t sure. The vast majority of Joe Biden\u2019s supporters \u2014 82 percent \u2014 correctly identify the notion as preposterous.\n\nA man wearing a QAnon vest attends a \"No Mandatory Flu Shot Massachusetts\" demonstration against Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker's order for mandatory influenza vaccinations for all students under the age of 30, an effort to lower the burden on the health care system during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, outside the State House in Boston, Massachusetts on August 30, 2020. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nNina Jankowicz, who studies the intersection of democracy and technology as a disinformation fellow at the non-partisan Wilson Center, said it\u2019s \u201creally crazy\u201dthat \u201csuch a high number\u201d of Trump supporters believe QAnon\u2019s core conspiracy theory.\n\n\u201cIt seems increasingly like we're dealing with two different sets of facts in this country, sometimes more,\u201d Jankowicz told Yahoo News. \u201cThe fact is that QAnon is a movement, a conspiracy that has been cited by the FBI as potentially inciting terrorist and other violent extremist acts in this country. It shouldn't be something that we're this split [on] along partisan lines.\u201d\n\nJankowicz was one of the disinformation experts who testified last week at a virtual hearing of the House Intelligence Committee about the dangers of QAnon and other sources of misinformation online, which none of the committee\u2019s Republican members attended, citing security concerns.\n\nJankowicz suggested that high levels of openness toward QAnon might be a result of the movement\u2019s ability to manipulate social media algorithms and expand its reach \u2014 and circumvent detection \u2014 by absorbing a variety of misinformation narratives, including those surrounding the coronavirus vaccine, state lockdown measures and, most recently, efforts to spark a moral panic about child sex-trafficking with the viral #SavetheChildren hashtag.\n\n\u201cI think there's a lot of cross pollination and indoctrination happening there,\u201d said Jankowicz. Someone who encounters QAnon-related content through its anti-sex-trafficking messaging, she explained, might be less inclined to reject the movement as a whole. Likewise, QAnon is \u201cclearly a partisan theory that supports President Trump, so Trump supporters might not be as eager to point out its inconsistencies\u201d either.\n\nThe results of the latest Yahoo News/YouGov poll illustrate how QAnon\u2019s lies have gained traction on the right via Facebook and email. To be sure, nearly a third of registered voters (31 percent) report seeing posts on Facebook or receiving emails about child sex-trafficking. But that number is higher among Trump supporters (38 percent) than Biden supporters (24 percent) \u2014 and among those who have come across these messages, Trump supporters (26 percent) are more than twice as likely as Biden supporters (12 percent) to say they see them \u201cvery often.\u201d As a result, Trump supporters are also more alarmed about the issue, with a majority (53 percent) saying child sex-trafficking is a \u201cbig problem\u201d in the U.S. \u2014 versus just 37 percent of Biden supporters.\n\nQ-Anon conspiracy theorists hold signs during the protest at the State Capitol in Salem, Oregon, United States on May 2, 2020. (John Rudoff/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nAnti-trafficking activists and law enforcement officials say that while accurate statistics on child sex trafficking are hard to pin down, the numbers spread by QAnon and #SavetheChildren are likely inflated by orders of magnitude. In reality, the movement's false claims and misrepresentations have actually diverted resources from legitimate anti-trafficking efforts.\n\nQAnon followers have increasingly committed real-world acts of harassment and violence, yet the social-media platforms that have fueled QAnon\u2019s growth, such as Facebook and Twitter, have only recently cracked down on related content. YouTube finally took similar steps last Thursday.\n\nAt the same time, President Trump and other top Republicans have proclaimed their support for QAnon-linked congressional candidates, several of whom will now be on the ballot in November.

This could be the company's biggest hurdle", "text": "New York (CNN Business) SpaceX wants to be your next Wi-Fi provider. It's hoping to build a constellation of satellites to deliver cheap, lightning-quick broadband from space \u2014 and the toughest obstacle could be on the ground.\n\nThe company took its first major steps this year by launching the first 100-plus satellites for its network, called Starlink, with an eye toward growing the constellation to include more than 10,000 devices that will blanket the planet in internet connectivity. SpaceX executives hope initial service could roll out in parts of the United States next year.\n\nThe path ahead is filled with risk and uncertainty. Starlink is essentially a multibillion-dollar bet that Elon Musk's company can deploy a technology that others have tried and failed to build in the past. And whether the service is successful depends only partly on whether SpaceX can deploy thousands of satellites without running out of money\n\nPerhaps a bigger and more difficult question, according to industry experts, is how people will access the network. Starlink customers would need user terminals, or high-tech antennas they can stick on their roofs or in their yards to establish a useable internet connection.\n\nThe necessary technology exists. But if SpaceX wants to attract consumer, it needs to build user terminals that are affordable, reliable and low maintenance \u2014 a massive undertaking\n\nSpaceX's chief operating officer, Gwynne Shotwell, said during a recent meeting with reporters that the company is putting \"a lot of engineering\" resources into developing user terminals.\n\n\"Because if we don't get it right,\" she said. \"We're in deep doo-doo.\"\n\nWhy are ground terminals important?\n\nEven as traditional internet infrastructure has expanded rapidly in recent years, about half the global population still lacks consistent internet access, including millions of people in the United States\n\nTraditional Wi-Fi and cell services rely on an enormous web of underground cables and cell towers. It would be extremely expensive and time-consuming to connect billions of people using only those ground-based technologies.\n\nThat's why there's big interest in using satellites to blanket the globe with an affordable network. And it's not a new idea.\n\nIn the 1990s, several well-funded ventures attempted to build satellite constellations similar to Starlink. All of them either changed plans, went bankrupt or liquidated after realizing it would be impractical or too expensive.\n\nSpaceX is among a new crop of companies \u2014 which include Amazon and Softbank-backed OneWeb \u2014 that are trying again. They expect to be successful this time because satellites and rockets now are cheaper than ever. While deploying a satellite internet constellation will still be far from easy, that effort would be less likely to end in bankruptcy.\n\nGround equipment may pose the biggest obstacle to success.\n\nAntenna technology has come a long way since the 1990s. But even some industry leaders say it'll still be extremely difficult to build user terminals at the volume and price points that SpaceX will need to turn a profit.\n\nOne source involved in Teledesic, a now-defunct internet constellation business backed by Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates, said that the company learned the hard way not to underestimate the difficulty of building user terminals.\n\nIt was a key reason the venture folded in the early 2000s, the source said. In fact, it was \"probably\" the main reason, the source said.\n\nWhy are the antennas so hard?\n\nSpace-based data services already exist. They're powered primarily by massive satellites in geosynchronous orbit, more than 20,000 miles from Earth. At that distance, objects orbit at the same speed as the Earth turns, meaning satellites can stay positioned over a specific area of land and provide uninterrupted service.\n\nThat could be ideal for certain telecom services like Dish Network, which provides customers with simple satellite antennas that sits atop their roofs. They can point at the same satellite day and night.\n\nBut that system doesn't work well for internet service. Geostationary satellites require data to travel the 20,000 miles and back whenever a user clicks a link, which can cause frustrating lag times.\n\nSpaceX and its competitors want their internet constellations orbiting much closer to the ground. In Starlink's case, thousands of satellites would circle 340 miles overhead, working to deliver internet speeds rivaling the best fastest ground-based services.\n\nHow cheap do they need to be?\n\nairplanes and are used to relay in-flight Wi-Fi to passengers. Bill Milroy, the chief technology officer at US-based antenna maker ThinKom, which makes computer-controlled antennas \u2014 called \"phased array\" \u2014 that steer themselves to maintain a connection with a satellite as it streaks across the sky. The company's antennas are currently used in commercialairplanes and are used to relay in-flight Wi-Fi to passengers.\n\nMilroy said it's impossible to know exactly how expensive it would be to mass produce the kinds of user terminals that SpaceX will need.\n\nIt's a classic chicken-and-the-egg problem: You won't know how cheap they will be to manufacture until you know how many you're building, and you can't gauge demand will be until you've priced the terminals.\n\nMilroy said that if Elon Musk called him tomorrow and told him to build user terminals as cheaply as possible, ThinKom could probably get the cost down to about $1,000 each, about as much as an iPhone 11.\n\nAt those prices, Starlink might be able to win over some Americans unhappy with their current internet providers.\n\nBut, Milroy added, he doesn't believe SpaceX will attract customers in the mostly poor areas that still lack internet access altogether. The company would probably need to get user terminal prices down to about $150 a piece, or what \"a cheapo phone in India costs,\" to make a significant impact, Milroy said.\n\n\"We don't think anybody's ready to hit those kinds of price targets,\" he added.\n\nSpaceX doesn't plan to buy user terminals made by others. In typical fashion, the company will keep design and production of the user terminals in house.\n\nShotwell, the SpaceX COO, said a team of engineers have started a prototype production line at the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, California.

However, this pick seems to deliver on a new, young tandem in the frontcourt for New York in Toppin and the ever-improving Mitchell Robinson. There are some valid concerns about how the two will mesh, but equally valid reasons to be excited.\n\nWhat makes predicting how these two will fare together difficult is the fact that we\u2019ve seen little to none of Toppin playing alongside a center at Dayton. Robinson will more or less have the role he had last season, barring massive strides in his jumper. He\u2019ll pick and roll to the rim, finish lobs, work the boards and anchor the defense. Toppin was a small-ball center in college, a slot he\u2019ll get to fill once again in stretches, but not if he\u2019s paired with Robinson. Analyzing him as a stretch four changes things about his profile.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the halfcourt offense. Toppin only attempted 2.6 threes a game last season, to be expected due to his position. He shot an impressive 39% from deep, but he\u2019ll have to maintain that clip on added volume and a further arc if he\u2019s going to fit with Robinson. In other words, spacing the floor will have to be a key part of his game, not an added bonus. His quick and fundamentally sound stroke should translate easily, so long as he sticks to catch-and-shoot threes, as he made close to zero unassisted long bombs. The Knicks should use him in a bunch of pick-and-pops.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say his damage from the short corner should disappear entirely, but he can\u2019t hang around there. He\u2019ll need to be actively moving around, flashing for open shots and cutting into finishing lanes. Thankfully, most of his mobility complaints come on the defensive end, and he showed off great spatial awareness offensively at Dayton.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn one possession against Fordham, Toppin cleared to the weak-side short corner for his guard, Jalen Crutcher, to attack. Crutcher knifed into the paint, opening up a lob for Toppin, but instead passed out to a corner shooter for no shot. Toppin recognized the crammed paint, saw all the defensive attention on the (now) strong side, and quickly pivoted back to the opposite corner for a three. New York will want to see a lot of this.\n\nThings get interesting when Toppin is used as a roll man. Robinson likely won\u2019t be spreading the floor, and that\u2019s okay, because Toppin showed the ability to create for others, granted in small doses. For him and Robinson to work together, Toppin is coming in as a threat to score on the roll, but he\u2019ll need to be able to take the dump-off on a short roll, immediately read the floor and either find the shooter open or Robinson on the lob. It\u2019s a big ask that likely won\u2019t be possible right out of the gates, but can be with enough reps. As for Toppin\u2019s post-up opportunities, they should be reserved for quick hits in transition and on switches, as well as when Robinson is off the floor.\n\nToppin\u2019s transition play should thrive with Robinson not only there to clean up some of his defensive mistakes but also being a fellow standout on the break. At the four, Toppin will be in better position to sprint down the floor and fill a lane or await an outlet following a stop. Robinson is also a big threat in transition, and his rim-running could open things up for Toppin as a trailing shooter or cutter.\n\nDefense has been the biggest fear with Toppin, but like judging his offense, having Robinson behind him changes how we look at it. No longer is Toppin the primary source of rim protection for his team, instead his responsibilities are simply not to screw up too badly, versus anchoring a team defense. His lateral and backpedaling quickness have been much maligned, and is problematic for a center guarding the pick-and-roll, but maybe less so for a forward that is more likely to switch or step out to guard a shooting four. It\u2019s still not ideal and could allow for blow-bys, but having Robinson and head coach Tom Thibodeau as mentors can help lessen his liability and even turn him around on this side of the ball.\n\nRebounding is another area that will likely see Robinson shouldering much of the load, at least early on, but Toppin\u2019s verticality should eventually translate into high production there. The dream scenario for Knicks fans is getting to a point where these two are netting New York 10 extra points a night just from putbacks or kick-outs off the offensive glass. This may take some time.\n\nMeshing new pieces is always a challenge, one usually amplified by plugging in rookies that have holes in their game yet to be filled. Toppin seemed to be New York\u2019s pick for a while, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the front office coming to that conclusion without anticipating his fit with their best prospect and his future frontcourt partner. How much of the above comes to fruition and to what degree remains to be seen, but if the two manage to jell, the Knicks are looking at an enthralling and productive duo for years to come.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-frank-oz-yoda-galaxys-edge-vr-134023748.html", "authors": [], "title": "Frank Oz returns as Yoda in 'Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy's Edge'", "text": "Yoda\u2019s original voice actor, Frank Oz, will be joining Anthony Daniel\u2019s C-3PO in Star Wars: Tales from the Galaxy\u2019s Edge, the Oculus Quest VR experience launching on November 19th.

That's when we expect both the highly anticipated PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. We already know a lot about the PS5 and new Xbox thanks to recent deep dives and game reveals by both companies, and we've finally gotten a look at the PS5 with its family of accessories. But we're still missing the biggest critical piece of information: price.\n\nNeither of the new console designs was greeted sans mockery, which is funny given that they're polar opposites: the PS5 is predominantly white, slender and curvy (which Sony's PlayStation CEO Jim Ryan calls \"bold, daring and future-facing\"), and the Xbox Series X is a boxy black tower. Interestingly, Sony left the long, lingering videos of the console and its accessories until the very end of its stream, highlighting the upcoming games instead.\n\nMicrosoft held the first of its Xbox 20/20 livestreams in early May to highlight upcoming games; the next is slated for July.\n\nComplicating the availability situation is the possibility of higher-than-expected prices for the PS5 thanks to ongoing trade disputes and the continuing phone-driven shortage of memory and storage options. Plus there could conceivably be production delays resulting from steps being taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, not to mention it decimating the world economy, rendering tens of millions of people likely unable to afford it when it ships.\n\nThis next chapter of the console wars may be especially important. Not because 8K-resolution video or ray-traced audio for more natural sound will be must-have features, but because the gaming landscape is more complicated and fragmented since the last generation of boxes came out.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Watch Sony reveal the PS5\n\nIn addition to competing with PCs, consoles now face challenges from new hardware-free cloud gaming services such as Google Stadia and Nvidia GeForce Now, as well as Microsoft's own still-in-beta Project xCloud. To a lesser extent, they also compete for your time with mobile game-subscription services such as Apple Arcade.\n\nWhile the specs are quite different in places, ultimately we still don't know how many of them will translate into actual differences in experience. For example, it's tempting to say that the PS5's graphics processor is less powerful than the Xbox's because it has fewer compute units and less arithmetic power (as measured by the floating-point operations performance spec, aka TFLOPS).\n\nBut the two platforms have different hardware and software architectures, so you don't know how the components will affect their respective performance or visual quality, or where tradeoffs will hit hardest.\n\nNo matter how it balances out, though, they've both taken a big leap in power over their predecessors. They're based around roughly similar AMD Zen 2-architecture processors plus AMD Radeon Navi-generation graphics processors with 16GB of memory. They both support ray-tracing, decompression acceleration, whizzy new proprietary SSD implementations and a whole lot more. Toss in backwards compatibility with older games (which gain a lift from the faster hardware and technologies like Microsoft's HDR reconstruction), and all of this adds up to the PS5 and Xbox Series X promising noticeably better visual quality, faster frame rates and generally speedier operation than before.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: PS5's extremely techy presentation explained\n\nAs always, however, the games drive much of the real interest, especially those that will be available at launch. And price will be key, too, not just for the boxes but for the ancillary add-ons; for instance, the Xbox's 1TB SSD storage add-on uses a proprietary design, which may make it more expensive than we'd like. Right now, most educated guesses place the price at about $500 for both the Xbox and PS5 -- it's likely they'll be the same in order to compete with each other.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/15/media/trump-twitter-racist-tweetstorm-reliable-sources/index.html", "authors": ["Brian Stelter", "Cnn Business"], "title": "How news outlets are dealing with the 'moral dimension' of covering Trump and his racist tweets", "text": "New York (CNN Business) A version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nPresident Trump launched a bigoted attack against four minority congresswomen on Sunday morning. His tweets were straight up racist. Did the news media accurately describe it that way?\n\nBy and large, no, most major news outlets did not do that. Reporters and anchors took the story seriously but largely leaned on \"critics,\" primarily Democrats, and cited their accusations of racism. The significance of Trump's words risked being lost in a partisan fog.\n\nHe said/she said is a tried and true journalistic technique, of course, but it is insufficient at a time like this. If telling Democratic congresswomen to \"go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came\" isn't racist, what is?\n\nThere were some exceptions \u2014 CNN chief among the news outlets \u2014 that called out this example of racism emanating from the highest office in the land in an authoritative, institutional voice. CNN's banners and headlines said \"racist rant\" and \"racist attacks.\"\n\nThe moral dimension\n\nNYT TV critic James Poniezowik crystallized what I've been thinking all day. \"A real problem is that politics in Trump's era has taken on a moral dimension that news outlets either aren't equipped to cover, or think it's their duty to avoid,\" he tweeted. \"And if they avoid it, they avoid their job, which is to accurately represent to their audience what's happening.\"\n\nHow it was covered\n\nSo let's size up how the nation's most-read, most-watched news outlets handled the tweets. As I mentioned, CNN identified the tweets as racist throughout the day. Some MSNBC programs did, too. On Fox News, so far as I can tell, the word was only used by guests or attributed to critics.\n\nThe big three nightly newscasts used the \"critics\" crutch as well. ABC anchor Tom Llamas said Trump is \"being called racist after firing off several tweets.\" A graphic called it a \"RACIALLY CHARGED TWEET.\" Later, he said unnamed \"critics\" are calling the remarks \"racist and xenophobic.\"\n\nOn NBC, Kate Snow said the \"inflammatory\" Trump tweet was different than most, \"with many decrying it as racist.\" A package by Hans Nichols quoted various condemnations from Dem lawmakers and said 2020 candidates \"piled on\" with criticism.\n\nCBS was by far the weakest of the three, never getting close to the R-word. I was struck by this because the correspondent, Errol Barnett, did point out on Twitter that the hashtag #RacistInChief was trending. \"President Trump took aim at a familiar target today, Democrats. This time, though, he aimed at four progressive lawmakers, all of them women of color,\" anchor Elaine Quijano said. Quite a nonchalant way to describe a racist rant!\n\nOn Monday morning, there was a notable change in the broadcast TV network coverage. Anchors on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" repeatedly referenced \"the president's racist attack.\" On CBS, meanwhile, anchors still cited \"critics.\" On NBC, it was \"some have branded his comments as racist.\"\n\nNewspaper websites, with the advantages of more space and time, gave more context. But there was still reluctance to reach any editorial conclusion. The LA Times said \"it's usually considered a racist taunt.\" WaPo cited Nancy Pelosi, saying she \"described them as racist and divisive.\"\n\nThe AP's headline was blunt \u2014 \"Leave the US, Trump tells liberal congresswomen of color\" \u2014 and its story noted Trump's \"long history of making racist remarks,\" but left it to Democrats to say Sunday's tweets were racist. Same thing at the WSJ: The homepage headline was \"Trump Targets Lawmakers in Tweets Decried as Racist.\" Later it was changed to say \"Trump Targets Lawmakers in Racially Charged Tweets.\"\n\nI know that reporters in at least two newsrooms argued with their higher-ups about this language issue on Sunday. But in both cases they lost.\n\nThe NYT's main story initially cited Dem criticism, but the top of its story was later strengthened to say Trump's insult \"was widely established as a racist trope.\" Still: Widely established by who? Is it a racist trope, or not?\n\nIn a separate \"news analysis,\" Peter Baker went further, saying that \"when it comes to race, Mr. Trump plays with fire like no other president in a century.\" Here's his piece...\n\nPutting pressure on the press\n\nThis is just a sampling of the Twitter commentary I noticed on Sunday...\n\nDavid Gergen said \"it's hard to recall this much bigotry and nativism in the White House since pre-Civil War.\"\n\nBen Rhodes tweeted: \"Trump launched his political brand 8 years ago saying the first African American President was born in Africa. It has always been about racism, and the fact that this has ever been a controversial thing to say is part of the problem.\"\n\nSherrilyn Ifill \u200fwrote: \"Today's Twitter thread by Mr. Trump may be the most appalling among thousands of appalling tweets from this President.\"\n\nJoy Reid wrote: \"And now we all know him, so he feels comfortable letting it out in front of all of us.\"\n\nGeorge Conway asked: \"What would likely happen if anyone, even a CEO, made such a racist statement in any workplace in America?\"\n\nAnother tweetstorm provoked by Fox & Friends?\n\nIlhan Omar, one of the presumed targets of Trump's tweetstorm, was on stage with fellow lawmakers Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley and Deb Haaland at the Netroots Nation conference on Saturday. Media Matters' Matthew Gertz noted that \"Fox & Friends\" ran a \"DEMOCRATS DIVIDED?\" segment and played soundbites from the conference \"about 20 minutes before\" Trump's rant.\n\nI also think it's worth looking back a little further, to last Tuesday, when Tucker Carlson said Omar hates America and claimed immigrants like her are \"dangerous\" to America.

But usually the people saying \"go back\" are hateful anonymous commenters. This time \"these words are coming from the president of the United States,\" she said, sounding genuinely taken aback.\n\nJournalists, activists and ordinary citizens shared their experiences all over social media on Sunday. And the NYT asked people to send in recollections: \"Have You Been Told to 'Go Back' to Your Country Even Though You Are American? Tell Us About It.\n\n\u2192 Vox's Jane Coaston said on \"Reliable\" that Trump's underlying claim is that \"to criticize this country means you are no longer able to be a representative of this country \u2014 which is a very strange thing for someone who in 2015 described America as a hellhole to say...\"\n\nThe big picture\n\nCNN analyst Ron Brownstein speaking on Sunday afternoon: \"Under Trump, the Republican coalition has become overwhelmingly centered on the voters and the parts of the country that are most uneasy with demographic change. There was polling from PRRI last year \u2014 2/3s of Republicans now say that the growing number of immigrants threaten traditional American values and traditions. As opposed to 60% of the country, overall, saying that immigrants strengthen the society.\"\n\nTrump is centering the GOP \"primarily on the parts of the country that are least comfortable with all of these changes,\" Brownstein said. \"And everything we are seeing \u2014 from the wall, which is symbolic in its own way of standing against change \u2014 to these raids, to the openly racist tweets, is an acknowledgment of that. And what's striking is how few Republicans, however much they may grumble privately, have been willing to stand up against this redefinition of the party.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally un-American\"\n\nThere's so much more to say, but let me start to wrap up this section with Stephen Collinson's analysis for CNN.com, which is leading the homepage right now. \"The most shocking thing about Donald Trump's racist tweets is that possibly the most fundamentally un-American outburst of modern presidential rhetoric did not come remotely as a surprise,\" he wrote Sunday. \"The second most shocking aspect of an episode that would have rocked any other administration is that the President knows he can trade in such base tactics because he will pay no price in a Republican Party cowed by his fervent political base.\"\n\nKeeping track of the no-comments\n\nWith Collinson's point in mind, maybe more news outlets should follow the lead of the Tampa Bay Times, which made the lawmakers' silence a story on Sunday afternoon. \"We asked the offices of Florida's four congressional representatives who are immigrants or the children of immigrants\" for comment, Kirby Wilson wrote . As of Sunday at 11pm ET, the two reps who are Democrats have responded; the two Republicans have not. Wilson's story leaves space for their answers and says \"should they respond, this story will be updated...\"\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly quoted Tom Llamas.

The pair have been running rightwing websites since at latest 2013, according to DNS website records.\n\nThe Porrazzos now run a network of websites that enthusiastically promote Trump, and far right anti-government militias like the Three Percenters, and offer distorted versions of current events. One of their Facebook pages, \u201cPrepare to Take America Back\u201d (PTTAB) at the time of reporting had 794,876 followers. Analysis with social media metrics tool Crowdtangle shows that over the last three months PTTAB posts have been shared over 141,000 times, and on average 9,600 times a week.\n\nAt that time, the page\u2019s header featured the logo of the Three Percenters, a decentralized group that the ADL calls a \u201cwing of the militia movement\u201d; a group of armed men in tactical gear; and a modified copy of the US presidential seal.\n\nIn general, the page promotes conspiracy theories and criminal allegations about Democratic party politicians, liberal celebrities and leftist protesters, some of which \u2013 like persistent claims that Hillary Clinton will be imminently arrested \u2013 overlap with aspects of the so-called \u201cQAnon\u201d conspiracy theory movement.\n\nThe page makes free use of political memes, but many posts link to a small cluster of rightwing websites designed to appear like news outlets. Increasingly, over the course of 2020, the page has been warning of a stolen election, and suggesting this will lead to civil war.\n\nRepeatedly in September, the page linked to a story on the website Right Wing Tribune, headlined \u201cRadical Left Prepares For \u2018Mass Public Unrest,\u2019 \u2018Political Apocalypse\u2019 And Possible Civil War Should Be Expected If Biden Loses [Opinion]\u201d, with Facebook captions including \u201cthe left wants war\u201d.\n\nThe story had a limited basis in fact, in that a number of progressive groups had met in early September to discuss the prospect of civil unrest and political violence after the election with a belief that the violence they were anticipating would be coming from Trump supporters and the far right.\n\nNevertheless, the Right Wing Tribune piece concluded with a conspiracy theory: \u201cThese groups are heavily focused on removing President Trump from office as well as different scenarios which all lead to a second revolution in which they control our nation as a \u201cNew America\u201d.\u201d\n\nSimilarly distorted stories warning of a \u201csiege of the white house\u201d, peppered the page throughout September and warnings of a post-election civil war were posted over the last year.\n\nLast November, the page linked to a site called Flag and Cross, and a story which it described as an \u201cexcellent opinion piece\u201d, entitled \u201cWinning the New Civil War (OPINION)\u201d.\n\nThe piece claimed on the basis of antifascist protests and comments by Democratic politicians that, \u201cWe have many strong indications that this is a hot war\u201d.\n\nThe transparency page for PTTAB discloses that PTTAB is managed by Southern California-based AFF Media Inc, and that the Vici Media Group \u201cpartners with this page\u201d.\n\nAccording to California records, AFF Media was incorporated on Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration day, 20 January 2017; in other documents, Dino Porrazzo Jr is listed as CEO and CFO, and Dino Porrazzo Sr as secretary. But the Guardian has discovered that the Porrazzos are further involved in running a dizzying array of interconnected sites and social media pages. The Annenberg Public Policy initiative lists two of their websites on its \u201cMisinformation Directory\u201d of \u201cwebsites that have posted deceptive content\u201d.\n\nOne of the listed sites is Right Wing Tribune. But all of the other sites linked to by the PTTAB Facebook page also appear to belong to AFF, with similar design, shared bylines and shared source code.\n\nThis is not some dark corner of the Internet, this is not a fringe thing, it\u2019s mainstream Republicans. Becca Lewis, Stanford University\n\nThe Porrazzos have been previously reported as having links to the Three Percenters, a decentralized, national militia movement that the Southern Poverty Law Center categorizes as anti-government extremists.\n\nTheir online empire is large. Another Parazzo site, Flag and Cross is listed as the administrator of another Facebook page, United States Constitution, which has 1.2 million followers.\n\nA Guardian review of that site\u2019s content shows a similar pattern of linking to Porrazzo-connected websites, and warnings of civil war stretching back to the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nBecca Lewis researches online extremism and disinformation at Stanford University. In a telephone conversation, she said that the page and the associated websites represented a sophisticated effort to skirt Facebook\u2019s fact-checking efforts.\n\n\u201cIt seems as though they are being very strategic in their messaging so as to not be shut down,\u201d Lewis said, adding that viewing the ostentatious labeling of opinion as an effort to sidestep fact-checking is \u201cabsolutely a reasonable assumption\u201d.\n\nIn June, Heated reported that climate change deniers were exploiting the same loophole to \u201cmake any climate disinformation ineligible for fact-checking by deeming it \u201copinion\u201d. In August, NBC reported that Facebook had systematically relaxed its fact-checking rules for conservative outlets and personalities.\n\nIn a telephone conversation, Dino Porrazzo Jr asserted that PTTAB had had \u201czero fact-check violations\u201d, characterizing his websites as \u201copinion websites based on fact\u201d. Asked if they were fact-checked at all, Porrazzo said \u201cno\u201d, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t work at Facebook\u201d. Asked if he thought that there really was a civil war coming, Porrazzo accused the Guardian of \u201cwriting a hit piece to get me thrown off Facebook\u201d, and then ended the conversation.\n\nFacebook Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Porrazzos also have links to Republican officials.\n\nThe registered agent for the company is an elected official in California, Ensen Mason, who was elected as San Bernardino county auditor-controller in California as a nonpartisan candidate, but who is listed as a member of the San Bernardino Republican party.\n\nIn an email, however, Ensen Mason said that in relation to the Porrazzos, his accounting firm\u2019s role \u201cis strictly limited to accounting services and registered agent\u201d.\n\nThe Vici Media Group, meanwhile, is run by Patrick Mauldin, who is a social media consultant for the Trump campaign and other Republican politicians, and his brother, Ryan.\n\nThe company was hired in 2016 by one-time Trump campaign manager and recently-resigned campaign consultant, Brad Parscale, to be part of the team that was widely credited with winning Trump the election. In June, Patrick Mauldin was identified as the creator of a fake Joe Biden site that was compared in New York Times reporting to \u201cdisinformation spread by Russian trolls\u201d.\n\nIn an email, Ryan Mauldin disavowed the Porrazzos\u2019 publishing output, writing, \u201cVici Media Group was engaged for a small, non-content-related project by the managers of the page.\u201d\n\nMauldin added, \u201cWe have no input on the content published by the various sites or the comments made on that content. We are not working for the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nMauldin did not immediately respond to attempts to further clarify the nature of their work for the Porrazzos, and to clarify New York Times reporting as recent as June 2020 that said Patrick Mauldin was on a retainer for the Trump campaign, and considered a \u201crising star\u201d.\n\nPorrazzo refused to specify the nature of AFF\u2019s relationship with Vici Media Group.\n\nMeanwhile, the content of the Porrazzo pages does appear to trigger extreme responses among users. Hundreds of user comments on the page\u2019s posts suggest the use of violence against perceived political enemies. On a 5 September post linking to a Right Wing Tribune article suggesting that Democrats will foment civil war if Biden loses, one user commented, \u201ca short civil war with the democrats and those who support socialist policies will go a long way to help Make America Great Again\u201d.\n\nAnother connects civil war to their belief that a Trump loss is impossible, writing \u201cIf [Biden] wins, it\u2019ll be from fraud on an industrial scale, and the lesson that\u2019ll have to be taught for that will necessarily be no less industrial.\u201d\n\nMany welcome the prospect of armed conflict \u2013 one writes \u201cThat\u2019s fine with me open season on democrats!\u201d. Another deployed accused murderer Kyle Rittenhouse as a positive example, writing \u201cI think it will be more whining, crying, rioting, looting and a lot of Kyles protecting their cities, towns and neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nAsked to comment on the site\u2019s apparent reach, and the nature of its community, Lewis, the extremism researcher, said: \u201cThis is not some dark corner of the internet, this is not a fringe thing, it\u2019s mainstream Republicans that are stoking this.\u201d\n\nOn links to the Trump campaign, she said that the distorted content and the violent user comments formed a kind of \u201cfeedback loop\u201d, and that \u201cTrump and his campaign staff have been masters at exploiting these feedback loops\u201d.\n\nOn Tuesday night, meanwhile, following the Guardian\u2019s outreach to the Porrazzos and Facebook that day, Dino Porrazzo announced on Twitter that he \u201cHAD TO DELETE A FEW ARTICLES I WROTE TODAY BECAUSE THEY WERE DEMED FALSE BY BASEMENT DWELLING LIBERAL FACT CHECKERS\u201d.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/avengers-endgame-directors-break-silence-martin-scorsese-attack-1255560", "authors": ["Aaron Couch", "Aaron.Couch Thr.Com", "Graeme Mcmillan", "Rick Porter", "Borys Kit", "Pamela Mcclintock", "Richard New", "Umber Bhatti", "Jean Bentley", "The Associated Press"], "title": "'Avengers' Directors on '21 Bridges' and Scorsese Attack: \"Nobody Owns Cinema\"", "text": "\"Ultimately, we define cinema as a film that can bring people together to have a shared, emotional experience,\" Joe tells The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Russos grew up devouring genre movies and art house films alike. They would frequent their local art house theater in Cleveland and spend hours debating the merits of the films they saw. The siblings would also stay up late on Saturdays to watch late-night genre movies with their father, devouring films like The French Connection and The Taking of Pelham 123, both of which they cite as inspirations for 21 Bridges.\n\n\"When we look at the box office [of] Avengers: Endgame, we don't see that as a signifier of financial success, we see it as a signifier of emotional success,\" says Joe of the film, which earned $2.78 billion globally. \"It's a movie that had an unprecedented impact on audiences around the world in the way that they shared that narrative and the way that they experienced it. And the emotions they felt watching it.\"\n\nScorsese has noted that he has tried to watch a few Marvel films, but quickly abandoned them. The Russos note it's challenging to have a dialogue about cinema if the acclaimed director hasn't seen the films he is talking about.\n\n\"But, at the end of the day, what do we know?\" Joe says, jokingly. \"We're just two guys from Cleveland, Ohio, and 'cinema' is a New York word. In Cleveland, we call them movies.\"\n\nAdds Anthony: \"The other way to think about it, too, is nobody owns cinema. We don't own cinema. You don't own cinema. Scorsese doesn't own cinema.\"\n\nDirected by Brian Kirk, 21 Bridges centers on police detective Andre Davis (Boseman), who shuts down the island of Manhattan after eight police officers are gunned down during a robbery gone wrong. With the film, the Russos found themselves juggling producing duties while also directing 2018's Avengers: Infinity War and April's Avengers: Endgame.\n\n\"You are stepping off during setups on Avengers to take a phone call to deal with production issues on a movie like 21 Bridges,\" explains Joe. \"At the end of the day, irrespective of how much of an energy drain it may be on you, we couldn't be happier with the film.\"\n\nThe Russo brothers famously cast Boseman as Black Panther in Captain America: Civil War via a conference call which saw the actor pulled off a red carpet and ushered into a car to hear about the role from the Marvel Studios team. A few short years later, Boseman had led Black Panther to more than $1.34 billion at the global box office. After Black Panther's success, he had his pick of projects and chose to jump aboard 21 Bridges.\n\n\"We didn't really come at it as something we had to sell him on. It was a project that we really believed in and were creatively excited by,\" Anthony says of bringing the project to Boseman. \"We knew we had something special in Andre Davis, in that character. We knew it was something Chadwick might respond to.\"\n\nFor the film's antagonists, the team brought on board Taylor Kitsch and Stephan James. Both characters have mysterious pasts, and James' character in particular resonated with test audiences.\n\n\"When we are casting characters who are very morally complicated ... we look to actors who have a really high level of charisma,\" says Anthony. \"That helps us balance the storytelling in terms of how the audience is receiving these ideas.\"\n\nThough the Russos have closed out a chapter of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Avengers: Endgame, they continue to work with actors from their past, via their AGBO banner.\n\nThe brothers are currently directing Cherry, which stars Spider-Man actor Tom Holland as an Army medic who finds himself addicted to opioids after returning home with PTSD and who begins robbing banks. They are also producing the Netflix action movie Dhaka, with Thor star Chris Hemsworth. Numerous members of the 21 Bridges team comes from their Marvel movies, as well.\n\n\"Part of why we do this is we grew up in a big, Italian family in Cleveland, Ohio,\" says Joe. \"And we like to create a big extended work family that we can work with over and over again.\"", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://esportsinsider.com/2020/04/valorant-initial-esports-plans/", "authors": ["Adam Fitch"], "title": "Riot Games unveils initial approach to esports for VALORANT", "text": "Riot Games has released its initial esports plans for its free-to-play first-person shooter title, VALORANT.\n\nThe developer has unveiled the core pillars of its efforts and community competition guidelines.\n\nRELATED: Riot Games announces Teamfight Tactics: Galaxy Championship\n\nRiot Games claims competitive integrity, accessibility, and authenticity are at the forefront of its plans for VALORANT\u2019s competitive endeavours.

Ford", "Jeff Carlisle", "Sam Borden", "Jonathan Johnson", "Associated Press", "Melissa Reddy", "Jason Davis", "Simon Kuper", "Mark Ogden", "Tom Marshall"], "title": "Why you won't see Ada Hegerberg, the world's best player, at the Women's World Cup", "text": "It has been two years since striker Ada Hegerberg, 23, informed the Norwegian soccer federation that she would not play for her national team until she saw more tangible progress toward equal working conditions and overall support for the women's program. She has never wavered in that decision, despite some initiatives by Norwegian officials, and will watch the 2019 Women's World Cup from home this summer.\n\nBut it won't be a vacation, as she told ESPN.com senior writer Bonnie D. Ford earlier this year. Hegerberg's incandescent talent -- honed by her five seasons with superclub Olympique Lyonnais and her solo workouts during breaks for international play -- have lifted her to the top of the game, embodied when she hoisted the inaugural women's Ballon d'Or trophy last year. That was before she scored a hat trick within 17 minutes in May to secure Lyon's fourth consecutive Champions League title.\n\nESPN: Given that there isn't salary parity between men and women, what are the most important details here [in Lyon] that make you feel as if you're being treated equally?\n\nHEGERBERG: It's the amount of respect and the fact that we're equal in terms of conditions, the pitches we have, eating in the same canteen and really taking a part in the club together with the men's team. People stay here a long time because they love it, they actually have a comfortable life here, and they can live from football and compete at the highest level.\n\nThere are some countries with very strong clubs, such as France, that have not succeeded in the World Cup. The United States? Total opposite: great success in the World Cup, and our club system has struggled. Why do you think there's that disconnect?\n\nIn the U.S., they have spent so much more time together in the national team rather than the club. Here it's different. You have your everyday life in the club, and then you go to the national team maybe once every second month. I've heard a lot of people talking about how big the World Cup is going to be, and I really hope that happens. But we forget the fact that you have all the interest in a big tournament, then suddenly, bam! You go back to your club, and you have, like, 200 people watching your games. So bringing the buzz from big tournaments into your everyday club life, getting people to show up at your games, that's important. For example, when we played the final of the 2013 Euros [in Sweden], we played in front of 40,000 people, and some players from Norway were playing in league games the weekend after in front of, like, 200 people. It was a shock -- for everyone.\n\nWhat gave you the mental and emotional strength to make the decision to not play with Norway?\n\nI'm in a club that has standards, and I'm used to that. My family, we're all about quality, so I put the bar quite high. I demand a lot of things from myself, but then I also demand that everything should be in place around me so that we can succeed.\n\nI was trying to make an impact [on Norway] for a lot of years, and I could see that in this system, in the federation, it didn't fit me at all. I feel like I was placed in a system where I didn't have a voice. I felt this weight on my shoulders more and more: This isn't working. When you're quite sure about yourself and the values and where you want to go, it's easy to make difficult choices. For me at that point, being able not to lose myself and not to lose what I believe in, I had to take that choice. I couldn't go any other way. And as soon as I did it, it was like [exhales], I could be myself again. I could perform on the highest level again.\n\nBut those weeks in front of that decision were almost like a depression. It was such a hard thing to do. It can't be easy when a woman stands and tries to be critical in a positive way. For me, it was really important that [the federation] knew what I was talking about, point by point. When the media asked me what I told the federation, I said, that's between me and them so they can work on it. But it doesn't seem like they took it in the way they should have. Ever since, I just put that behind me and try to perform at the highest level with Lyon.\n\n-- Who will rule the Women's World Cup?\n\n-- How Bob Marley's daughter saved Jamaican women's soccer\n\n-- Which Aussie rules football? It's the unstoppable Sam Kerr\n\n-- Women's World Cup team preview: Norway\n\nThen in a cosmic coincidence, Norway winds up in the same group as France. Do you think you'll follow it closely?\n\nI'm going to watch the World Cup, no doubt. I've got a lot of teammates playing. But there's no emotional connection. I'm totally confident with my decision since day one. It took me to the highest levels, the Ballon d'Or.\n\nI saw the Ballon d'Or trophy downstairs in the club museum. Was it hard for you to give it up?\n\nI was just so afraid of keeping it at my place. I'm going to let it stay here for some time, and one day I'll bring it home when I get a proper alarm.\n\nHow do you view what the U.S. players are doing, suing their federation for equal pay?\n\nThey've got the guts, and they're together about it. That's the next thing. Women need to back women in cases like this, even more than we do today. If each woman stands up and uses her voice, imagine how many voices would be together and how strong a mass that would be. And I feel that responsibility myself as well. Even though sometimes I would be like, [sighs] \"Am I really going to take on that fight?\" I would always think, but what will it bring for the future, for others? That's in the back in my head, behind every decision I make. I got this question from a journalist as well: Do you consider yourself a football player or a feminist?\n\nWhy do you have to choose?\n\nYeah! It's impossible to play football in a world among men and not fight for equality. We're all feminists. Playing football can be damn harsh, but every day is a fight for equality. That's a fact. We've made it here [in Lyon] because you've got one man at the top believing in us. But it's still a long, long way to go, and you can see it in small examples every day.\n\nWe're still in a time when an insult to a woman can gain more attention than an accomplishment. There's the question [about twerking] you were asked at the Ballon d'Or presentation.\n\nI didn't take it as sexist. I just thought it was a really stupid question at a really stupid time. If he'd asked M'bappe that question, they would be like, what is he doing?\n\nIt put you in an impossible situation. If you don't say anything, you're not strong enough, and if you react strongly, you're too strong.\n\nExactly. You can't say anything without getting consequences. But I always have humor for it as well. You should have balance between humor and what's not acceptable.\n\nIt's tiring, right?\n\nSometimes I would call my mom, and I would be so angry. That doesn't happen that often, but sometimes you see stuff even outside football, and it just goes into me at a certain moment, and it's like, why? Where is this going to end? Is there a better future? But then I get a grip, and it's like [exhales], let's go again.\n\nYou have a lot of years ahead. It's not like it's the end of your career -- knock on wood.\n\nYeah. [Laughs] But seriously, I want to show what I'm good at, on the pitch and outside the pitch. I never considered myself less worthy than a man in football. Never. Never, never, never. It's all about changing attitudes.\n\nI understand you like biographies. What's the last one you read?\n\nIt was about Muhammad Ali.\n\nWhat did you get from that book?\n\nHe was a hard-working man. I try to read a lot of women's biographies as well because I think there are a lot more women out there who are like Alis.\n\nWhat keeps you hungry?\n\nImproving. And winning. The way I work, I always ask myself: What did go well this year, and what do we need to work on? I always have a plan in my head. I do it with my crew at home, my family and my fianc\u00e9, a physical coach, a mental coach. It's demanding sometimes, even when it goes well. So when the Ballon d'Or came, it was like \"Hallelujah!\" That was the timing I needed.\n\nThe joy of repeating is quite different from the joy of doing something for the first time.\n\nMy motivation is staying at the top as long as possible. I know that I'm capable of it. I've had some years at the top now, but I know I can continue if I do things right.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://news.yahoo.com/apple-just-released-ios-12-170154087.html", "authors": ["Zach Epstein"], "title": "Apple just released iOS 12.4 for the iPhone and iPad", "text": "Click here to read the full article.\n\nIt might not be quite as exciting as Apple\u2019s iOS 13 beta, but the company just pushed out a new software update for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. iOS 12.4 comes about two months after the initial release of iOS 12.3, and it mainly focuses on bug fixes and other refinements.

And now, as of Friday, Sept. 13 at 5 a.m. PT/8 a.m. ET, you can finally preorder them. The new iPhones will arrive in stores (and to the first customers who've preordered) on Friday, Sept. 20. (Apple also announced that iOS 13 will be available on Sept. 19.)\n\nThis is the first time in recent memory that the start time has been during daylight hours. Previously, it was midnight PT/3 a.m. ET. And, with presumably more people awake to order, the vendor sites are doing their best to keep up. As of 5:15 a.m. PT, Apple and Verizon were working smoothly for us, while AT&T and Sprint put us into a timed \"wait page\" for a few minutes. T-Mobile's site didn't yet have a link to complete the order, but offers a phone number you can call.\n\nOverall, the ordering process has been smooth, in contrast to past years when the flood of requests tended to bring down the carrier site. Also, there haven't been many delays, although 256GB iPhone 11 Pro units for various carriers have their arrival date pushed back to as far out as Oct. 11. Sprint's page shows the iPhone 11 Pro Max shipping in October too. Most iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max units on Apple's site say they'll ship on time, although some versions of the Max have been pushed back to Oct. 1.\n\nWe'll continue to monitor uptime at the vendors.

And a survey of US adults shows that few understand the link between HPV and cancer.\n\nPublished online today in Pediatrics, the snapshot of HPV vaccine practices and experiences of among 302 pediatricians and 228 family physicians (FPs) finds that many doctors likely hinder uptake by being less than ideally assertive when raising the issue of HPV vaccination with parents of adolescent patients.\n\nWhat's lacking is a \"presumptive\" style, in which the doctor makes an announcement that assumes parents are ready to vaccinate their children, vs a conversational style that engages parents in an open-ended discussion. Although the former approach has been shown to increase vaccination in young adolescents, doctors may fear pushback from their parents.\n\n\"Although most physicians recommend the HPV vaccine for patients 11 to 12 years old, many are not using a presumptive style when introducing the HPV vaccine, standing orders, or electronic alerts for HPV delivery,\" write Allison Kempe, MD, MPH, of the Adult and Child Consortium for Health Outcomes Research and Delivery Science at the University of Colorado in Aurora, and colleagues.\n\nAccording to the email survey, conducted from July to September 2018 as part of the Vaccine Policy Collaborative Initiative, pediatricians are more assertive than FPs in strongly recommending the vaccine: 65% of pediatricians vs 42% of FPs reported they \"almost always\" or \"always\" use a presumptive style. By contrast, 16% of pediatricians and 24% of family physicians said they almost always or always use a conversational style when bringing up the issue.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics advises pediatricians to give a strong recommendation for vaccination worded in a presumptive style.\n\n\"I was not very surprised at the results because back when the vaccine was introduced, it was presented not as a 'cancer vaccine' but in the context of sexual activity, which I think was a big mistake,\" Kempe told Medscape Medical News. \"But you want to give this vaccine well before sexual activity begins and when children are younger and have a better immune response.\"\n\nThe survey's results may help explain the 2018 National Immunization Survey\u2013Teen findings that HPV vaccine initiation among US adolescents aged 13 to 17 years was 69.9% for girls and 66.3% for boys, while series completion was only 53.7% for girls and 48.7% for boys.\n\n\"Doctors probably overestimate parental pushback and don't make their vaccination recommendations strong enough,\" said Kempe. \"They should not single out the HPV vaccine to parents but include it with the meningococcal and Tdap vaccines that are routinely given to 11- and 12-year-olds \u2014 in the same way and on the same day.\"\n\nRecommending the Vaccine\n\nThe survey also showed that the proportion of physicians who reported they strongly recommend the HPV vaccine varies by patient age and sex. For example, 99% of pediatricians strongly recommend it for female patients age 15 years or older but only 83% do for male patients ages 11 to 12 years. For family physicians, the rates were lower, ranging from 90% for girls 15 years or older to 66% for boys 11 to 12 years (P < .0001 between specialties).\n\nYet the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has routinely recommended HPV vaccination for adolescents at 11 to 12 years since 2006 for girls and since 2011 for boys, the authors note. And a recent meta-analysis found compelling evidence that the vaccine reduces HPV infections, high-grade cervical lesions, and anogenital warts in young people of both sexes, although it is too early to gauge the impact on cervical cancers. Nevertheless, as of 2015 the majority of countries were vaccinating girls only.\n\nVaccine Refusal\n\nReported rates of refusal or deferral for 11- to 12- year-olds were high in the survey, though lower for older adolescents. FPs reported higher rates than pediatricians at all patient ages, and both specialties were significantly more likely to report refusal/deferral for boys than girls.\n\nFor example, the proportion of pediatricians reporting a > 50% deferral/refusal rate for the 11-to-12 age group was 19% for girls vs 23% for boys. Among FPs, the rates were 27% and 36%, respectively.\n\nThe expectation of parental resistance affects physicians' behavior, Kempe and associates note, and those who have experienced or anticipate high rates of deferral/refusal may adjust the strength and style of their recommendations. \"Such accommodations by physicians may perpetuate a lack of acceptance of the HPV vaccine among parents,\" the authors write.\n\nIn multivariable regression, refusal or deferral was associated with the following physician variables:\n\n\u2022 not strongly recommending the HPV vaccine for the 11-to-12 age group\n\n\u2022 not using a presumptive style\n\n\u2022 perceiving less resistance when introducing the HPV vaccine to a 13-year-old patient vs a younger one\n\n\u2022 anticipating an uncomfortable conversation when recommending the HPV vaccine for a patient 11 or 12 years old\n\n\"Greater physician awareness about the potential of overestimating the degree of parental resistance to HPV vaccination and about the effectiveness of a strong recommendation for the HPV vaccine, delivered in the same way as for other adolescent vaccines and on the same day as other adolescent vaccines, may be key to increasing acceptance among parents of 11- to 12-year-old patients,\" the authors write.\n\nVaccine Practices\n\nAccording to the results, 40% of physicians report using standing orders for HPV vaccination, 66% use a computer-based system identifying adolescents who need to be vaccinated, and 42% have an electronic alert in medical records. No significant differences emerged by specialty.\n\nIn support of the now recommended two-dose schedule for younger adolescents, most doctors said it is translating to higher completion rates. But physicians, especially FPs, were often in error or unaware of the number of doses recommended in different scenarios or the proper timing for offering additional vaccination with 9 valent HPV.\n\nRegarding dosing intervals, 74% of pediatricians reported routinely recommending the second HPV dose 6 months after the first, with 25% routinely recommending it at 12 months. Among FPs, corresponding percentages were 88% at 6 months and 12% at 12 months (P < .0001). National guidelines support either interval.\n\nOpposition to Vaccination\n\nWhen asked about major barriers to vaccination, misinformation from the Internet or social media was the most commonly cited (63% of pediatricians, 44% of FPs). Other frequently cited barriers included parental concerns about the vaccine's safety (45% and 24%, respectively), considering the vaccine unnecessary for sons (28% and 27%), moral or religious reasons (24% and 28%).\n\nFew physicians (less than 14%) in either specialty cited parental concern that getting the HPV vaccine would encourage premature or risky sexual behavior.\n\nPublic Awareness Lacking\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan Suk, MS, of the UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston, Texas, and colleagues report that fewer than 30% of US adults know HPV causes anal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers.\n\nPublished online today in JAMA Pediatrics, Suk and colleagues analyzed responses from 2564 men and 3697 women who responded to the 2017 Health Information National Trend Survey. They report that men were considerably less knowledgeable than women about HPV across all age groups.\n\nAmong young adults aged 18 to 26 who have been eligible for the vaccine, 53.6% of men and 80.3% of women knew about the HPV virus; about half (52.7%) of the men and 79.0% of women knew about the HPV vaccine.\n\nIn the newly vaccine-approved 27-to-45 age group, fewer than half of men and women were aware the virus causes anal, penile, and oral cancers. Again, awareness was lower among men than women: 67.7% vs 86.4% for HPV awareness, and for vaccination 56.1% vs 81%.\n\nSimilar gaps in knowledge and differences between the sexes were observed in respondents 46 and older.\n\n\"In particular, the lack of HPV knowledge among adults aged 27 to 45 years and 46 years and older is concerning given that adults in these age groups are (or will likely be) the parents responsible for making HPV vaccination decisions for their children,\" the authors write.\n\nIn addition, the study found that only 19% of men and 31.5% of women who were of vaccine-eligible age (or had vaccine-eligible family members) had received a recommendation for HPV vaccination from their healthcare providers.\n\n\"Future work to eliminate current communication barriers and improve provider and patient and parent communication could help rapidly increase vaccination uptake,\" the study's corresponding author, Ashish A. Deshmuhk, PhD, MPH, of UTHealth School of Public Health, told Medscape Medical News.\n\nThe study by Kempe et al was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.\n\nThe study by Suk et al was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health. Deshmukh has reported consulting fees from Merck outside the submitted work.\n\nPediatrics. Published online September 16, 2019. Abstract\n\nJAMA Pediatrics . Published online September 16, 2019.

(1:10)\n\nPittsburgh Pirates pitcher Felipe Vazquez was arrested Tuesday in Pittsburgh and is being charged with multiple felonies in both Pennsylvania and Florida, including statutory sexual assault.\n\nVazquez was initially charged with \"computer pornography/soliciting a child\" and \"providing obscene material to minors\" by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.\n\nHe was arraigned Tuesday afternoon in Pittsburgh and was denied bail, with the judge saying she was told that additional charges were expected.\n\nVazquez was subsequently charged in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, with three felonies -- statutory sexual assault of a minor 11 years or older; unlawful contact with a minor; and corruption of minors -- as well as one misdemeanor, indecent assault of a person less than 16 years old.\n\nThe FDLE issued a statement saying it began its investigation into Vazquez in August after obtaining information that he reportedly had a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old girl in Lee County, Florida. The girl, now 15, allegedly was continuing to have a relationship with Vazquez via text messaging and received a video from him in July in which he is shown performing a sex act, according to the police statement.\n\nThe police affidavit says the girl's mother found texts, photographs and the video sent by Vazquez to her daughter. On July 23, the mother \"sent a text message, to include a screenshot of the photographs\" to Vazquez to inform him that her daughter was a minor.\n\nVazquez has been put on administrative leave by Major League Baseball, though sources told ESPN that the league is not launching an immediate investigation because it plans to use the police's findings in pursuing potential discipline for Vazquez.\n\n\"Today we were made aware of an active law enforcement investigation involving Felipe Vazquez and his subsequent arrest,\" Pirates president Frank Coonelly said in a statement. \"We take this matter, and these charges in particular, extremely seriously. We have informed the Commissioner's Office of the investigation and arrest.\n\n\"The Commissioner's Office will immediately place Felipe Vazquez on Administrative Leave (and, as a result, Restricted List) pursuant to the Joint MLB/MLBPA Policy. We need to be respectful to all involved and the ongoing legal proceeding. As a result, the organization, our staff and players cannot comment any further at this time.\"\n\nThe arrest was made by the FDLE with assistance from the Pennsylvania State Police. Several electronic devices were seized by police and will be examined as part of the investigation, with more charges possible for Vazquez.\n\nThe arrest warrant was issued in Lee County, Florida. Vazquez is in the Allegheny County Jail in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe administrative leave is pursuant to MLB's joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy. A player can remain on leave up to seven days, but it can be extended if MLB and the MLB Players Association agree to it.\n\nPirates manager Clint Hurdle said he and team management met with players before Tuesday night's game against Seattle.\n\n\"We talked about a lot of different emotions that were stirred up today in a lot of different places,\" Hurdle said, \"and how do we connect and support our way through those emotions. How do we continue to find ways to improve and hold ourselves to a high standard on and off the field. And what can we do from an organizational standpoint to help with any questions, any thoughts.\"\n\nVazquez, the Pirates' closer, is 5-1 with 28 saves, 90 strikeouts and a 1.65 ERA this season. He is a two-time All-Star selection and is signed with the Pirates through at least 2021.\n\nVazquez will be paid while on administrative leave, but the Pirates could attempt to void his contract. However, past efforts by teams to nullify deals, even in cases of illegal behavior, have proven difficult. He is owed $5.25 million for the 2020 season and $7.25 million for 2021. The Pirates also hold $10 million options on the 2022 and '23 seasons -- the first with a $1 million buyout and the second a $500,000 buyout.\n\nVazquez was among the most sought-after players before the July 31 trade deadline, with multiple teams pursuing him. The Pirates held out for an enormous asking price, valuing Vazquez -- and especially the four years of team control -- as one of the best assets in baseball. Teams found the Pirates' demands exorbitant, and Vazquez remained with Pittsburgh.\n\nESPN's Jeff Passan and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/10/fed-insurance-rate-cuts-while-the-economy-is-fine-usually-boost-the-stock-market-history-shows.html", "authors": ["Kate Rooney"], "title": "Fed 'insurance' rate cuts while the economy is fine usually boost the stock market, history shows", "text": "When the central bank cuts interest rates as a preventative measure, U.S. equity markets have historically done very well.\n\nSo-called \"insurance \" rate cuts with a backdrop of strong growth \u2014 which happened in 1995 and 1998 \u2014 resulted in solid equity market performance, according to analysis by J.P. Morgan. But not all rate cuts are created equal. The stock market reaction depends on the justification for slashing rates.\n\n\"If the reason is weakening growth then this is not a good environment for equities overall, especially cyclical sectors, even as defensive and bond like equities do relatively well in such environment,\" J.P. Morgan global markets strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note to clients Monday.\n\nJ.P. Morgan pointed out three \"insurance cut\" easing cycles in 1980, 1995 and 1998 that appear to be outliers. The late 1990s rate cuts were used as insurance against Mexican and Russian default and collapse of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management at the time, bolstered the equity market. The only other time the S&P 500 saw stronger performance following a rate cut was in 1980. At the time, there was an 8.5% reduction in the Fed funds rate from 20% to 11.5% \u2014 a level of monetary easing that is \"obviously not possible in the current conjuncture,\" Panigirtzoglou said.\n\nThe overall trajectory of equity markets following the first Fed rate cut has been predominantly negative. Distinguishing which type of easing cycle 2019 will turn out to be \"is the challenge for equity markets going forward,\" he said. For now, markets appear to be assuming that Federal Reserve officials' dovish comments are signs of a preemptive, rather than reactive move.\n\nInvestors have been focused on the likelihood of an \"insurance\" interest-rate cut this year. That would theoretically provide a buffer against any economic weakness caused by an ongoing trade war and tariffs with China.\n\nWeaker employment data last week added to the investors' hopes of a rate cut. The economy added only 75,000 jobs in May, less than half of what economists had expected. Now that the job market is showing signs of strain, economists and investors now firmly believe the Federal Reserve will move to cut rates this year. The market is now pricing in a 95 percent chance of a quarter-point cut in July, according to BMO rate strategist Jon Hill. The Fed next meets June 18-19 and July 30-31.\n\nOn the other hand, if the central bank ends up being \"reactive,\" markets may not see the same benefits, Panigirtzoglou said. This could play out if the Federal Reserve decides to wait until later in the year, or it proves to be \"too late\" and the U.S. economy has already entered a weak phase, he said.\n\n\"Then the equity market could follow a weak trajectory similar to more typical previous Fed easing cycles rather than the strong trajectory seen during 1995 or 1998,\" Panigirtzoglou said.\n\nOther asset classes have mixed reactions. U.S.Treasury have historically rallied, and the curve continued to steepen for up to six months on average after a Fed rate cut. The dollar rallied for up to three months, but eventually tended to give up previous gains, according to the J.P. Morgan analysis.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Patti Domm and Jeff Cox contributed reporting.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/watch-california-gov-gavin-newsom-and-fire-officials-give-updates-on-wildfires-aug-21", "authors": ["Pueng Vongs", "Online Producer", "Pueng Vongs Is A Digital Producer", "Writer For The Bay Area News Group."], "title": "Watch: California Gov.

National Security Council personnel edited a memo written about the call. White House lawyers, according to a government whistleblower , directed that the memo be uploaded into a highly restricted classified computer network. And there were the staffers whose keystrokes on a computer made that happen.\n\nThey represent a universe of people, little known outside their vital circle of national security officials, who can either support or disavow the whistleblower's account. Their roles could well become more public as the impeachment investigation unfolds and Congress seeks additional witnesses.\n\nSome staffers involved with the call still work at the White House; others have left. But what was thought to be a routine conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy turned into anything but that, when Trump asked him to investigate Ukraine's involvement in the 2016 presidential election and the activities of Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nThere were dozens of ears listening to President Donald Trump's 30-minute phone call with the leader of Ukraine that is at the center of a House impeachment inquiry\n\n30 MINUTES THAT CHANGED THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY\n\nBy the time staffers in the Situation Room got the president of Ukraine on the phone at 9:03 a.m., Trump had just finished firing off tweets claiming complete vindication from former special counsel Robert Mueller's congressional testimony the day before about the Russia investigation. On the call, Trump was first to speak. He showered the 41-year-old Ukrainian, a novice politician and former comedian, with praise following his party's victory in parliamentary elections. Zelenskiy chatted about how he wanted to 'drain the swamp' in Kyiv and how he wished the European Union would provide more financial support. He told Trump that Ukraine was ready to buy more Javelin anti-tank missiles from the United States.\n\nThe next 10 words that came out of Trump's mouth \u2014 'I would like you to do us a favor, though' \u2014 are what triggered the House impeachment inquiry that has imperiled his presidency.\n\nTrump asked Zelenskiy to work with Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to look into Biden and his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nTrump was heard to tell President Volodymyr Zelensky: 'I would like you to do us a favor'\n\nTrump says it was an innocent, 'perfect' call. But some White House staffers, worried that Trump seemed to be asking Ukraine for dirt on Biden, sounded alarms. They suggested the memorandum of the call \u2014 'telcon' for short \u2014 be transferred into a restricted server, usually reserved for documents about covert operations.\n\nBEFORE THE CALL\n\nThis call, as well as others Trump has had with foreign leaders, was unusual in other ways, too. In past administrations, top foreign policy officials routinely briefed a president in person right before a call and provided written materials as well.\n\nA former U.S. ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul worked at the NSC during the Obama administration and helped write briefs to prepare for dozens of calls with Russian leaders, including Vladimir Putin.\n\n'Judging from the content of the Trump-Zelenskiy call, Trump was not reading talking points,' McFaul said. 'No one on our team ever would have prepared a call package prompting Obama to ask for a personal favor that would help him win reelection. I also doubt that Trump's NSC staff would have written or cleared such a talking point for their boss.'\n\nOne individual with firsthand knowledge of how the Trump calls with foreign leaders are handled said the president 'hates' such 'pre-briefs' and frequently has refused to do them. Trump doesn't like written background materials either, preferring to handle the calls himself, often in the morning from the residence. Occasionally, while on the phone with foreign heads of state, Trump has handed the receiver to his daughter, Ivanka Trump, so she can talk with the leader, according to this individual.\n\nThe person said a six-page pre-brief with attachments was once prepared for Trump before a call to a foreign leader. But that turned out to be too long, as did a single-page version. Preparing pre-brief note cards that offered about three talking points for Trump to make on a call was the norm, according to this person, who feared retribution for describing this process and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe individual said that when Trump is done with the note cards, he often rips them up and tosses them in a burn bag. Staff who handle records have had to retrieve the burn bags from the residence, put the papers out on a table and tape them back together to preserve them as official presidential records, this person said.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo and Keith Kellogg, national security adviser for Vice President Mike Pence, were also on the call\n\nRUN OF THE MILL\n\nCalls between a president and a foreign leader typically start with U.S. intelligence officers detailed to the White House gathering in the Situation Room, a process that has been in place for decades, according to two people familiar with the operation in the Trump White House and past administrations. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss how Trump's calls with foreign heads of state are handled.\n\nDuring the Ukraine call, several others listened in. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Keith Kellogg, national security adviser for Vice President Mike Pence, were on the call. It's unclear if they were at the White House or listened in on 'drop' lines, secure hookups top officials can use from outside the White House.\n\nOthers who typically would have listened in would have been the president's national security adviser, John Bolton, or his deputy, Charles Kupperman, who have both left the White House; the NSC's director of Russia and Europe, who currently is Tim Morrison; the NSC's Ukraine expert; and possibly someone from White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's office.\n\nLawyers who handle NSC issues include John Eisenberg and his deputy, Michael Ellis. It's unclear what, if any, role Ellis played, but the former counsel for the House Intelligence Committee has been in the spotlight before.\n\nThe New York Times reported in March 2017 that he allowed his former boss, the then-committee chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., to review classified material at the White House, seeking to bolster Trump's claim that he was wiretapped during the 2016 campaign on the orders of the Obama administration. The intelligence reports consisted primarily of ambassadors and other foreign officials talking about trying to develop contacts in the inner circle of then President-elect Trump. The report was not confirmed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe NSC declined to confirm who was on the call.\n\nDown in the Situation Room, several others would have been listening. One person monitors the call to make sure the line is not interrupted. Others are tasked with documenting what is said. No audio recordings are made. The memorandum of the call, the telcon, which the White House has released, is the closest thing to a word-for-word transcript that is produced and is the official presidential record of the conversation.\n\n'When I got to the Situation Room and my predecessor explained this incredibly inefficient process that we use, I had a lot of questions,' said Larry Pfeiffer, a 30-year U.S. intelligence veteran who managed the Situation Room during the Obama years. 'I said 'Why don't we just record the call and write a transcript based on that?'\n\nThe White House stopped taping presidential calls in the 1970s when President Nixon recorded 3,700 hours of conversations and transcript\n\nPfeiffer said his predecessor told him that the White House stopped taping presidential calls in the 1970s when President Richard Nixon recorded 3,700 hours of conversations, transcripts of which were used by Watergate investigators and during impeachment hearings that followed.\n\nPfeiffer said White House lawyers finally approved the idea of having a duty officer, wearing a headset, sit in a separate room, and repeat what was said on the call into voice-to-text software \u2014 again without creating any audio recording.\n\nIndividuals familiar with Trump White House procedure say one Situation Room staffer, using voice-to-text software, repeats each word the president says and another listens and repeats what the foreign leader says. The software turns the words they repeat into text and a rough draft of the telcon is produced.\n\nThat draft is given to subject matter specialists on the NSC, who edit the draft for accuracy. Each draft is separately preserved. After it's finalized, it's turned over to the national security adviser \u2014 Bolton, at the time \u2014 or the deputy, who was Kupperman, for their approval. White House lawyers also play a role in approving NSC documents.\n\nAfter that, the telcon is given back to staffers tasked with preserving the document as a presidential record.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWER SOUNDS OFF\n\nSomewhere during this sequence, people privy to the call questioned whether Trump was pressuring the Ukrainian leader to investigate the Bidens. Trump has denied that he did and publicly released the telcon recounting what was said on the call.\n\nHe released it after a whistleblower, a CIA officer, filed a complaint about the call with the intelligence community's inspector general. 'In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials that senior White House officials had intervened to lock down' all records of the phone call, the whistleblower wrote. 'This set of actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call.'\n\nThe unidentified whistleblower \u2014 one of two who have come forward \u2014 said White House lawyers directed that the telcon be taken off a computer server where classified documents on foreign leader calls are normally kept. They directed it be transferred to a computer network with restricted access for documents about covert operations or other highly sensitive information. The telcon, which was classified as secret, did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective.\n\nOne of the two people familiar with how foreign leader calls are handled in the Trump White House said putting a document classified only as 'secret' into a server holding very highly classified information is not against any rule, but is a means of 'leak prevention.'\n\nThat person also said it wasn't common practice to put telcons into the more restrictive server, but that around the same time Bolton became national security adviser in the spring of 2018, it became standard not to share the telcons with the State Department, the national intelligence director and the Pentagon.\n\nThose officials were told that if they wanted to see them, they could read them the next time they were at the White House, the individual said.\n\n\n\n", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.kktv.com/content/news/Video-shows-mountain-lion-attacking-Colo-deputy-568740301.html ", "authors": [], "title": "Video shows mountain lion attacking Colo. deputy", "text": "Two people, including a Colorado sheriff\u2019s deputy, were attacked by a mountain lion.\n\nVideo shows a Colorado deputy being attacked by a mountain lion.

As he was leaving Freeport Health Network Memorial Hospital, Dukes said he was stopped by a white security guard who accused him of leaving the hospital to sell the IV equipment on eBay.\n\nThe guard called the Freeport Police Department, according to the post, and one of the responding officers told Dukes he was being arrested for attempted theft \"of the IV equipment that was clearly attached to my arm.\"\n\n'Lawyering while black': Attorney says deputy profiled him as a suspect at courthouse\n\n\"Officers stood by and watched while my IV was removed on the sidewalk, and it was NOT by a doctor,\" Dukes wrote. \"I told the Sgt I was being treated for pneumonia and asthma, and his words were, 'I don't care why you're here, you're going to jail.'\"\n\nCellphone video of Duke being handcuffed in his hospital gown has been viewed nearly 135,000 times on Facebook. While in transit after his arrest, Dukes said he had a seizure and an asthma attack, but the transporting officers didn't retrieve his inhaler until he became unresponsive.\n\n\"This is truly one of the most racist cities in America,\" Dukes wrote. \"I make this post not for pity, but as a beacon of hope for all black and brown minorities dealing with the City of Freeport.\"\n\nPolice, however, say Dukes' description of events is inaccurate and urged the public to \"reserve judgment\" while the incident is being reviewed. According to a statement from police, three people got into a \"verbal dispute\" with hospital security that resulted in their arrest on misdemeanor disorderly conduct charges.\n\nRacial profiling: A SWAT team surrounded a black gym owner at his business. No charges came. Now he's suing.\n\nTwo of the individuals were also charged with resisting or obstructing a peace officer, according to police. The statement also noted that Dukes' IV was removed by medical personnel, not security or police.\n\nPolice have since released body camera footage of the incident, which Freeport Police Chief Todd Barkalow told ABC News shows his officers \"handled it in the best way they could ... given the situation that they had in front of them.\"\n\n'You don't know my name': A Texas deputy tried to arrest the wrong black man, viral video shows\n\n\"It was determined that he was likely not trying to steal any of the property.

That's slightly more driving range than any car Tesla offers. Tesla claims a range of 390 miles for the latest version of its Model S Long Range sedan.\n\nGM's new battery cells will be used in several of its new fully electric models, including a recently unveiled self-driving electric car, the Cruise Origin , and a future Cadillac luxury SUV. GM also hopes to license its battery technology to other companies.\n\nThe announcement was part of a broader presentation on the company's aggressive plans for electric vehicles.\n\n\"GM is building toward an all-electric future because we believe climate change is real,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said during a presentation for media and investors.\n\nShe said the company would be investing more than $3 billion annually in electric vehicle research and development between 2020 and 2025.\n\n\"We want to put everyone in an EV, and we have what it takes to do it,\" Barra said.\n\nCheaper and more flexible batteries\n\nThe new battery cells, which GM named Ultium, are soft, flat pouches. (Electric vehicle batteries can have different forms. Tesla battery cells, for instance, are hard cylinders.) Usually, these sorts of pouch cells have to be lined up in horizontal rows with the pouches standing on edge like books in a bookshelf. The Ultium cells can be used that way or they can be stacked up vertically with the pouches laying on their sides. This gives car designers more flexibility because it allows the battery pack, which is made up of lots of these cells, to have a greater variety of shapes.\n\nThe Ultium battery cell uses a minimal amount of cobalt, an expensive ingredient for electric vehicle batteries, and that factor, combined with continuing manufacturing improvements, will drive prices down, the company said.\n\nGM promised the new battery cells will quickly come down in price to below $100 per kilowatt hour. Batteries make up a very large part of an electric vehicle's cost and $100 per kilowatt hour is often cited by industry analysts as the threshold that will enable electric cars to become truly cost competitive with traditional gasoline-powered vehicles.\n\nGM's next generation of electric cars will have new batteries that can hold more power.\n\nGM also boasted of its ability to adapt its existing facilities to manufacture electric cars. The company has already said that its Detroit Hamtramck assembly plant, which not long ago produced a variety of gasoline-powered vehicles, will now begin to manufacture only fully electric models.\n\nWith just batteries, cables and electric motors, electric vehicles have far fewer moving parts than gasoline engines, with pistons, valves and rods, and transmissions with multitudes of complex gears.\n\nGM executives believe that the company's new generation of electric vehicles will be profitable from the outset thanks to these reduced costs. GM admits that today's Chevrolet Bolt EV -- currently the only electric car GM sells in the United States -- is not profitable. Battery costs are a major factor in that.\n\nTaking on Tesla\n\nWhile GM did not specifically name any competitors, the comparisons to Tesla are clear. Tesla is the leading electric vehicle maker in the world. It built an enormous new battery factory in Nevada, a new car factory in China and is building another new factory in Germany. Tesla also currently builds its cars at its factory in Fremont, California, where GM and Toyota cars were once made.\n\nFor its part, Tesla is planning a Battery and Powertrain Investor Day for some time next month at which the company could announce significant advancements of its own.\n\nLess than 250,000 electric vehicles were sold in the US last year and 90% of those were Teslas, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n\nGM cited \"third party forecasters\" as saying electric vehicle sales in the United States could rise to about 3 million units by 2030. GM's own analysis predicts the figure could be \"materially higher\" as more electric vehicles are launched in popular markets and public charging networks grow, the company said.\n\nIn addition, GM engineers are already working on next-generation battery cells that could enable driving ranges of up to 600 miles, GM engineer Andy Oury said in a recorded presentation.\n\nGM also previewed a number of new fully electric car models the company plans to produce over the next few years. The Cruise Origin , a completely driverless vehicle was already unveiled in San Francisco last month. GM's Cruise autonomous driving subsidiary hopes to use it in a driverless ride-hailing service in San Francisco. No date has been set for that.\n\nA new version of the Bolt EV will be launched later this year, the company said, followed by a crossover SUV version, called the Bolt EUV, in the summer of 2021.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/airbus-survival-at-stake-without-immediate-action-ceo-memo-2151521", "authors": [], "title": "Airbus warns staff on jobs with its 'survival at stake'", "text": "2/2 \u00a9 Reuters.

It also issued targets for wide-body jets implying cuts up to 42% compared with previously published rates.\n\n\"In other words, in just a couple of weeks we have lost roughly one-third of our business,\" Faury wrote in the letter, which was earlier reported by Bloomberg News. \"And, frankly, that's not even the worst-case scenario we could face\".\n\nReuters reported on April 3 that Airbus was looking at scenarios involving output cuts of up to a half, and analysts say Boeing is expected to unveil comparable cuts along with lay-offs this week, lowering monthly 787 output to as low as 6 jets.\n\nFaury said Airbus's new production plan would remain for as long as it took to make a more thorough assessment of demand, adding this would probably be between two and three months.\n\nHe said it was too early to judge the shape and pace of a recovery, but mentioned scenarios including a short and deep crisis with a fast rebound or a longer and more painful downturn with previous demand levels only returning after 5 or 10 years.\n\nAnalysts and airlines have so far mostly spoken of a downturn lasting no more than 3-4 years.\n\nRival Boeing (N: ), with even weaker finances due to the year-old grounding of its 737 MAX, scrapped a $4.2 billion tie-up with Brazil's Embraer on Saturday in a move widely seen as triggered by the crisis, though it cited contractual reasons.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the aviation industry will emerge into this new world very much weaker and more vulnerable than we went into it,\" Faury wrote.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/01/politics/saoirse-kennedy-hill-granddaughter-robert-kennedy-death-certificate/index.html", "authors": ["Bob Crowley"], "title": "Saoirse Kennedy Hill, granddaughter of Robert F.

You wonder who these teams are that have grown wary of Irving. The Knicks? The Lakers? The Clippers? Call me crazy, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say if Irving says he wants to sign with any one of those teams, they won't be able to get the pen in his hand fast enough.\n\nIrving's behavior this season is a fair concern, however. The guy clearly brought the Celtics down off the court to a greater degree than he lifted them on it, and that's saying something considering he had perhaps the best season of his career. But all year long he questioned teammates and made mountains out of molehills, turning every bad game or even bad stretches of games into the end of the world.\n\nThe great irony all year long was Kyrie, time and again, telling the media, and anyone else who would listen, that his teammates didn't know how to win and that, implicitly, he was the only one who could teach them if only they would just listen.

The announcement follows his endorsement this week by three members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Their support could help allay any renewed concerns about Bloomberg's use of \"stop and frisk\" policies while he was the mayor of New York City.\n\nEarlier this week, an audio recording of a 2015 speech leaked, during which Bloomberg can be heard defending racial profiling employed in stop-and-frisk.\n\nIn the audio recording Bloomberg can be heard saying that \"95% of your murders and murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. You can just take the description and Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male minorities 15 to 25.\"\n\nBloomberg, who appeared to be defending the policy's efficacy because it was meant to protect people who live in high-crime neighborhoods, continued, \"That's true in New York. That's true in virtually every city in America. And that's where the real crime is. You've got to get the guns out of the hands of the people that are getting killed.\"\n\nHouston Mayor Sylvester Turner on February 12, 2020 KHOU-TV\n\nBefore he entered the race, Bloomberg apologized for stop and frisk. After the recording surfaced, his campaign released a statement saying that \"this issue and my comments about it do not reflect my commitment to criminal justice reform and racial equity.\"\n\nCongressional Black Caucus member Congresswoman Lucy McBath said in her statement of support for Bloomberg, \"Nobody running for president has done more for the gun violence prevention movement than Mike.\"\n\nCBS News has also exclusively learned that Turner plans to help officially launch Bloomberg's newest initiative, Mike for Black America. The program will be aimed at both engaging black Americans on key issues for the black community and spearheading an organizing effort on Bloomberg's behalf.\n\nMike for Black America is related to other campaign initiatives designed to appeal to key constituencies, like Women for Mike, Jews for Mike and Ganamos con Mike. It also builds on plans like the Greenwood initiative, which is meant to respond to systemic inequities that have kept many Black Americans from achieving generational wealth.\n\nThe launch also comes in the wake of recent polls showing Bloomberg is making major strides in national polls including gains with black voters. A Quinnipiac poll this week put him in second place with the key Democratic voting bloc.\n\nTurner's endorsement of Bloomberg comes at a pivotal time in the campaign, as black voters who had planned to support Joe Biden may be searching for alternatives after his two lackluster finishes in the first two Democratic primary voting contests in Iowa, where he appears to have placed fourth, and in New Hampshire where he was a distant fifth. Turner, the mayor of one of the most diverse cities in the U.S., joins a growing list of black mayors across the country throwing their weight behind Bloomberg.\n\nTurner, whose leadership in addressing Houston's recovery after the massive destruction wrought by Hurricane Harvey has been praised, was also named national co-chair for the Bloomberg campaign's Infrastructure Council, where he will advise on strategy and policy.\n\n\"As mayor, Mike embraced New York's diversity and made smart investments that brought better infrastructure and greater opportunity to all five boroughs.\" Turner said in a statement released by the campaign. \"We need a president who knows how cities run.

In days past, \u201cCalifornia or bust!\u201d could be seen on the sides of wagons as people rushed West to seek their fortune in gold. Now, however, it seems more accurate to say \u201cLeave California or bust!\u201d as many independent contractors find out that new Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5) could put thousands of owner-operated truckers and other drivers, such as those for Uber and Lyft, out of business.\n\nAnother one of Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s schemes to come under fire, AB 5 makes it hard for companies to justify hiring independent contractors. In an op-ed for the Sacramento Bee, he wrote:\n\n\u201cContributing to this imbalance is the misclassification of workers, where companies eager to save on labor costs identify workers as \u2018independent contractors\u2019 rather than employees. Workers lose basic protections like the minimum wage, paid sick days and health insurance benefits. Employers shirk responsibility to safety net programs like workers\u2019 compensation and unemployment insurance. Taxpayers are left to foot the bill.\u201d\n\nAlso known as the gig worker bill, AB 5 threatens the livelihood of many independent contractors as well as businesses that depend on them. First introduced in December last year, the bill and seeks to codify Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court of Los Angeles. The case determined that Dynamex wrongfully classified its workers as independent contractors based on the assumption that \u201ca worker who performs services for a hirer is an employee for purposes of claims for wages and benefits.\u201d As a result, the ABC test was put into place.\n\nAccording to HDT, \u201cThe ruling required companies to use a newly adopted ABC test to determine who is an independent contractor, which consists of certifying:\n\n\u201cA That the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the contract for the performance of the work and in fact; \u201cB That the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business; and \u201cC That the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed.\u201d\n\nThe Western States Trucking Association told its members during a meeting in May, \u201cMost legal analysis of the ruling agrees the ABC test sets an impossible standard for most of our members to meet,\u201d especially the B provision.\n\nShawn Yadon, CEO of the California Trucking Association (CTA), said that amendments could have helped protect the \u201c70,000 predominantly minority-owned truckers currently operating as independent contractors.\u201d He added:\n\n\u201cThere is no reason why protecting workers does not include defending the right of tens of thousands of drivers who have built their businesses around the independent owner-operator model, invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in their trucks and have operated their own businesses for decades.\u201d\n\nLabor unions have been pushing the bill, but, as Yadon noted, the bill doesn\u2019t distinguish between a driver under a truck lease-purchase program and one who owns the truck outright. \u201cIt virtually destroys the independent contractor model for trucking.\u201d\n\nThe state already suffers from residents and businesses moving on to greener \u2013 and less expensive \u2013 pastures, and AB 5 only worsens this trend.

The Justice Department has also declined to prosecute him.\n\nAnd while the report rebuked Comey, it did not cast aspersions on the integrity of the Russia investigation, which former special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerMueller report fades from political conversation Trump calls for probe of Obama book deal Democrats express private disappointment with Mueller testimony MORE wrapped up in March. The special counsel did not find evidence to charge members of the Trump campaign with conspiring with Russia, and did not reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice.\n\nComey is unapologetic\n\nRather than acknowledging any personal fault following the release of the report Thursday, Comey immediately went after his GOP critics, who he claimed defamed him.\n\nThe former FBI chief and prominent Trump critic attacked the president and other Republicans who asserted that he leaked classified information to the media.\n\nWhile the Horowitz report found he had mishandled classified information, it did not find evidence that Comey or his associates shared memos with the media that contained classified information \u2014 a key conclusion Comey seized on.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a \u2018sorry we lied about you\u2019 would be nice,\u201d Comey tweeted.\n\n\u201cAnd to all those who\u2019ve spent two years talking about me \u2018going to jail\u2019 or being a \u2018liar and a leaker\u2019\u2014ask yourselves why you still trust people who gave you bad info for so long, including the president.\u201d\n\nThe response sparked a wave of backlash, with critics pointing out that his failure to follow FBI policies resulted in the rebuke from Horowitz.\n\nMedia leaks back in spotlight\n\nThe sudden spotlight on Comey has also renewed a focus on media leaks.\n\nWhile Comey did not leak classified information to the press, the details he did push into the public light had major consequences for the Trump administration and the country as a whole.\n\nThe former FBI chief told the Senate in 2017 that he gave his friend, Columbia University professor Daniel Richman, a memo with the intention he would leak it to the press and prompt the appointment of a special counsel.

He also noted that Comey\u2019s actions would only likely affect him if he were to ever apply for a security clearance again.\n\n\u201cRealistically, the only thing available is if he is ever eligible for a security clearance again, that this will be a factor in that determination,\u201d Zaid said. \u201cIt may not be sufficient to impact anything, but it would definitely and most certainly be a factor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they could come up with a theory to kind of go after him, but nothing that would fly, and not one that they would want the precedent of even if Trump was pushing for it,\u201d he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFocus shifts to other investigations\n\nWith the Comey report out, focus will now shift to the remaining investigatory threads stemming from the Russia probe.\n\nThe inspector general is said to be near the end of his investigation into whether the FBI followed proper protocol when applying for the warrant to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. A report on those findings is expected any day.\n\nTo Trump\u2019s satisfaction, Barr has also ordered a separate investigation into whether the original intelligence collection on the Trump campaign was adequately predicated, led by the U.S. attorney in Connecticut.\n\nTrump has given Barr rare powers in the investigation to declassify material related to it. Democrats have widely criticized Trump of trying to weaponize the intelligence community to go after his political opponents.\n\nBut Republicans are eager to see whether the probes validate their claims that officials abused surveillance powers by using information from the so-called Steele dossier in their pursuit of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant against Page.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.silverandblackpride.com/2019/7/10/20689449/nfl-com-ranks-raiders-triplets-as-13th-best-in-league", "authors": ["Jul"], "title": "NFL.com ranks Raiders \u2018triplets\u2019 as 13th-best in league", "text": "Today, NFL.com\u2019s Ari Bhanpuri released his rankings for each team\u2019s set of \u2018triplets\u2019- that is, their quarterback, running back and primary receiver. The concept of having triplets came into vogue in the early 1990s when the Dallas Cowboys had Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin. The concept largely ignored the fact that the Cowboys at the time had what is likely the best offensive line ever, but the quality of their skill position players didn\u2019t hurt.\n\nBhanpuri looks favorably upon the Raiders\u2019 three primary skill players, ranking them 13th in the NFL and saying this:\n\n\u201cI fully recognize that I\u2019m higher on Carr than most, but I truly think the sixth-year pro is set to have a career season. After battling injuries and a roster overhaul the past couple years, Carr has been supplied the surrounding talent he needs to recapture his MVP-caliber form from 2016. Perhaps the biggest reason for my faith in the Raiders\u2019 franchise passer is the arrival of Antonio Brown -- far and away the most productive receiver of the past decade. Sure, he just turned 31 and, of course, has been involved in some distracting off-field dramas. But just last year, he caught 104 passes for 1,297 yards and a career-best 15 receiving touchdowns. His work ethic has become a thing of legend and is why he should be able to sustain his Hall-of-Fame-level play this season and well beyond. However, for both Carr and Brown to really take off, they\u2019ll need help from the run game -- something Oakland has received little of the past two seasons. Football minds much smarter than mine raved about Jacobs in the pre-draft process, with NFL.com draft analyst Daniel Jeremiah ranking him No. 8 on his top 100 prospects list. Hard for me to rank the rookie much higher than 23rd here without a single pro snap on his ledger. If DJ\u2019s right, though -- as he often is -- expect Jacobs to quickly climb the RB ladder.\u201d\n\nHowever, Bhanpuri was even more kind to two of Oakland\u2019s division rivals, ranking Kansas City\u2019s trio of Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce and Damien Williams 5th and the Chargers\u2019 trio of Philip Rivers, Melvin Gordon and Keenan Allen 2nd best behind only New Orleans. The Broncos are 29th, and that at least we can all agree on.\n\nThere is no real question that Oakland\u2019s skill position players are in the upper echelon of the NFL this year after being absolutely putrid in 2018. But just like the Cowboys of old, it will all come down to how well the offensive line plays. They will be the ones to give Derek Carr time to use all his shiny new toys. If the Raiders offense comes together, it has the tools to be one of the most explosive units in the league.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shakira-bikini-designed-herself", "authors": ["Melissa Roberto"], "title": "Shakira wows in purple bikini she designed herself", "text": "Colombian sensation Shakira heated up Instagram on Monday by modeling a unique bikini she said she designed herself.\n\nThe 43-year-old singer, who stunned millions with her epic Super Bowl LIV halftime performance alongside Jennifer Lopez in February, showed off her toned legs and backside while on a beach.\n\n\"This is a new bathing suit I designed and my friend Bego made for me.

Bernie Sanders at 16%, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 15% and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 14%. California Sen. Kamala Harris, at 7%, was the only other candidate to get above 2% in the poll.\n\nBut beyond the topline, here are some important factors to watch in Iowa.\n\nButtigieg and Warren show strength\n\nIn-person vs. virtual caucusgoers\n\nThis was our first poll in which we attempt to replicate a new rule in which 90% of delegates will be decided by in-person caucuses and 10% through virtual caucuses. Interestingly, our poll found that even though just 10% of delegates will be determined through virtual caucuses, 28% of likely caucusgoers say they will vote this way . If this divergence holds through the caucuses, it could mean that virtual caucusgoers will have their votes count for less.\n\nBiden's age\n\nA look at the data reveals multiple weaknesses for the frontrunner. One such potential weakness is that 46% of likely in-person caucusgoers think that a candidate over the age of 70 would be at a disadvantage against President Donald Trump. This even includes 29% of Biden's own supporters. This could be especially harmful for the now 76-year-old given that much of his sell to voters is his ability to beat Trump.\n\nWarren's segmented support\n\nThis was arguably Warren's best poll of the entire campaign. She's only 9 points behind the leader. At 38%, she scored the best very favorable rating (a variable strongly correlated with vote choice) among in-person caucusgoers. But just like nationally, Warren's struggling to get on the board with more moderate voters. She gets only 5% of self-identified moderate in-person caucusgoers in our poll. If Warren's going to win in Iowa (and especially in other states where moderates make up a larger share of the vote ), she'll likely have to do better.\n\nSanders' divided base\n\nBack in 2016, Sanders was the liberal and young voter alternative. He's not this year . Among the top five candidates in our poll, all but Biden do their best among in-person caucusgoers who call themselves either very liberal or somewhat liberal. All but Biden also do their best among those under 45 years old. This presents both opportunity and danger for these four candidates. If they can coalesce these groups, it could be golden for them. If they can't, Biden may be able to sneak out a win on the backs of moderate and older voters.\n\nThe 15% threshold", "tweets": [], "spans": []}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/06/investing/asian-market-latest-yuan-currency-trade/index.html", "authors": ["Laura He", "Cnn Business"], "title": "Asian markets are cautiously moving higher.

This model is based on projections.\n\nHere's what a measles outbreak could look like in Houston What would a real-life measles epidemic look like? Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have developed an agent-based modeling system that shows the worst case measles scenario at the county or metropolitan area level. Now Playing: Here's what a measles outbreak could look like in Houston AD:\n\nThe Texas model uses real numbers, where simulations drill down to show infection risks at the individual school level.\n\nClick through the gallery above to see simulations of a real-time measles outbreak in Houston.\n\n\"About year and a half ago, the Texas branch of the American College of Pediatricians contacted us,\" Dr. Mark Roberts, Director of the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh, told Chron.com.\n\n\"They asked if we could do the simulation with actual data.\"\n\nRoberts said his team also used data from the U.S. Department of Education, which provided the location and size of the schools, and from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which provided employment details.\n\nWhile the model shows the upper number of measles cases that could plausibly be expected to occur, it does not include the effect of any public health interventions after an outbreak starts, such as mass vaccination programs or increased isolation rates.\n\nOn HOUSTON CHRONICLE.COM: Study: Harris County at high risk to measles outbreak\n\n\"In the simulators, households wake up and then the kids go to school and the adults go to work,\" Roberts said. \"They go from home to school to work, and back and forth over and over again.\"\n\nThe projections allow you to watch while a measles outbreak spreads among school children and adult workers, Roberts said.\n\nHowever, the simulation is still highly accurate, Roberts said.\n\n\"You could argue it's not exact, but, boy, it's pretty close,\" Roberts said.\n\nMoreover, researchers created two graphs showing the population broken into two categories.\n\nThe first group is made up of bystanders, including those for whom the vaccination failed (3% of people do not gain immunity after vaccination) and those who are ineligible for vaccination due to medical conditions.\n\nThe second group, called the refusers, includes those who refuse to be vaccinated.\n\nIf you choose not to vaccinate your child, it affects all others including the bystanders who are not unprotected by choice, Roberts noted.\n\nThis demonstrates the importance of a high vaccination rate in order to protect the community, according to FRED researchers.\n\nMeasles, which are highly infectious, have re-emerged as a public health threat after having been largely eradicated by 2000, according to the Houston Chronicle. Harris County ranks the ninth most at risk county of having clusters of people contract measles, the Houston Chronicle reported.\n\nTo see simulations for Texas and other states, head to the Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics' website.\n\nMarcy de Luna is a digital reporter.

XRP settled above the $0.4200 level and it is likely to accelerate above $0.4500.\n\nRipple Price Analysis\n\nYesterday, we saw the start of a strong rally in ripple price above the $0.3500 resistance against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair broke many resistance near the $0.3800 level and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The pair is up more than 40% in the past three days and it recently cleared the $0.4000 resistance level. The upward move was strong as the price cleared the $0.4200 resistance. A new 2019 high was formed near the $0.4480 level and the price is currently in a strong uptrend.\n\nIt is testing the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $0.3754 low to $0.4482 high. On the downside, there are many supports near the $0.4220 and $0.4180 levels. There is also a major ascending channel forming with support near $0.4080 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The channel support is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent wave from the $0.3754 low to $0.4482 high. Therefore, if there is a downside correction, the price may find support near the $0.4200 or $0.4100 area.\n\nOn the upside, a break above the channel resistance could push the price above $0.4500. The next key resistance is near the $0.4600, above which the price is likely to accelerate towards the $0.4800 level. In the best case, the bulls may even target the $0.5000 level in the next three sessions.\n\nLooking at the chart, ripple price is placed in a strong uptrend above $0.4200 and $0.4100. If the price starts a major downside correction, there are chances of a break below $0.4000. The main support is near the $0.3740, where the bulls may appear. Overall, the price is likely to remain strong and trade towards $0.4800 or even $0.5000.\n\nTechnical Indicators\n\nHourly MACD \u2013 The MACD for XRP/USD is currently placed heavily in the bullish zone, with positive signs.\n\nHourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) \u2013 The RSI for XRP/USD is currently near the 70 level, with a flat structure.\n\nMajor Support Levels \u2013 $0.4200, $0.4100 and $0.4080.\n\nMajor Resistance Levels \u2013 $0.4500, $0.4600 and $0.4800.", "tweets": [], "spans": []}]
